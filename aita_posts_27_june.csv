c6feli	2019-06-28 03:58:39	og_snake	AITA for not speaking to my brother in law?	"So my brother in law has been married to my sister for about a year now. Before they got married, he was all about being a part of the family. He really put forth a lot of effort to get to know me and my dad. Well, as soon as the wedding happened that all stopped. I came home from the Army and got a job and an apartment that was about 5 minutes away from their place. I was genuinely excited because it was close and I figured he and I would become really close.

Well for the 6 months we lived there, we saw each other maybe 3 times. Not for lack of trying, I invited him to do all types of things. Getting a beer after work, playing video games, going to the gym. You name it I tried it.

The main thing that totally turned me off to even putting forth effort was when we saw each other (randomly) at the grocery store. We walked around and did our shopping together and he invited me to his place to have a couple beers and play video games. I said that was cool but I had to run home and put away my groceries first. He said that he was going to double check with my sister and that he'd let me know. There was no text, at all. I would have respected if he changed his mind but he literally ghosted me and never even acknowledged he did it. This was just the icing on the cake, there is a multitude of other times he did stuff like this. I could go on for a while but I think you guys get the point.

He has tried being all buddy buddy with me recently and I haven't reciprocated the effort. We both moved places and he lives significantly further away now. I tried for 6 months to develop a relationship with him when he lived basically across the street. My sister is not happy with me and is taking his side. My dad agrees with me and has seen a lot of the same things I am talking about here.

c6fd4t	2019-06-28 03:54:35	BetterScallion	AITA for not hosting my cousin's girlfriend's baby shower?	"My cousin and his girlfriend are having a baby out of wedlock. This is a HUGE deal in my family. As a result, nobody in the family is willing to host a baby shower for her. Nobody in her family is willing to either. Everyone here is over 18.

As the ""secular"" one in my family, it's somehow fallen on me to throw her one as I'm the only female relative that doesn't have particular morals against it. They'll all go to a baby shower for an unmarried woman, but throwing one is ""showing support"".

I don't want to do it for several reasons: 

1. I'm busy. I really don't want to deal with the logistics of throwing a party. I'd have to go out of state (where the family all lives), rent a park or something, and deal with all of the food and decorations. I'm straight up way too tired. 

2. I'm broke. I do not have cash money for a large party. This would be wedding sized, and nobody's willing to lend $$ towards it.

3. It's honestly upsetting for me. I've never been able to get someone to even call me their girlfriend. At this rate, I doubt I'll ever be able to get married and have children of my own. I don't want to spend money and time for a stark reminder of something I can never have.

I've said that I was busy and didn't have time, but they don't seem to get it. I'm getting crying calls from the mother to be crying that I'm the reason she can't have a celebration for her baby. Am I really the asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c6fcl7	2019-06-28 03:53:00		AITA for ignoring my aunt on her birthday	"Today was my dad’s sister’s (my aunt’s) birthday. She lives in our home country but recently flew to the country we live in now to visit.

My family recently moved and we invited my aunt and relatives to our new home to celebrate her birthday. We’ve been here for about a week, so while we have set up most things, we haven’t fully finished unpacking and cleaning. There are no more boxes, and we have put most things in their respective places, but there are some odds and ends in the corners. 

The first thing my aunt says when she sees the house is that it’s not a mansion. I mean it’s a 3 bedroom single family home, but I think the way she pointed it out was quite rude as if she were expecting some massive, elaborate house. No one has implied that this house is grand like a mansion or said that it is anything close to a mansion. She proceeded to state that all the houses in the country we live in now could not compare to the houses in our home country. This irked me because she has literally only seen 2 houses here in this country.

The final situation which made me not want to engage with her was when my mom said that we’d invite her back after we tidy up for a few days. My aunt retorted, “A few DAYS? I think you’ll need MONTHS to tidy up all the clutter here” and promptly walked away. Firstly, I don’t think “a few days” was meant to be taken literally, but it doesn’t matter because we could definitely clean up the clutter within a day or two. Her response was so rude and uncalled for especially after we opened our home to her. 

In addition to her comments, she has never tried to converse with me. I always greet her and I have tried to intimate conversations but she mostly just ignores me. My parents told me that I’m being rude by not trying to talk to her on her birthday."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c6fc6x	2019-06-28 03:51:51	wlsosoencxkdo	AITA for being annoyed over my boyfriends gift?	"Throwaway account & on mobile!

So I’m really not a materialistic person... I love gifts that have thought put into them over something that’s expensive. I would rather have something that was handmade over some expensive brand named purse that I’ll probably use once or twice. Not to say I’m not appreciative of those gifts, it’s just a preference. Well, my boyfriend has a different taste. He loves having the best technology and will spend hundreds/thousands of dollars to do so which isn’t a problem at all. I don’t mind getting those kinds of gifts for him as well. For example I recently bought him a $400 gaming headset because it’s something he’s been wanting. And I’m not trying to say this is a daily thing. We buy each other gifts when it’s close to our anniversary or holiday. And sometimes just to surprise the other person but this is on rare occasions. We just had our 4 year anniversary and I had got him something that took a big chunk of my money... It was all to help him build a computer which is what he’s been wanting to do for a while. When it comes to him giving me gifts though, it’s usually jewelry or an expensive date. I just wanted something sentimental for once for our 4 years. And he did really well and got me a necklace with his initials on it. I was really happy till he said something like “Yeah, super cheap I only paid $60 for it” and he honestly could’ve gone without saying that. So I got upset and told him I appreciated the thought in the gift (I literally gave him the idea) but I didn’t think it was cool for him to say that. He said I’m being a materialistic asshole and the price doesn’t matter. My annoyance had nothing to do with the price. Although that is kind of annoying as well. I just think it’s unfair that I spend a lot of money and time into thinking about my gifts for him and he kinda just gets stuff last minute and seems like there’s no thought into it.

c6fc34	2019-06-28 03:51:35	AndrewFeelsMediocre	AITA for Not Changing my Character's Name?	Okay, so me and my friend, Daniel, are both trans guys. He's further along in his transition, me not even being fully out to more than a few people. Me and him ride the same bus home afterschool, and we've sat next to each other since 5th grade. Sometimes we talk, sometimes we listen to music, depends on the day. When we talk, a common theme is to talk about our Ocs (Original Characters). We both really love writing, and have Ocs that we've spent years working on. One of the stories I'm working on writing is called The Forest of Nightcrest. One of the main characters just so happens to be named Harley. Harley is pretty close to Daniel's dead name, but we don't call him that, so my brain didn't even connect the two. I had been calling her that for at least a month before I introduced her to him. When he first heard her name, he already decided he didn't like her. He made a face that portrayed a mix of disgust and dislike. When I asked why he didn't like her, he explained that he felt it was too close to his dead name. I didn't do anything about it other than stop mentioning her as much, but he keeps making a point to talk about her name and how he doesn't like her. I get that it probably hurts for him, but because of the plot, the character has to have a name that starts with an H and I don't think I could get any further away from his dead name.

c6fbzm	2019-06-28 03:51:16	iamme4005	WIBTA if I didn't tell my sibling about money they are legally entired to, to my benefit	"Hi guys.  I'm really conflicted about this and wanted an outside perspective.

My Mum passed away last year.  Her will was that funds were to be shared equally between me and my sibling, taking into account any amounts gifted while still living.

We had thought this meant my sibling wouldn't be entitled to anything because they both were given and stole a huge amount of money from my mum when she was still alive.
However because they had access to mums bank account and debit cards it's difficult to prove plus they only looked at the last 3 years and this was going on for at least 7 years.  The hard to prove transactions are things like my mum never knew how to use a mobile however there were multiple purchases on her card for expensive phones so we know this was my sibling but there's no real proof this wasn't a purchase of mums.

This means there is a small inheritance available for my sibling should they contact the lawyer.
If they don't contact the lawyer after a certain point the funds default to me.

Sibling has, unfortunately, been going in a downward spiral for years. They are drunk all the time, smashed multiple cars driving under the influence, at least one conviction when caught.  Hasn't been able to hold down a job for more than a few weeks.
They had elderly mum sign a contract for a new car for them, crashed it and abandoned it within a year, all at mums cost.  Sibling got internet banking for mum to help pay her bills when mobility was an issue but didn't pay her bills, just siphoned money for themselves until I found all these past due bills and I had to pay them.

I am not in contact in any way with my sibling, I tried in the past discuss addiction, therapy, then resorted to telling them many times their behaviour was not appropriate and tried to block access to mums money and they didn't like being called on their BS so became very unpleasant to me since then we have been no contact. Honestly they were like a black hole that soaked up my families time, energy and worry.  They always seemed to get worse and never better, no desire to help themselves.  Sibling is outwardly confident and charming but incredibly manipulative.  

I have no idea if they are getting their life together or if they are continuing to sponge of others.

Thing is, while I hate the person my sibling is now, we were best mates growing up and I still worry for them.  If they have been able to give up drinking I'd love to try to help them. But while legally sibling may be entitled we all know they took more than double the amount remaining so they really aren't entitled to it.

I am not the executor of the estate.  According to the lawyer theres no legal requirement for them or the executor to contact sibling, they just need to pay if sibling contacts them.  All I need to do is continue my life as is.

I am getting some inheritance regardless if sibling contacts lawyer.  I feel very guilty so I think I am in the wrong here however other family are adamant brother should get nothing.

The question is wether I’m an asshole for telling her about it, not the act itself. The act itself went unnoticed. 

The money was never a known entity leading up to the expenditure. Additionally, the money was never missed. We’ve always had the correct amount of money to resolve any urgent matter. 

We are financially stable nowadays. At the time of the spending, we were much less financially secure.

c6faj2	2019-06-28 03:46:50		WIBTA for going on more vacations because my family gave me money for school?	"Many of the members of my family pitched in to give me money for university. It’s an incredible gesture and I’m eternally thankful. 

Last year, I worked all year during school and, because I had the money my family had given me, I could afford to spend some of the money I’d amassed on a trip to Costa Rica during the summer. 

This year I was thinking of doing the same thing, until I heard from my dad that one of my uncles felt I was living too lavishly and that his children could never have afforded to go on vacations during school because they had to spend all summer working to pay for school. 

I’d like to point out that I didn’t use any of the money my family gave me to travel, only the money I earned from work. 

At this point, I’m kind of torn. On the one hand, the reason I felt I could travel is because of the money my family has given me. And I totally understand where my uncle is coming from. 

On the other hand, I don’t know if it’s entirely reasonable to be expected not to travel at all for the next five years. Your 20s is the best time to travel because you don’t have all the responsibilities of adulthood.

I honestly don’t know what to do. 

So, WIBTA if I kept traveling?"		1	0

c6f8sp	2019-06-28 03:41:57	I_Am_YungAce	AITA for not seeing my girlfriend’s father while he was in the ER?	"So rewind to Wednesday night this week. I hadn’t seen my girlfriend all day and chatted on the phone for roughly 1 hour before we both went to bed. We got off the phone and 20 minutes later she calls me back. Her brother had called her and told her EMS was at her parents house and she told me she was on her way to the ER so I had to calm her down. I headed out of my house called my mother and let her know what was going on and rushed to the ER. 

When I got there my girlfriend was in tears and she ran to me bawling and hugged me. Her dad had been screaming in excruciating pain, and was in so much pain he was going into shock. Nobody had any idea what was going on. So her, me, and her 2 brothers sat in the waiting room waiting for news. Her mom came out into the waiting room and sat with us saying he has calmed down a bit after giving him pain meds. They decided to do CT scans to figure out what was wrong

After MULTIPLE HOURS of waiting. We later learned he had a ruptured bladder, and had fluid all in his abdomen. He was going to be okay and is stable. They said 2 people can go back and see him so I told my girlfriend to go ahead and I will stay here while she does. Their family all takes turns to go see him and I politely declined as I didn’t want to feel intrusive or rude. We went home shortly after around 3-4 am and I slept at my girlfriends house. 

Fast forward to Today (Thursday) after multiple updates on his recovery. I went over to my girlfriend house to see her after work. She asked me why I didn’t go see her dad at the ER. I told her I didn’t wanna feel invasive on their privacy or rude. After all it is her father and not mine. She wasn’t upset but she looked at me weird and changed the subject. Now i feel like an asshole for not visiting him. AITA?

TL;DR - Girlfriend’s father got rushed to the ER. After learning he was stable and okay we got told we can go back and see him, but only 2 at a time. I politely declined due to bot wanting to be rude but now feel like an asshole.

Edit: to clarify, we have been together for 4 months and I am somewhat close to her family. I spend a lot of time over at her parents house and have gone on trips with their family."	No A-holes here	0	0

c6f5mf	2019-06-28 03:33:14	todoe18	AITA for ignoring my cousin about our moving in together	"Quite long, sorry.

So, basically about six months ago, me, my sister, and my cousin all thought it would be a great idea for us to move in together. The lease for my current apartment is done in July, so this was perfect. We were really excited to do this. We looked at apartments and made Pinterest boards to design our living space. 

At first, we had trouble deciding which apartment we wanted to live in. One like the cheap one in a bad neighborhood, the other liked the townhomes, and the other like the apartment near all our jobs. My sister thought this was too much and back out with four months left. 

It was just me and my cousin left. We both figured out where we’d like to live. She said she had a friend who was leaving their two bedroom apartment at the end of June so we thought that amazing. 

Up comes June and neither had taken action to look at or even sign a lease for the apartment. I then asked her if she'd still like to move in together and she said, ”yes I still want to”. Her exact words. 

Bad shit had been happening so much to me around then. I lost my full-time position at work, cutting my hours from 40 to 29. I've had trouble finding another job since. So hearing that she still wanted to made me happy. Three days later though, I asked when the best time would be for her to go and sign a lease. 

She then said she was having second thoughts about moving in together because she didn't get a scholarship for school. I was devastated, so I just replied ”okay” and haven't said anything since until today. It pissed me off too, because she wasn't the only one struggling with money and school. She texted me a couple of days later saying we should call and talk about it but I just left her on read.  

This has caused drama now as I told my sister because we are very close. They are now arguing because of it. I also told my father and sisters-in-law about it which I don't think I should have done, as they talk shit about every other family member.

c6f5ai	2019-06-28 03:32:17		AITA for not giving my parents a chance to speak after they told me they read my texts and “discovered” I was dating a girl?	"So just a little background -  my (22f) family is super traditional & conservative- like think of a religious & “Christian” family that goes to church every Sunday, bible study every Wednesday ....that kind of thing.  

I am bisexual but never told my parents out of fear (because they have said many times they see homosexuality as an “abomination” and outside of “God’s will”).  I dated a girl - Lilly- my senior year of university & never told anyone in my family. 

So this past year after I graduated, I did a year long research project in Guatemala and ended up getting mugged at knifepoint during the first month & my iPhone was stolen. I contacted my family to wipe my phone & my parents asked for my iCloud username/ password so they could do it and I obliged, not really thinking anything of it. I bought a cheap phone & continued my research for the rest of the year. 

When I returned back to my home country yesterday my parents pulled me aside to “talk” and said “we found out about Lilly” and then proceeded to tell me that when I gave them my iCloud, they read all of my text messages and had known all year...my mom started to tear up and say something about homosexuality not being “God’s will” and I just lost it. I blew up and told them that they couldn’t control my life anymore and that if they couldn’t accept me for who I was then maybe I didn’t want any part of this God or family and basically stormed out. 

What really upset me is that when my parents visited me in January, I had a heart to heart conversation with my mom about homosexuality and how I just didn’t understand how loving another human could be wrong and a sin (not talking about myself personally bc I still had not ever told them- just in general) and my mom looked at me in my face KNOWING that I didn’t know she knew about Lilly and went on and on about how it just wasn’t “God’s plan” and what not and that people got into same sex relationships because they’ve been “hurt by men”. 
 
The thing is that after all of this, my dad texted me and said that he will always support me and love me no matter what life choices I make...so now I feel bad that I didn’t even give him a chance to speak...I just feel like I felt like my privacy had been invaded.

"For reference, I work at a hospital and work full time at the very least (40 hours, usually more, I sit with at risk patients for injury, falls, or confusion in general) and we are severely short staffed and are going through leadership changes (note that many different hospital staff members can do the same job I do, but they usually choose not to do it)

Well anyways, today I get into work and already work from 3-11 pm and I am supposed to work tomorrow the same shift, the nursing staff leader asks me (like they do almost every week or 2 at the least) to stay until 3 am, which normally wouldn't bother me unless I have to work the very next successive day, like this time

Now I know at least 2 things about now/tomorrow, first is that I will most assuredly be tired from lack of sleep, because I'll get home around 4 am and I can't get to sleep instantly, never could, and I have to be up at a normal morning time around 9-10 at the latest to do my normal daily activities before work, and secondly, I know that I'll be in a crap mood due to this, not to mention the fact that apparently we are still one person shy for tomorrow even as it is currently, before I even potentially call in, which is ridiculous, forgot to mention we are on a hiring freeze as well, so no relief in the future even !

Really, I just need a break, this job wears you down fast, and by overstaffing the same employees, it strains the entire hospital, but I want to know if this would honestly make me the asshole, because I do feel bad because my job is my duty, but other people need to assume their duties too imo, thanks for listening/reading this and giving input, my conscience needs outside answers !"

this happend a while ago but i remembered it and cringed. 

I have a twin sister who is the complete opposite of me, it has caused some issues growing up as joined birthdays always failed because I hated princess and she hated pirates. 

it came up to our 16th birthday and we both got Taylor swift tickets, here is the issue I hate Taylor swift and my family knows that, I would always complain about how annoying she is. the only reason I got the ticket was because my sister is the biggest Taylor fan and mum wanted us to go together, mum did not care that I disliked the gift as she wanted to force me to go. 
it was also the only gift i got (I'm not complaining just mentioning)

I told mum (after the party had ended) that I really dislike Taylor swift and would rather not go but I would love to give my ticket to one of my sisters friends so my sister can enjoy it with someone who likes Taylor swift. 

mum got mad and called me ungrateful and told me that I should accept my gifts, I was forced to go, I had a horrible time and my sister was angry that mum made me go as she knows I hate Taylor swift. she wanted to take a friend with her, and I would of given my ticket if I was allowed.

c6eyyc	2019-06-28 03:14:24	Clearingenuity	AITA for not wanting my best friend to hang out with my mother and grandmother?	"My best friend and I met in 2013. We’ve been best friends ever since. I moved away from our hometown about 2 years ago to pursue career opportunities. Since then, she’s been hanging out with my grandmother and mother. They go out to eat, my best friend goes over their houses, she spends the night, they go to the movies, etc. It has even gone as far as my grandmother and best friend talking about moving in together.  With all of this being said, I’ve always found it weird in the back of my head but never said anything about it. 

Here’s my problem. My mother and grandmother tells her all of our “family” business. While she is my best friend, there are some things I feel shouldn’t be discussed with her about our family. I am a very private person and protective over my family. I don’t want my best friend calling me feeling like she can voice her opinions on my family members and discuss their issues. I’ve caught her and my mother being secretive, withholding things from me. In addition, I feel like she has befriended them to invade my privacy. For example, if i don’t answer the phone she’ll call one of my family members asking when’s the last time they talked to me, then gets upset if she feels like I’m ignoring her calls. She’s even called my grandmother stirring up conflict between us two. 

The last straw. My mother called me saying that my best friend asked to go out of town with them and asked me how ‘d I feel about it. I immediately told her I didn’t feel comfortable with that and things have gone too far. She proceeds to go back and forth, debating with me about how I’m “overreacting”. I get upset and end the conversation. After pondering for a while, I called both my mother and grandmother expressing my concerns and telling them that I don’t want them discussing anything private with my best friend and I want them to [not cut off all contact but] stop hanging out with her so much. My mother was understanding but my grandmother (who’s closest to her) wasn’t as understanding. I was asked by my mom to not address my best friend about this situation because she may take it the wrong way.  Knowing her, she will take it the wrong way and I’m 90% sure this may slightly harm our friendship but I honestly feel like I need to address this with her. Am I the asshole here?

Just to state a few things: 

I have never been close with my friends/significant others/best friends, relatives. While I know it isn’t uncommon, I’ve never been that person.

My best friend and I are close and I love her like a sister but I don’t tell her everything. I don’t tell anyone everything and I’m sure it’s vice versa."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6eyxe	2019-06-28 03:14:20	alexm42	WIBTA if I had taken a dog to the pound that my roommate agreed to watch without asking me?	"Honestly I feel like TA for even thinking it, but I feel my reasons would have been justified.

I live with my brother (J) and two of his friends (D and M.) M is very... Impulsive, to say the least. Somebody asked him to dog sit for a week and he said yes without asking the rest of us. He brought it up to J and D after he had already agreed, and they said it was ok, but the first I found out about it was when I came home and saw it. This was a problem for a few reasons.

First of all, having dogs on the property at all is a violation of our lease. I would have said no for this reason alone had I been asked first.

Second, it was a full sized poodle. J and D didn't think to ask ""how big?"" before saying it was fine, and M didn't think to mention it when asking. It was Wayyy too big for our tiny apartment, let alone his room which we had to confine it to, because of...

Reason number 3, and by far the most important and the only reason important enough to make me consider taking the dog to the pound. When we moved in together in September we collectively decided to get a cat. I like dogs. I probably would have gotten a dog had our lease not prohibited it. But cats were allowed so that's what we went with.

She's a rescue, surrendered to the shelter because of behavioral issues all stemming from severe anxiety. We (mostly J and myself) have given her all our love and care and she's improved soooo much in the 9 months since we got her. She's still a little anxious bean but the peeing outside the litter box and most of the other behavioral issues haven't been a problem since month 2, except for once in March when she got sick. I love her more than anything. Watching her grow to trust me, to derive emotional support from me (this isn't me attributing human behavior to an animal mind, either) has been extremely fulfilling.

But she could not handle the dog. She was terrified. She wouldn't come out from her hidey hole at all, not even to eat or drink. Normally if she hears a soda can that sounds halfway like her wet food she comes sprinting in from across the apartment, and she wouldn't even poke her head out to eat when we put the bowl within easy reach of her. She was not ok, it was seriously affecting her health, and that's why I considered taking it to the pound.

We ended up resolving the issue in a better way. M went home to his family for a night and took it with him, and then I had an already planned vacation back to my hometown with J to visit our family, and we took her with us when instead of leaving her in the care of M and D. So she only had to deal with the dog for a couple of nights. But if I hadn't had the vacation as an option I would have had to do something, right? My first responsibility is to my baby.

I know I'm probably gonna get YWBTA, it's not the dog or its owner's fault but I couldn't think of any better alternative so I'm mostly asking if anyone else thinks there was a better way to resolve this because it's eating at me."	Asshole	0	0
c6eyww	2019-06-28 03:14:18	smooshfluff	AITA for letting the phone ring when my boss called... Twice?	"My sister had a baby yesterday! Yay! 
She was in labor for more than 24 hours. I told my boss berforehand that I might need to call out when the baby comes. I had a seven hour shift scheduled the 25th when my sister called me in a panic because her water had broken. I of course drove her to the hospital and called out of work. 

Today was baby's first full day outside and since I had the day off I looked forward to spending it with her. Baby was fine but my sister had to stay in the hospital because she has high blood pressure and they wanted to monitor her for a couple days. Hopefully they will both be going home tomorrow. 

To get to the main point of my post, my boss started calling me earlier today and I just let it ring because I'm afraid of telling people no. I did have a scheduled day off today but it makes me feel bad because we need help right now since a couple of people are on vacation. I've been feeling guilty all day but I wanted to be there to support my sister. I was gone only a few hours that morning and she said it felt so long. The father isn't in the picture so there's no one else to keep her company and tell her what channel Bob's Burgers is on.

c6eyfu	2019-06-28 03:13:00	nursing_throwaway732	AITA for possibly getting my Professor fired?	"*Tl;dr: My professor in nursing school was embarrassed about goofing up and sitting in the wrong room for nearly an hour and took it out on us students. I wrote an anonymous email to the department chair and many other people reporting her behavior. My family and close friends that I told say that I shouldn’t have made a big deal out of her behavior.*

So, I’m a nursing student and on Monday, my class was told to go to a room for our lab hours through our online class site. We all were sitting in this room for 45 minutes with no instructor to be found. Eventually, the head of the program walked by and asked who our professor was, found the professor in the next room over, who was sitting in a room by herself wondering where her class of 35+ students were. She was clearly embarrassed and seemed to take this out on the class for the rest of the day. 

For example, she slammed a students personal laptop shut. She told people to “shut up or get out.” She yanked a stethoscope-that by school policy is required to be around our necks-off of a students neck, shoved it in his pocket, and told him he was going to get someone sick wearing this around his neck. Again, I’d like to reiterate, we were in a classroom setting, not a hospital setting. There were a few other examples of very unprofessional behavior that are detailed in the email that I’m linking to below and you can read through that if you’re interested. 


Now, to where I’m being called an asshole. I was not personally affected by any of her behavior, but I observed these things and it bothered me. So, I made an anonymous email account and sent an email to the department chair, VP of student affairs, the college dean, and the course coordinators and instructors. These people have launched an investigation into her behavior and there is now whispers from a loose lipped faculty member that the professor in question may be fired over this. 


I told my family about this, my boyfriend, and a couple close friends. They all think I’m an asshole because it didn’t affect me, so I had no business reporting her for what happened. They say that if anyone had a right to report her, they should have gone up the proper chain of command and it should have been someone she targeted.

Me and my girlfriend aren't getting married for a little while but we're discussing it because we want to get married within the next couple years. She wants to have both a best man and a maid of honor. Then she'll have bridesmaids and I'll have my bestman and my groomsman. The person she wants as her bestman is her cousin who she is super close with, but I was planning to have him be one of my groomsmen and have my brother as my bestman. 
Am I wrong to say she shouldn't have a best man and that we should only have one bestman and one maid of honor? This idea arose when she wasn't sure whether she was gonna marry a man or a woman(me and my girlfriend are both bisexual) and she decided that if she got married to a woman she would want to have him as the best man for the wedding and now she doesn't want to abandon that idea just because she's marrying a man. 
She has said that if I wanted to, I could have a maid of honor, but I argue back that even if I had someone that I would want to be my maid of honor, I wouldn't do that or ask for that because we shouldn't have two maids of honor. 
She also says that because shes really close with her cousin and he is /her/ cousin that he should be on her side. However, I don't think his cousinship is relevant. I dont think she should have a best man regardless of who that best man is.

TL;DR
My girlfriend wants to have a bestman for her in addition her maid of honor and my best man but I don't think we should have two best men. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

c6euvs	2019-06-28 03:03:28	mollymollyyy	AITA for not wanting my friend to hang out with my ex-friend?	"Players:
Chelsea - current best friend
Anna - ex friend

Anna is a wild person, always getting into crazy situations. I introduced her to Chelsea when I became close to her. The three of us hung out a few times together and it was fun.

I started to see Anna's true colors. She told me the story of how she cheated on her current boyfriend. He started to get really paranoid about her going out, and got a little controlling, so I helped her move out (in the middle of the night) and she stayed with me for a month and a half. Never helped me pay rent, even though she said she would.

Then, when I started dating my current boyfriend, I was really excited for him to meet Anna. ""She's crazy and hilarious and you'll love her.""

I invited her to hang out with a group of my boyfriend and I's mutual friends (Chelsea included) and she showed up cross-faded, made everyone really uncomfortable and was very touchy with me/making a LOT of sexual comments about me. (She is bi, and we would make jokes about that stuff frequently, but this was totally another level.)

I thought maybe she was just acting that way because she was cross faded. She acted the same way every time when he was around. When he wasn't, she was fine.

In October, she asked me if I could watch her cat for a month while she got into an apartment on Nov 1st. She offered me $100 to watch him.

She refused to buy him food. Chelsea was watching my apartment for a little while and Anna's cat ran out of the partial bag she sent with him so I told her just to text Anna and tell her and she can get her a new bag or send the money, whatever.

Anna told her she wasn't buying the food because she  gave me $100 ""for him."" That wasn't the deal, it pissed me off but fine, Chelsea doesn't like confrontation so she just paid for the food herself and let it go. I already had a cat so I just switched him over to the food my cat was eating and it was fine.

Her cat was also very mischevious and destroyed the blinds in my apartment, among other annoying things.

We hadn't spoken much that whole time and finally I made her come get the cat in February.

I kind of assumed that when Anna and I stopped being friends, that she was also going to stop being friends with her, because they really didn't hang out outside of when the three of us did. It shocked me when I saw they were still friends.

Chelsea agreed with me when all this was happening that she was being weird, that it was rude of her to make me pay for the cat food, she's selfish, etc (there are lots of little smaller stories that are too trivial to go into.)

Chelsea tries to hide it from me. She'll say she went out with ""a friend"" and I see on Anna's instagram story that it was her.

AITA for disliking when she still hangs out with Anna?

I feel like it's girl code, if your best friend doesn't like that bitch, you don't like that bitch. Especially if you weren't really friends with that bitch before.

"A few months ago my boyfriend discovered a new Dragon Ball Z fighting game that he’s thoroughly enjoying. He played it absolutely all the time. At first, it was great to see him enjoying himself. But as time went on and he began to play it constantly I just got annoyed and am now. 

He plays when we hang out on the weekends, the only time we really get together, he plays at his job which involves heavy machinery, he plays when we’re supposed to be eating dinner together or watching a new show. He will take a very long time to do things because he wants to finish a round and either zones out of conversations or ignores me completely. I wake up in the morning to him playing it and making it impossible to snuggle up with him. 

I feel really bad when I show annoyance or even decide to do something else besides watch him play, however. He gets so sad and deflates when he realizes it’s not holding my interest or I’m getting fed up. He’ll say things like “sorry I’m being a nerd” and eventually put it away. I feel like he’s showing me something he’s genuinely happy and excited about but my visible annoyance or exasperation after a while may make him feel embarrassed or sad or upset.

&#x200B;

When I was 5 my parents moved our family across the country for work. This, naturally, took us away from our extended family and around a year or two after that my grandfather on my father's side moved to be closer to us. When I was 10 my mother got cancer, she died 2 years later. During those 2 years her aunt and uncle visited simiregularly and my siblings and I spent a lot of time at our grandfather's house. After the funeral our grandfather moved away and apart from briefly visiting for graduations he's made no effort to maintain a relationship with me or my siblings. Since my mother died my siblings and I were completely disowned from her family. 

&#x200B;

Ok so now here's the issue. We're all adults now and I'm moving back near my home town with my dad since he can't work. My dad mentioned how excited he is for me to get to be a part of the family and I told him that I don't want to reconnect with my relatives. Now my dad's pissed, he's point blank told me that I have no choice but to spent holidays with these people and that me not wanting a relationship with them is closed minded. The plain and simple fact is that I don't love my relatives and I don't think sharing my blood entitles them to my time. I don't have a solid relationship with any of them and honestly I blame them. I was a child when we left, I didn't have a say in anything and none of my relatives made an effort to stay in touch. If just one of them would send me a text or a phone call once in a while maybe things would be different but at this point I just don't care. I want to emphasize that I don't have any malice for my relatives, I just don't know them and I don't care to know them at this point in my life.

c6eppa	2019-06-28 02:49:34		AITA for ending a friendship with someone who became basically a personal debt collector out of spite?	"Well here it goes. A friend and I recently had a falling out over 80 bucks. It began as he loaned me some items over a period of about 2 months and I had full intentions of repaying him as soon as school was out of session at the latest(uni), and ideally earlier. As finals week approached, the weekend before the beginning of the tests coincided with his birthday, but as I'm a full time student taking a significant course load I declined to return home for a mere 24 hour stay (not to mention a 220 mile round trip) just to see him over that weekend, when I should obviously be studying for classes I'm paying money to take. This combination sent him into a full fledged fit in a group chat with several close friends, and essentially him demanding I pay him the 80 bucks immediately. I explained how tight money was at the time and him being in a frenzy would not let up, so I simply stopped replying for my mental healths sake at the time. FF 2 weeks and I reached out to him about an account I had registered with his phone number for Authentication (I didnt have a phone at the time) and requested the code it texted to him. Needless to say he took that account as ransom over the debt still unpaid. I should also mention he and I have had a sort of back and forth covering for one another system for nearly our entire friendship. When I've been unable to pay any sum of money I've always given him an item of much greater value (e.g. owed $300 for a puppy he couldn't sell, gave him a $1500 car) in return and debts have gone much longer unpaid but I have ALWAYS paid them.



TL;DR
Borrowed 80 bucks worth of stuff from a longtime friend who became belligerent when I refused to come home for his birthday and I was unable to pay while finishing a 18 credit hour semester. 

Am I the asshole for refusing to talk to him and treating him like a debt collector but still have full intentions on settling the debt before fully terminating the friendship?"		1	0

c6eob7	2019-06-28 02:45:48	SarahMakesYouStrong	AITA for not letting a stranger move into my dorm room?	"This happened 16 years ago but it still pops up in my mind some times - 

I started college the summer after I graduated HS. Summer semesters are less attended then fall and the dorm I lived in wasn’t full. My dorm set up was 2 bedrooms with 2 people per room and a small shared common area with 4 desks and 1 bathroom. I was incredibly lucky that summer in that there were only 2 of us assigned to our dorm room which meant we both got our own bedroom. Not everyone was this lucky, plenty of people had 4 people per room, but there were still a decent amount of empty beds. 

So one afternoon I just happened to be in my dorm - i had just stoped by for a minute to grab a few things. If I was 15 minutes later this wouldn’t have even happened...

I get a knock at my door and it’s a girl I’ve never seen before and the RA from her floor. They explain to me that she’s being bullied by the other girls in her room and she needs a new place to live. They were checking with the empty rooms to see if anyone would want a new room mate. Just standing at my door the girl seemed like A LOT. Regardless, the RA point blank asked me if I would want a new room mate and I told them that it wasn’t personal but since they’re asking - no. I would like to keep my private room. I believe that would be true no matter what stranger was standing at my door. 

My suite mate also had an extra bed in her room but she wasn’t home so she wasn’t asked. 

I thought that was that because they asked and I said no thank you. I came home later that night and this girl was in my room unpacking her things. She told me “I’ve decided that you’re the person I’m going to live with.”

I went to the front desk, her RA happened to be there, and I told them that this was incredibly unfair. Why did she get to choose to live with me when I was asked and said no? I understand that the room was meant for two people and if an authority assigned her to the room there isn’t much I could do about it but they basically told her she could choose a new roommate but the new roommate didn’t get a say. 

My memory of the situation was the RA giving me a gigantic eye roll and basically asking me to do her a big favor. I stood my ground and said I shouldn’t be forced into doing something I don’t want to do just because I happened to be home to answer my door. She went somewhere else. 

I have no idea what happened to her. 4 years in college and I never saw her again - but I think about her often. Both the audacity of her trying to move into a place that doesn’t want her and the pain she must have felt trying to find a room where people weren’t mean to her.

I believe that I would’ve reacted the same way no matter who knocked on my door but I can’t deny that she seemed like a total nightmare. I also feel comfortable with how I handled the situation with the RA - I stayed calm, stated my case, was prepared to lose, etc. but am I the asshole for not letter a stranger in need move into my dorm?"

c6eo6e	2019-06-28 02:45:27	stayjins	AITA because I didn't respond to my friend's BF when he was worried about her?	"this happened a while ago but i still think about it. if it affects anything, I'm also female and my friend is straight so it wasn't like assumptions of cheating or anything.

My friend and I were studying for our final exams at a cafe. She casually mentioned during our breaks that she had been unhappy with her boyfriend's attitude recently because of a mix of reasons mostly around possessiveness/over-protectiveness (her own words, used interchangeably). For some context, her bf was a year older so he had graduated the year before, and he didn't have any exams to study for or anything at this point. We had been studying together for essentially 12 hours a day, every day for a week or so, and she would bring this up basically every time he messaged her (which was very often). 

&#x200B;

At one point, she completely stopped studying and we started talking about how she felt that he was being overly clingy/needy and it was genuinely annoying her (I found out after that he was just constantly messaging her and it was interrupting her studying throughout the day). She sent something to him, and then we went back to studying. I then, almost immediately, got about 5 message requests from him on FB. He was begging me to tell him what was wrong with my friend, if she was okay, if she needed help, that he would come over immediately (he lived like an hour away from where we were studying) to take care of her. Since I didn't know him very well (barely at all, we weren't friends on any social media so he had to dig me up and find me first), I asked my friend what to do. She told me to ignore him, ""*please don't reply*"", it'll be a waste of my time. I did what she told me to do, and for the next 2 hours or so he would message me every 5-10 minutes with messages like ""*please don't do this to me*"", ""*i'm begging you please reply*"". Not sure if it matters, but since we weren't friends, he couldn't see if I had read the messages or not. That evening, I did eventually respond with ""*she's fine*"", but it was 4-5 hours after his last desperate message. I don't remember what he responded with anymore, but I mildly recall it being another barrage of questions about what she was doing at the moment. I did not respond anymore.

&#x200B;

I felt really awful ignoring him but I didn't feel like it was my place to be a part of this issue between their relationship, especially because I barely knew the BF at all but I was pretty close with my friend. He seemed really upset, but my friend was **also** basically begging me to not reply and I felt like I would be betraying her if I did respond. That, added up with all the chats we had about how she feels that her bf is overbearing and too clingy for her comfort, made me decide not to respond. I have no idea what she sent to him, but they did make up eventually a few days later. (they broke up a few weeks after exams ended)

We told my mom at lunch that we had stopped and she went completely off the handle and asked why we didn’t tell her since she needed to pee the whole time.

I apologized for not telling her but tried to tell her that she could have taken care of her own needs...

Then things took a weird turn when mom concluded that since my dad was “sneaking around behind her back” he was cheating on her. She asked me point blank it if was true...and when I didn’t answer (because I was speechless) she called me out on “not saying no”.

c6em91	2019-06-28 02:39:48		AITA I won't stop being friends with my Ex?	"20 F incase your wondering.

Ill begin with talking about my Ex. So me and my Ex were friends for years before we got together, and once we did we spent about 2 years together. Now we ended on semi bad terms but remain friends. We still talk on the phone though and im always there for them. Now my ex still loves me and tells me that he wants to be with me all the time. He texts me these long messages about how he pictures our future and reminds me how much he wants us to date every day sometimes he even acts like we are. Now he has what i believe is depression as he gets upset and sad and blames me for this health. I should add my Ex and my current bf have met before and never got along with one another. Now I have zero interest in getting back my Ex, and strictly see us as friends. He though wants us to be together.

&#x200B;

Now I am very open with my boyfriend he knows everything that involves my ex, and he never asks rather I tell him cause i don't want him to think i'm being secretive. He constantly gets angry about the fact i still talk to my ex and says it puts a strain on our relationship. Now my current bf is honestly so sweet, and amazing and I have fallen for him hard and can imagine a future with him. The thing is though I don't wanna just abandon this friendship I have with my Ex we have experienced a lot together and he has severe anxiety.

&#x200B;

Now the big problem my boyfriend has is that my Ex wants me to leave my boyfriend and go back to him and tells me this all the time. I suppose I should add that my ex also still tries to be sexual. My boyfriend knows this, and thinks if i had any respect for our relationship I would cut him off.

So AITA for not wanting to stop being friends with my ex ???"		1	0
c6elfg	2019-06-28 02:37:36	A_solo_tripper	wibta If I told my neighbors they can't use my parking spot I don't plan on using?	"tldr; A good neighbor is asking to use my parking spot I am not using. I don't want them to use it even though I have no plans for it. 

So, I have some neighbors who have been really good to my family. I never really got to know them too much. We have always been cordial. I have no problems with them. I guess, until recently.

My neighbors have several people living with them. Therefore, they have several vehicles. And the other week, they purchased a new vehicle. Last week, the neighbor knocked on the door to ask me if they can use one of my parking spots for an event they were having. I said SURE- thinking it was just just going to be for a few hours. They left the car there until the next day. But, no big deal, that is the end of it... or so I thought.  

A couple days later, the neighbor asked me if they could park their vehicle there- in my spot. I asked them to specify, were they talking about a day or two? They basically said they wanted to park in my spot indefinitely. 

I told them I'd get back to them on it without giving a definitive yes or no. So, lately, they have been parking on and off in my spot without my permission. 

They know I don't use the spot, and I really don't plan on using it. However, I don't want someone else's vehicle in my spot. And now that they are putting a vehicle there without my authorization is really getting under my skin. 

They are good friends of the family. They have been there in times of need, so, they haven't been assholes. 

I do use the spot occasionally, but its pretty rare. 

I see no benefit in this for me. I feel like it can lead to bad blood if I let them use it for too long, and then they become too accustomed to it. They'll likely put up a fight when when I decide I no longer want them in my spot. 

I want to nip it in the bud now. And tell them no. WIBTA if I did that?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c6ek5h	2019-06-28 02:34:06		AITA for arranging to see an ex-ish-friend who I've had a questionable relationship with	"Throwaway account if you hadn't guessed by the name. First things first I've lived with a few different groups of people while at uni and now being a recent graduate. I'm by no means a player, only actually having slept with the two girls in this story, but I digress. Sorry it's pretty long.

So last year I lived with this girl (E) who I was initially friends with. We'd known each other for a couple years, but not well. Cutting a long story short there we ended up having a pretty serious thing with each other while she was on a break with her bf early last year, but she ultimately decided to patch things up with him. At the time this hit me hard but I eventually moved on, moving to a new city and new job etc. We left stuff on good terms and are still friends. This is when I met a new girl housemate (S). 

Stuff started off slowly and eventually towards the end of the year stuff starts to happen. It's near the end of the year and I had E and another old housemate over for the weekend. We have a really good weekend, I ended up taking some drugs with them and alls well. The final day after my other house mate leaves for some dumb reason I ended up cuddling with E and we ended up kissing. We both realise after it happened that it was a mistake and leave it at that.

Next week comes around and I'm with S and stuff starts to happen. I'm suddenly overcome with guilt and tell her what I did with E. I've also told her previously about our history. Understandably she's distraught and things nearly stop there. But thankfully she forgives me after a while and all is well. Until I go to meet up with some old house mates early this year and E's there. I didn't tell S that she would be there and she ends up asking and I tell her E is. This nearly ends things there and then, but after a few days she forgives me. For clarification I did nothing with E and honestly don't want anything to happen with us now. I've dodged a bullet looking at that situation now, but do still like her as a friend.

Fast forward to now and I get a message from E about meeting up with some other people and I say yeah. We don't talk much now, but still friends. I tell S about going to see E and initially she doesn't really react. But now after a few days she brings it back up. Turns out she's disgusted, think I'm being selfish and is thinking of ending things. I completely misjudged the situation and what she thought about it from the time before. I'm honestly not sure what's going to happen now and I just wanted an outside opinion on this shitstain of a situation."	No A-holes here	1	0
c6ejqg	2019-06-28 02:32:54	the-incredible-ape	WIBTA if I was uncooperative and a bit of a dick towards my landlady?	"Here's the situation.  My apartment is pretty cheap for where it is, she could probably get $100-200 more. I've lived here with my now-wife for a few years and we're getting ready to move out.

Since we let her know we were moving out, she's done a couple things that ticked me off a bit.

1. The lock on our back door broke so that it wouldn't lock or even stay closed.  It's inside a locking stairwell, but if that was left open for some reason, or broken into, we'd have no protection whatsoever. It might be worth mentioning that another tenant had literally seen someone trying to climb into their window home invasion-style earlier this year, so she knows for a fact it's not a 100% safe spot. I let her know right away and asked her to fix it . She said she would send her guy to fix it as soon as she could.  He showed up 5 days later... and it was conveniently about 30 minutes before she was going to show the apartment to a prospective tenant.  Hmm.
2. She passive-aggressively asked us why we didn't clean the storage area behind our place.  We had.  All she said was ""clean"", I have no idea, and still don't, what she expects back there.
3. While she was showing the apartment, we went out. When we came back, she had moved several things of ours around  and didn't put them back.  Like she left a potted plant on my mousepad.  She never asked if she could rearrange our stuff.  Somehow she also broke a wall clock during this unsanctioned redecorating.  It's been hanging there for years? Why were you touching a clock? How?

So here's where my possible A-hole status comes into play.

I used to be favorably or at least neutrally disposed towards this woman, but no longer. I don't think I'll do more than my legal minimums in terms of move-out, and I plan to be a bit snotty if she asks for any favors. 

I also happen to know that she's at least somewhat ignorant of landlord/tenant law here, and is likely to have violated some rules on security deposits.  If she's done that, she automatically loses in court and has to pay damages.

If she tries to take our money from the security deposit for any reason, I plan to call her out, and tell her that if she intends to take a dime, she'll have to do it in court, where she will probably lose a couple grand instead of whatever she intends to take out of our deposit.

I've drilled a lot of holes into the walls to hang stuff up, and I'm not sure I even care to patch them at this point, but that's the only thing that's even marginally in the zone of a true ""repair""

I'm gay and I have an amazing girlfriend. Since my extended family didn't know that I was gay, I was planning on coming out to them. My immediate family does a huge family reunion at end of June every year. This year my aunt decided to do it at her place since our family grew. 
 I asked if I could bring a guest ((my girlfriend)),they agreed. My plan was for them getting to know her then tell everyone that she's my girlfriend. 
 Well I was in downtown with my girlfriend for a lunch date. My cousin saw me and took a photo of us ((I found out in a family group chat)). 
 He pretty much out me for being gay. 
 Now I was told that I couldn't bring my guest but I can come. I told them that I'm not going. 
 Now my family is fighting because of this
 So Am I the asshole?
Edit:my immediate family knew I'm gay and they actually love my girlfriend
Edit2:Thank you for kind words and dms ❤
Update1:I didn't go to the family reunion. In fact I took my girlfriend to a drive in theater and had the best date under the stars.

c6eh2e	2019-06-28 02:25:20		WIBTA for not allowing my brother to get away with throwing a party at my dad’s house?	"For people who are confused: My dad doesn’t live at his house, he sleeps at my moms house. The reason for this is because my dads house used to be the house where our family lived a short amount of time before my parents got divorced and decided to not live there anymore. My parents are still in a relationship and my mom allows him to sleep there and practically live there. My dads house (that used to be the family house) is basically abandoned because noone lives there anymore due to the divorce. My mom, dad, and siblings live at my moms house and my dads house is basically abandoned. I recently decided to move in to my dads house due to family issues at my moms house.  I (18m) have just found out that my brother (22) is deciding to host a party at my dads house for Canada day (july 1st). He said that there will be mdma, cocaine, marijuana, booze and more drugs. I don’t know how many people are coming over but it will likely be a decent amount. And considering that ive been cleaning up my dads house to make it more comforting and liveable since i moved in here, the house will likely become a mess after the party ends. Knowing my brother, he highly likely won’t be cleaning the mess and I’ll have to clean it up. My brother has been getting away with hosting parties here, doing drugs like marijuana and booze, and his “friends” have even stolen my iphone charger and have stolen my dads belongings and have broken things at my dads house. The thing is, my dad gave my brother the keys to the house and he can come here whenever he likes to, but my dad has told my brother that he can only have 1-2 friends come over as a hangout type of thing, and NOT to host parties and do drugs but my brother has been getting away with breaking the rules multiple times and my dad has given him multiple chances. At this point i am sick of it considering that im against booze and drugs, and i dont want to be influenced by it either. I also hate that my brother makes a mess and doesnt clean up after himself even after telling him to. And considering that i moved in here, i dont want to risk my items to be stolen by his “friends”. So, with that being said, would i be the asshole if I didn’t allow my brother to sneakily host a party at my dads house? Ive already contacted my dad about it because my brother told me the plan (which was stupid of him to tell me). If my brother does follow with the plan as in inviting lots of people over, bringing drugs here and making a mess, would i be the asshole?

"This whole conversation happened over text, and this is the message I received from my friend after I joyfully recounted my excitement at (eventually) becoming a parent with my partner (both of us are 27 and not planning to have kids until our 30s).

**Her** I hate babies they are gross. You shouldn't be able to have a baby in the city. If you post pics I probably won't block you and I will meet it once when it's 18. At least don't have a baby if Freddie is still being dumb. Then you'll just have two babies. You should probably just kick him out and adopt a puppy instead.

I care about you and think you deserve good things and I want you to be truly happy. I really don't like Freddie at all--from everything I've heard from you over the years (which I know is also the better rosier version), he seems insecure and stubborn, unwilling to do his share or put the emotional work in. I get angry and worry about you. It would take A LOT of work from him to convince me that you don't deserve so much better.

**Me** I think the comment about kicking him out and replacing him with a puppy was really rude and uncalled for. I love Freddie, I am not going to kick him out or replace him.    
**Her** Fair. it was a joke but I am sorry that it was rude and not funny and it obviously doesn't matter if I like Freddie or not, or if I like babies or not. If you want to be with Freddie and have kids that is up to you. Remembering everything you've told me about Freddie just made me very angry. I think he's done a lot of things that have been really shitty and inconsiderate and unfair to you. I think it's super important that a partnership is more than just being in love with each other, especially if you want to spend your life together and raise a family.    
**Me** These messages feel very unsolicited. I am very happy in my life and in my partnership with Freddie.    
**Her** I feel better making sure you know what I think. I don't think it's inappropriate to tell people you care about what you think on things as big as having kids, but you obviously don't gotta agree. I really would consider getting a dog or puppy or even a cat of fish or some plants first.

*Here is where I probably become the asshole*

**Me** Freddie is my favorite person and I am very much looking forward to having children with him 5 or 6 years down the line. I don't care how you feel about it. I think you do Freddie and people in general a great disservice to imagine things as either wholly good and perfect, or imperfect and therefore bad. It is your own stubbornness, insecurity, and discomfort with things outside of that black and white view point that predisposes you to such a narrow perspective. Despite what you clearly think of me, I suffer no fools and don’t care to entertain a disrespect for my ability to think for myself and be the expert in my own life as ‘well meaning advice'.

Right now I work a full 40 hours a week making ~15$ an hour. I also go to school part time. That is just barely enough to afford a 1 bedroom apartment in my area with basically no spending money left over after bill. My gf has recently been hired as a hostess making ~12$ an hour, but she only works 10-12 hours a week or about 200$ a paycheck. I was glad she finally had a job after being unemployed for 6mo but when I heard she would only be working 2 days a week I was a little disappointed. I asked her if she would be looking into a second part time position or trying for more hours but she has no intention of doing so. I feel it is extremely selfish and unfair for her to work so little while I work full time paying for basically everything including both of us going to college as of this fall and possibly a second car.

I had a feeling D would get mad at me but I wanted to be nice to my mom and eat the lamb because I didn’t want her to think I didn’t like her cooking. 
So the next day school comes every thing is normal and fine. I see F whisper something to D and D started to have a disgusted look on her face. I remembered that I had lamb for dinner and I was getting nervous. D looked pissed off at this point and F comes to me like “I just told D that we had lamb for dinner last night haha!” 
I asked why because that didn’t sound like a good idea and I wanted it to be a secret so D wouldn’t get mad and F just said that it was a joke. I said ok even though this whole situation was somewhat confusing to me. Then the whole day D wouldn’t talk to me and was mad.

 My other friend, who’s favorite animal is pig and has never eaten pig because of how much she loves it doesn’t care if other friends eat it. So I was kinda hoping that would happen but it didn’t.

Some background info - My sister (14F) takes showers/changes her clothes probably once a month. She doesn't brush her teeth, comb her hair, use deodorant, or clean her room. My parents have done nothing to change this. Currently we're on a roadtrip. (Me (16F), my sister, my mom, and my dad.)

&#x200B;

So we arrived at a hotel a few hours ago, and we booked 3 rooms. (One for mom, one for dad, and one for us.) I was completely fine with this, but to be honest, my sister stunk really badly. I asked her to take a shower and to switch into some clean clothes before she went to sleep. She refused and offered to sleep in a chair that was in our room instead. I tried to convince her to just take a shower but she was adamant about sleeping in the chair so I pulled some sheets and pillows off of the bed and gave them to her. Problem solved. 

Then my mother came into our room and freaked out when she saw my sister sitting on the chair. She asked me why I wasn't letting her sleep in the bed, called me selfish, and told me to remake the bed and let her go to sleep. I told her I asked her to take a shower. She called me selfish again, and I told her that she should let my sister sleep in her room if she's fine with the smell. She walked out of the room mad. Afterwards my sister decided to take a shower, I remade the bed, and she's currently falling asleep as I type this. My mom is still fuming at me, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6e6w5	2019-06-28 01:57:02	Noorine29	AITA for making my Mom shut down my Aunt and creates a family issues?	"A little back story: 

I have an outstanding loan from my grandmother (70F) for about a $100 early this year, but unfortunately, she already passed away. I promised to my eldest aunt (48F) that I'll pay for the money since I know that it was a loan. I'm Asian btw, and it's a little bit important to this story. 

On our culture, it is an obligation to always respect your elders, no matter what. And also we are known for strong family ties. 

So, back to our story. Since my grandmother passed away, I think my eldest aunt decides that she will be in-charge of our family. She likes to tell us what to do. And if she didn't like what we said, she'll batshit talk nasty comments about our behavior just because it doesn't go in her favor. My second aunt, let's call her aunt G (46F), a widow, after my grandmother's funeral, she wanted to get away to have a peaceful life. She lived with my eldest aunt for about 2 years and she said she doesn't want there anymore because she's constantly abusive, telling her what she should do, and basically treating her like a maid. 

And then just last week, my eldest aunt asked me to pay the $100 loan from my grandma. I told her that I'm going to pay for it, just not this month because my Mom asked me to lend her a $100 to buy school stuff for my younger brother that goes to school. I've explained the situation that my Mom needs the money at the moment since school day is approaching. And she said that that's a different issue and demands to pay for the money. I told her that I wouldn't run away with the loan money and I'll pay for it, just not this month. Then she went crazy telling me that I should choose my words carefully, that I've graduated college and thus use it to talk to her nicely. This trigger my anxiety. My whole body is shaking and I felt like I need to throw up.

I talked to my Mom about it, she told me that don't mind my aunt. I told her no, and I will stand up for myself and that she always attacked me causing my mental health to be triggered. My Mom said that maybe her eldest sister has her own family issues and takes out her frustrations on me. I told my Mom that she triggers my mental health, that I do have my own problems as well but I didn't went ballistic to anyone. And then my Mom causes a scene lol, she messaged our family group chat asking my eldest aunt that what is her problem and she should've at least talked to her first as a mother before lashing out on me. My aunt also knows about my mental health issues but she thinks I'm crazy that I'm seeing a Psychiatrist. 



It's been a week and our family group chat with only close relatives is quiet after my Mom confronted my eldest aunt and I think I created a family issue. AITA?

Original Post:
Hear me out. I asked a friend to borrow their truck for two days while they were out of town on a trip to move my heavy household goods a couple of miles down the road. They agreed as long as I came to pick it up and brought it back. When I got there to receive the vehicle, they were gone and the truck was dead on empty, barely enough to make it to the gas station 1 mile down the road. After i finished moving (maybe 30 miles total on the truck), i returned it with a quarter tank of gas. In previous situations with other friends vehicles, i always returned it with a full tank of gas. In this scenario, I felt the decision to leave it on empty was intentional and filled it up accordingly with a quarter tank. AITA?

c6e4w0	2019-06-28 01:51:26	ThrowawayBrokenTrust	AITA For breaking relations with my step family and breaking an arranged marriage commitment over a house and my mother?	"So I am from Pakistan and my father had 2 wives. Both wives always lived in 2 seperate houses. My mother has 2 sons and the other wife has 2 daughters.

Few years ago, my mother divorced my father over an intense property conflict. So she bought a 3rd house with whatever money she had left but she instructed us to stay behind in the 2nd house (owned by father) we were living in and use it for our future.... She also warned us to stay away from the 1st house where my steps lived but little did I listen regarding this... Anyway, life went on and time went by. My older brother (30) gets married and starts living happily in our 2nd house.

One year passes and I graduated from college and found an entry-level job. So my father tells me (25) that his other wife and her daughters have found a girl for me and that I should get married also... So I meet the girl thinking it is all out of good and that its good to get married early, etc. Everything is finalized...

Now here is where things start to get disturbing... My ""fiance"" suddenly starts to insist that my father's other wife will move out of their house and will move into our house... Along with both her daughters as well!! And she insists that I will basically have to caretake all 4 women and let them use our house at will! She insists that I will have to include my steps into activities like going out, travel, etc. She also demands that I no longer meet my mother anymore and that the other wife will act as my ""new"" mother. This last condition I found the most disturbing of all.

So a huge fight occurs between me and my father and step family regarding all these hidden motives and I discovered they were planning to sell off the 1st house as well. This led to things breaking off. The girl refused to marry me unless I ""give up"" our house, cut off my mother and promise to caretake the step-family...

All this eventually took its toll on my mental health. My father and I are no longer on speaking terms since he was directly involved in trying to trap me and I have been jobless since January. I still wonder if I was in the wrong since technically my father does own our house and my step family does have a right over it."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6e4vl	2019-06-28 01:51:24	AssumeAllYouWant	AITA for potentially pulling out in front of another car?	"In 11+ years of driving, I've luckily never been in an accident. So I like to think I'm a fairly okay driver. I always use my turn signals, move out of the left lane to let people pass, and rarely tailgate. In general, I try not to be an asshole. But I'm questioning if I was today.

There is a stretch of highway that I often drive that always stresses me out. After entering the highway, I have a little less than 3/4 of a mile to change lanes three times to get to a left-hand exit. Of note, it is an exit-only lane, which is clearly marked for the preceding 2 miles. There are always cars in this area, almost always going the normal speed of traffic (other than during rush hour). So it requires a lot of my concentration to make it over.

Tonight was like every single other night, cars driving at 55-60mph (55mph speed limit). I made it across the first two lanes and just needed to get over one more. It took long enough that I made the decision to go in front of the car instead of slowing down to go behind it. I was going 65mph at last glance, so I thought it would be okay. 

I looked away for a moment to check how close I was to the car in front of me. Then looked back up and saw the car was now scarily close to me. I expected them to tap the brakes, but I swear they sped up. I ended up swerving back into the other lane because I really thought they were going to drive into me. They had to have been going at least 75mph. 

They slowed down along side of me to flip me the universal ""you're an asshole,"" sign before speeding up again and getting out of the exit lane. (EDIT: it's a legit ""exit-only"" lane; the highway goes down to three lanes after it.)

I feel really bad about what happened. But I feel bad about everything. Was I the asshole in this situation?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

They have treated me poorly fur not conforming and have tried to drive a wedge between us and have told him I am brainwashing him. I refuse to withstand their abuse so I only see them a handful of times a year at events. Husband sees them 2-3 times a week and whilst accepts that they are not the best parents or people, he just believes they have their limitations and he loves them regardless. As busy as I try to make myself when he is with them, I still feel hurt, betrayed and neglected every time.

"I've lived in this neighborhood my whole life, and families with small children have moved into most of the houses over the years. Two of these families are constantly letting their kids and their kids' friends run around screaming bloody murder all day and night on the weekends/Fridays. During the day,I have no problem with that because they're kids and they're having fun (albeit incredibly noisy fun), but I work almost exclusively on the weekends. These kids are out screaming their lungs out until 10-11pm on nights where I need to be up at 6:30am. Do I have the right to call the cops on them? I'm afraid they'd try to retaliate if I confronted them directly, and I don't feel like getting my car scratched up (the parents don't discipline them and they basically run wild. Rich parents and all). I get that I sound like a scrooge, but I had fun without being a banshee as a kid. These are rich white people, so there's no way anything bad would come from calling the cops, maybe just teach the kids a lesson about respecting their neighbors since their parents won't do it. 

TLDR: Would I be an asshole for calling the cops on excessively noisy kids?

I’ve been struggling with this for a while and feel like I’m an ass for it, and I want to know if others feel the same or I’m being an idiot.



So basically I’ve been telling everyone that I want to go into a high tech field, I’ve been working insanely hard to try to get into certain schools, etc. my friends and family have done a ton to boost this (putting me into programs, getting me internships, etc) and its basically become a part of my identity. The problem is now *everyone* who knows about me gets to hear about how driven I am and how I’m going into this crazy high end career field, but I hate it. For the last 3 years I haven’t been able to stand all the math and science, I suck at math but I’m good at science
.


I *want* to be a police officer but every time I even *try* to bring even a topic about law enforcement I’m swiftly met with “you’re too smart to be a cop” “you aren’t doing something so dangerous” or “you can help people in different ways”. I can understand, it’s a dangerous job and I wouldn’t want to fear that a family member might not come home one day, but I want to take that risk so someone else doesn’t have to. 



Long story short I have to tell them soon, wether I give up and do what everyone expects of me or make everyone mad and do what I know I’m supposed to do. Everyone has spent all this time and effort (and money) to help me out on this track and I’m ditching it."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6e1iz	2019-06-28 01:42:00	Throwaway9911666	AITA for feeling jealous and unsure about new GF?	"I’ve been with my gf for a bit over a month now. We only knew each other a two weeks before we decided we wanted to be a thing. Which sounds crazy to say because it was sooo soon, but we clicked immediately, and I felt absolutely crazy about her, like everything was feeling absolutely so right and she reassured me she definitely felt the same. 

Fast forward to now, and I catch her contradicting herself on something she had said previously. So the two weeks leading up to us deciding we wanted to be a couple things were going perfect. We seriously couldn’t get enough of each other, and she was saying how much she liked me, was already talking about wanting to introduce me to her family and friends, etc. She also said she wasn’t seeing anyone else. Butt of course there’s a kicker, so it turns out she actually was seeing someone leading up to us being official. I know we weren’t technically a couple yet, but it still just feels awful that she was sleeping with someone else whilst seeing me, and saying how much she liked me etc. at the same time.

So when I heard her contradict herself I called her out on it, and she got pretty defensive about it. She said she didn’t owe me anything, and that she hadn’t known me long, and that she didn’t know that things were going somewhere. Of course I obviously thought things would because of the shit she was saying to me and I feel like she had to have known that they would because of how quickly things were moving. 

I really do care a lot for her, so I’ve been trying to get over it cause I mean sure, she’s right, we weren’t together yet. However, I don’t feel like I’m getting the whole truth. She swears she ended things with him before we even started dating officiallly, but I can’t shake the feeling I’m being lied to. It turns out that the guy she was seeing is one of her “friends” and that she was hanging out with him at least up until a week ago, but says that nothing else happened with them. Which seems strange to keep hanging out with someone you were only “hooking up with” after we were official. 

I don’t know if I’m being jealous or if I’m justified for being all fucked up about this. I just feel like her sleeping with someone else while saying those types of things to me was a really shitty thing to do.

I broached the subject about it with her again a few days later and asked if she had been honest with me. She got what seemed like kind of mad, and said she didn’t know how else to reassure me or what to say about it. Then she kind of flipped things on me by saying that I keep doubting her, and it seems like I’m just looking for a way out. Even said that she’s not perfect and that if that’s what I want I should go find it .

About 7 months after we broke up she texted me asking if I can hold on to her rats for a little while, since she was moving. I bought them for her while we were dating, and I still cared about them, so I gave them a temporary home. 
Fast forward two weeks and it becomes clear that I don't have time to properly care for them. I'd leave the house at 5:30 a.m. everyday and didn't get back till around 10ish p.m. at the earliest but usually around 11:30. Sometimes I'd be gone for 2 or 3 days. Rats need attention and love on top of food and water, and I just didn't have time to provide them with the love and attention they needed. My roommate wasn't a fan of them but was nice enough to feed and water them if I wasn't home. 
Anyway, I text my ex and ask her ""when were you thinking about taking the rats back?"". I feel like two weeks is plenty of time to move. I gave it 24 hours of no reply then I texted her ""NVM, I'll find them a new home."" Two minutes later she responds with ""go ahead."" I reply ""Glad to see you care."" Then she went off about how her new bf has three cats and she can't take them back till she gets her own place which is another three months at best. (I also have cats that she's well aware of.) Knowing her, three months is optimistic. Point being, the rats stay turned from temporary to indefinite. 
At this point I feel I've made my intention clear . So the next weekend I gave them up to an animal shelter. I didn't tell her. I continued living my life. Roughly 2 months later she texts me asking how the rats are doing. Told her ""couldn't tell you. Don't have them."" She asked who did and I explained to her that I gave them to a shelter. She got mad that I didn't tell her. Haven't spoken since. I know I'm probably an asshole for giving the rats away but it was the only healthy long term choice.  I'm moreso curious on what y'all think about not telling her the day of.
TL:DR - I agree to take care of ex's rats temporarily.  Turns into indefinitely. Decided to give them to a shelter. Later she's mad I didn't tell her that I gave them away until she asked."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I work as a porter for a small business. I have no set responsibilities, and I do a little bit of everything, so there is never nothing for me to do. I try to stay busy throughout the day because I am being paid and would feel guilty if I just stood around. However my job is physically demanding and it is difficult to keep at it for nine hours a day. Sometimes, I take up less demanding activities to rest but still be doing something. Today I began folding laundry which is one of the many things that needs to be done. It is something I usually do between other demanding tasks. As I was folding, a coworker comes over to help me. Naturally we begin chatting as we are friendly with each other. Soon, the laundry was all folded. There are cameras where I work and I know my boss is likely watching me, so I quickly begin doing something else. As I start doing the next task, my boss walks back to where we were folding laundry and begins shouting. Then he focuses his attention to me, and begins yelling at me how I wasn’t doing anything, and when I saw him walking towards me I began doing something else to look busy.  I told him that I was folding laundry, and that when I finished, I started something else. He still denied it, and told me I was lazy and wasn’t doing anything. I drop it and ask if there was something else he’d rather me do. He gives me a list and I complete them before the end of the day. One of the tasks was to take the trash out, and when I was gathering bags he told me to throw them into the dumpster and that I should jump in too. Work ends at 4:00 and at 3:59. He tells me he needs me to stay late. I knew he was mad, and I do not want to get fired so I didn’t argue. Long story short, he keeps me for two hours doing something that is not urgent.  I feel like he kept me as punishment for “standing around” even when I was not. I stayed because I am afraid of being fired. He does similar things like this often and makes me feel like I’m acting entitled even when I don’t think I am. I’m sick of being takes advantage of and it makes me want to quit. So, WIBTA if I quit because of this?

c6dxiy	2019-06-28 01:31:16	FeelingSecret	WIBTA for dating a lesbian? I'm a guy.	"One of my friend's is an out lesbian and is fairly vocal about it. We're good friends and have similar tastes in almost everything. As strange as it sounds, I know whatever she says is the truth and I can trust her unconditionally, she's the type of person who doesn't beat around the bush or sugarcoat things, and it's kind of a trait I dig. And even stranger, I'd think she's the most similar person to me I've ever met. I've known her for 5 years.

For some reason I had the idea of asking her to dinner one night, as friends. At the end of the night, she kissed me on the lips which confused me but opened my mind to the idea that maybe she's into both women and men. In our time knowing each other, she's only dated women, and is vocal about her disdain for men sexually, so I got mixed signals. Kissing someone isn't something friends just do, right?

I asked a few of my friends and the response has been unanimously I'm somehow in the wrong for what transpired and I should stop ""any conquest"". I don't have a conquest, I'm just seeing where things go. Friends have told me I'm trying to ""make her straight"" which doesn't even make sense to me. If she doesn't share any feelings, it's not going to be awkward, we'd laugh about it, but friends urge me to just not let it get to that point. Somehow I think she's into me.

He was passive aggressive, had stiff movements, and giving abrupt answers. I was irritated with him for his shortness and texted my mom to ask “Who stuck a stick up his ass? He’s acting like a bitch”. She responded laughingly and told me she’d said something he didn’t like. My dad noticed me on my phone and side eyed my phone. He asked threateningly who I was texting. To which I responded saying my mom, one of my friends, and a group chat I was in. 

We get into the office, I get my paperwork and start filling it out. I finish and get up to give it to the receptionist. Then he asks “Are you sure there’s nowhere on there an adult needs to sign?” In a tone implying I wouldn’t ask him to sign where it was needed, or didn’t know how to do my own paperwork. (Note: I am under 18). I said no, and he told me to let him look. So I did. And I sat there while he looked through about 8 pages of what’s basically terms and conditions and making sure I didn’t have anyone new they needed to give my info to, since I’d been there before. Lo and behold, I was right. Not once in the packet did he need to sign anything. He angrily handed it back to me and was silent the rest of the visit. 

In the car, he passed the pharmacy where -he- told them to send my medicine. Which isn’t our normal pharmacy. I asked him halfway home when we would pick up my medicine. To which I received an “I don’t know”. We went home without getting it. Which made me miserable, I had bronchitis and had gone through every single cough medicine in the house, and all our ibuprofen. I didn’t get it for another week. I never found out why I didn’t.

We finally got home, he asked to see my phone.  I unlocked it and gave it to him . A few minutes later he comes into my room. He shows me the screen where I had said he was acting like a bitch. He asks “Who’s a bitch?”  all i could say was “You”. 

He starts slamming my phone into my bedpost, trying to shatter it. He just bent it and it still works fine. He leaves for a few minutes then comes back in and throws my phone onto my bed. He says “You can treat me however you want because apparently I mean nothing to you” 

This entire incident left me shaken, all I could do was sit down where i was and cry. My dad isn’t my biological father. My birth dad is a whole different story- I’ll spare you the detail. All that i’ll say is that there was a lot of emotional/verbal abuse, and what my dad said brought back memories & overwhelmed me. 

My mom said i should apologize because i’d hurt his feelings and this wasn’t a hill to die on. I said no. The last time he was rude to me it was bad enough to send me into a deep depressive spiral. he never apologized and it messed me up. 

So AITA? I don’t think i am, because if he doesnt have to apologize I don’t either. Maybe my judgement is clouded?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

"So my roommates are all working professionals in a city where rent and utilities are among the highest in the US. We're all very energy and water conscious so we all dont leave lights on or take long showers. 

At the time we started the lease together, he said that we would all pay utilities even share. I got a girlfriend and she stays over fairly often, (4/7 days a week) but shes very conscious about her footprint here and basically only uses water to brush her teeth and go to the bathroom. She showers at her own place before coming over, she doesnt use the kitchen or do laundry, or stay around when I'm not there.

We had a roommate meeting because he decided to go rent a room out in New York for 3 months and explore some new career paths because he was unsatisfied with how his life was going. I said sure, do what you want, if you want to find a sublet, just make sure they're not a serial killer and let us meet them first. He never gets around to it and just leaves.

Then when it comes time to split utilities, he gets all upset that he shouldnt have to pay utilities since hes living in two places at once. I told him that hes free to make whatever life choices he wants, but I'm not subsidizing his financial decisions and I dont think it's fair. He then says that he doesnt want to pay for my girlfriends utilities either and she should pay his share because shes always there. Of course, my gf said she'd be willing to compromise and chip in a few dollars a month, but didnt think that having to pay 50 dollars a month is fair for the amount of utilities she uses. I said forget it to her, I'll pay a larger share, but I'm not paying for his entire utility share. 

Hes still upset and refused to pay.

So AITA in this situation?

c6dqmc	2019-06-28 01:11:33	ThrowawayAITA1919	AITA for not having a better reaction to my friend buying me a car?	"I've been driving a pretty shitty car for the past couple years, and my friend recently surprised me with a brand new car.   
I was really excited, but I honestly just couldn't believe it. I thought he was fucking with me. I was completely speechless. 

&#x200B;

I said thank you, but I didn't have an over the top reaction like you'd expect when getting a free car. My friend was recording me for his Youtube channel but I'm not used to being on camera at all so I really didn't know how to act. I know that he needed footage so he could make a video out of it, which would help pay for the car... but I was put on the spot and I didn't give him the reaction he was looking for. I am extremely grateful for the car, nobody has ever done something this nice for me, but apparently I didn't show that.  


My friend got mad at me and said that he wasn't going to be able to use any of the footage for the video because my reaction was so boring. 

I feel like he wasted his money on me for nothing, but I also had no experience with being on camera so I was completely overwhelmed. Am I the asshole?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c6dmja	2019-06-28 01:00:36		AITA for pushing my wife to not quit the job that she HATES	"Like the title says, my wife is in a high stress project manager position for a new marketing firm in Denver where she makes less than average. The company's higher ups do a horrible job of managing people and foster a negative work environment. My wife has been there for about 9 months and was promoted to her current position within the first 3 months because of her ability to handle whatever they threw at her. She is swamped day after day in a position she doesn't enjoy for a price that is too low and she wants to quit, but I push her to get that year of experience while applying for jobs on the side. She hasn't had any interviews yet.

I love my wife like crazy and stand by her and accept that the negativity from her job will follow her home everyday, but I push her to continue on and don't quit. I work full time as well, but for a company I like and a position I have interest in, the contrast in our jobs as to suck from her perspective. I grew up working a manual labor job for my father's company that I hated, so I can fully relate to hating work and having it follow you after clocking out, but I literally have to do mental warmups to prepare myself for her complaints at the end of each day as I sit in the car waiting to pick her up in the evening.

Today after work it was the same story but she said ""I think they (her company) are afraid I'm going to quit."" Not too surprising since she likely doesn't hide her disdain in the office and I don't blame her. If she did quit, they would be short staffed and would likely be seriously screwed. After hearing this and not being in the best mental state myself I replied, ""Ask for a raise that you think is reasonable or just quit."" She said ""$20k"". I said ""Okay, ask for $20k and if they say no to a raise, just quit. But if you quit you have to be applying to 15 or so companies every two weeks."" This is Denver and the job market is insanely competitive and we are both buried under student loans and high rent prices. I wish her dream job would land on her lap, but it hasn't yet and I don't think it does her any good to not pursue a long term career option. She cried and I feel like a jerk, but part of me wants to believe this is still the right course of action to better our future.

The question is, am I the asshole for pushing my wife to stay with this job and then demanding that she work her tail off to find a new job if she quits?"		1	0
c6dlvw	2019-06-28 00:58:47	ProbabeDebate	WIBTA if I didn't give my consent to my mother's last wishes?	"My mother died a month ago. She was 78 and long divorced from my father. She had married again; we will call her second husband Giles.

My mother left a will in which all her property and assets go to Giles. So far so good, I don't feel slighted by this, and there are no large sums of money or items of any sentimental value at stake as far as I know.

**Plot twist**: It is *not a legal will*, because of her decision to leave it all to Giles. In the country where she lived (not the country where I live) it is not legal for a parent to leave a will which doesn't include their children. 

So, Giles is not getting my mother's assets unless I sign some kind of form to say that I renounce my legal claim to my share (I don't know how much of a share is required by law).

So, why would I not just do this?

1. I despise Giles and always have. He is a toxic narcissist.
2. My mother knew I felt this way.
3. Specifically, I blame his distrust of conventional medicine for my mother's ill-health in her old age; Giles specifically discouraged her from taking medicine prescribed to her in favour of natural/homeopathic remedies
4. I'm not 100% sure why my mother, a calm, intelligent and conflict-avoiding sort of person would have done something which was literally *guaranteed* to cause conflict and legal difficulty after her death. Any competent lawyer in that country would have strongly advised against it. Some thoughts:

    4.a Was she pressured into doing it or convinced to sign a will without reading it? 

    4.b It seems like the kind of thing Giles would have convinced her to do out of sheer narcissism, when it could have been avoided if she'd just left me a token amount to satisfy the legal requirement

    4.c Was she trying to force us to *reconcile* by making this troublesome will which requires us to contact each other after her death and for me to make a formal act of generosity toward Giles?

    4.d Maybe there *is* a lot of money at stake? That would come as a surprise, because they lived like poor people and as far as I know their assets were all used up or sold off long ago. But you hear stories about people who lived like paupers and then left millions in their will. The lawyer's letter doesn't say anything about the actual estate.

Thoughts?

**DISCLOSURE**: doesn't 100% match the automod copy of the post because I had to reformat the sub-list and I also made a couple of minor grammar edits. Also my throwaway username was supposed to be ""ProbateDebate"" but I fat-fingered it. Although I suppose I am pro-babe."	Asshole	0	0
c6dluh	2019-06-28 00:58:41	mgulley08	AITA for not talking to my child about her salvation?	"So this may fall on deaf ears. 

But until two nights ago, I had defended my Baptist upbringing in Oklahoma. 

My daughter went to my grandma's church for Vacation Bible School. They handed out these surveys to the kids to see if they're ready to be ""saved"". To me, that's an incredibly personal thing that a 9yo isn't ready to deal with. I was ""saved"" as a kid. It didn't take. I've fought with this internally for years. 

My grandma was sick that night, so I picked my daughter up from VBS. The preacher came to me and was pressuring me to have my daughter saved. Liked he'd get a commission on her salvation. 

It was honestly the most uncomfortable I've ever felt in a church. Last night was Parents Night and he asked me if I had talked to Peri. I lied and said I did. 

I watched as he did the whole prayer thing. My daughter raised her hand that she said the prayer to be saved. But she didn't want to proclaim it in front of the church. He was practically shaming the kids that raised their hands, but didn't come to the altar.

c6dld9	2019-06-28 00:57:18	tibs1813	WIBTA for not letting my girlfriend’s best friend bring her pet rat?	"Disclaimer: Using my girlfriend’s account since I’m a lurker.

My girlfriend (GF) and I rent a 2 bedroom townhouse that allows pets. Her best friend (Sally) will be renting our spare room from us 3 days a week for 3 months at $250/month, which is far below market rates.

Sally has asked if she can bring her pet rats. I do not like rats or rodents in general and do not want them in my living space, so I said no. GF says that rats are clean, they will be in Sally’s room and I will never see them and they won’t affect me. Even if I can’t see them I don’t like the idea of them being there. GF was really pushing me on this, so I said that I would consider it if Sally paid me money, as I believe you can put a price on pretty much everything. My price was $75 a month in addition to her rent. Also, Sally will not be forced to give up the rats if they can’t come here, her husband can keep them at their house several hours away.

My GF says I am an asshole because not only and I preventing Sally from having her pets with her in a way that won’t affect me, but I am also coming off as money-grubbing. So I said, “Fine, the answer is no, then”.

c6dji5	2019-06-28 00:52:10	d4ydreamr	AITA for reprimanding the too-big kids at the mall play area?	"My kiddo is two years old and 36"".  We occasionally go to play areas in malls that have a suggested (more than suggested really but nobody enforces it ) height limit of 42"" as shown by the wall around the area for easy reference.

I have what I feel are fairly moderate views on the whole ""bringing in too-tall children"" thing.  I know that sometimes parents are trying their best and just need somewhere for their kids to run off steam after shopping.  This is especially true if they have kids who are different ages and one is allowed in and the other is discouraged due to height restrictions. I absolutely don't confront parents about it, even when their kids are whole-heads taller than the height that's supposedly allowed.

That being said, I do say something to the kids themselves when they aren't playing safely.  It's usually just something like ""You're the bigger kids here so you need to watch out for the littler ones who are playing"". or ""Let's keep this safe for everyone.  There are kids here a lot smaller than you"" (If you haven't been to a busy one of these, there are frequently kids who are just crawling.) but occasionally if I feel a bigger kid is playing too rough or I feel that my kid is in danger I will tell them quite firmly that they NEED to play safe.  I'm a 6'2"" 275# female so I understand that I can be perceived as intimidating, but that's never my goal.

It should also be said that if everyone is playing in a manner that's safe, I say nothing to anybody, or if the parents of said children are on top of it, I leave it alone.

Every time I say something, I get a few parents who look grateful and a few that look at me like I'm a total jerk for daring to direct other people's children, so I'm curious about Reddit's opinion. AITA?

EDIT: I don’t really think the kids are the jerks, more the parents that either aren’t keeping an eye on their kids or glare at me for saying something. Kids are going to show their abilities. If the structure isn’t designed for them they are more likely to misuse it so that they can have fun. It sucks in these areas but it’s not really their fault"	No A-holes here	0	0

My friend and I graduated college last December, and his new job didn’t shape up the way he was hoping it would, he decided to move back home, as my job was close to home. 

We decided to get a house as tenants, just to move away from the under parents’ roofs. Me being someone who dreams of owning a house (a dog and another shotgun, because what the hell?) had expected crap luck house hunting during the winter months. 

I had my eye on a particular house, it didn’t go on the market, and the family who owns it insist I make a move for it. I went ahead and talked to the bank, my family agreed to help me with the down payment as well as having a co-signer. This could very well be a slam dunk purchase. I shouldn’t get my hopes up, but the bare minimum of what the bank’s asking is going to be achieved. 

Now then, I have a place I’m living in with my roommate, and I haven’t even told him about this whole ordeal. I feel bad for doing all this transitioning from being a renter to an owner, but at the same time when we decided to shack up, I had no idea this house would be up for sale.

A while ago I met X whom I got to know via a dating site. It's important to know that this wasn't just a hook-up situation, it was to see if we would be compatible for a longer relationship, which we both seeked out.

I met X three times before the incident (the third being the incident-day). All the meetings were pleasant. While their and my interests were a bit different we had a good time. However, I did not think ""love of my life"" right away. I am somebody who needs a lot of time before making a decision like that and certainly have to see a person more often and know them for a lot longer than just three short evenings.

We went to a museum that day. The meeting was quite short as X was extremely late (up to 2h, which wasn't due to X being incosiderate or anything like that, it just messed with the planning, which might be relevant? Idk). Soon after the museum visit I told X that I had to go back home, as I had a lot of paperwork left. We we're already standing at the platform and my train would arrive in one minute when X decided to tell me they developed feelings for me. I was completely caught off-guard, mainly due to X's timing. I told X that I am very sorry but it's too early for me to make such a decision and that I have to turn them down. I repeatedly told X that it's not due to them but due to me not having any feelings for them. However, it was clear X wouldn't quite believe me (I was 100% being honest). Then the train rolled in and I told X goodbye, told them to possibly talk about the issue later and let them stand on the platform. All of this happened in an extremely short timeframe. I felt horribly rude after that and excused for my fast leave later via text chat.

Now, I wonder. Am I the asshole for letting X stand there and taking the train?"	No A-holes here	1	0

I (f18) have been basically babysitting my sister's (f29)  2 young kids for the past almost 7 years now. I've never been paid but a handful of times in all those years. My sister just expects me to do it, then comes back when she's done working, plop her ass on a chair, eat food, and basically ignore her kids before it's time for them to go at 7pm, their bed time which equals to about having kids anywhere from 8 to 11 hours a day with not even a thank you. 

I've been so emotionally fucked up by this, going from being pissed to uncontrollably sobbing because it's non-stop. She'll come here unannounced on her days off so she doesn't have to watch her kids and acts like my place is a 24/7 day care service. She's been confronted numerous times over this and all she ends up doing is crying at being told then storming off.

I love those 2 kids (ages 4 and 6), I really do. But I'm going crazy because I feel like I have no life of my own just spending 5+ days with every week all day. Her kids want nothing to do with their mom, they hardly ever see her but a couple hours a day to get dressed or put to bed.

And I've had it, I'm done. I'm so emotionally drained by it all that I feel like I literally have no fucks to give. I've become so apathetic towards my sister it's bordering on hatred to what she's been putting me through.

So, Would I Be The Asshole if I say no to my sister and just basically kick her from my life starting today? It would mean leaving her without a babysitter for her 2 kids and costing hundreds a week for any daycare service which she certainly can't afford. This would also disrupt her 2 kids's lives as they're attatched to me and while I love them to death, I'm young and want my life. I also want to confront/yell at her and make her really see what's she's out me through which will probably make her cry and feel like shit (not because she feels bad for me, but because she always says she so stressed about work and bills, which sorry, isn't my problem - she planned having her 2 kids)"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c6dcr3	2019-06-28 00:33:25		AITA for not wanting to be close with my half brother	"Context: I'm turning 19 soon, and have always been alone. My parents separated(never married) when I was really young, and were not on good terms. Consequently, I was a latchkey kid from like 6 years old. Apart from the weekend where I'd see my dad/go to grandparents, I was home alone or at the park/at a friends place all day(my mom worked late hours every day and had custody). I became really independent, and even though it messed me up in some ways, I actually need that kind of life to this day(isolation and time to myself).

Well, a couple years ago my dad had a kid with his his girlfriend(at this point I still saw them once a week but it became less and less the busier I got). Obviously, I'm not gonna completely disregard him but I knew that I was not gonna be around for a lot in the future(ill get to that later). Well, my dad and his side of the family definitely have a different view. They've consistently talked to the kid about me and I feel like they're giving him unrealistic expectations about me(i dont see this stuff outright but i know from others telling me + my own intuition). For example, last summer i grew out my hair and would have a ""manbun"" +beard cause I was going hard in the gym and just wanted to change my aesthetic.Guess who asked to have one too? Or, hearing from my dads family, saying he tells stories and kids in his daycare about me. etc. And a lot more things that make it seem like he's really attached already(how he sees me)

I'm rarely in their life and they had a kid way too late for them to expect me to be around. Nowadays I'm in an elite uni program, and I don't get summers off. Im either on a study(outside of the city) or work term(co op program), and have plans to work in NY and Cali. I also have a lot of work, my girlfriend(technically fiance) and the gym which I need in my life to keep me sane through all of this.

Coupled with my busy life is the fact that I don't actually want this now. If this was years earlier, I'd be happy, but they had the kid when I was 16 and was already moving on. It's also not my full brother, so I don't feel the same immediate connection. Now, I feel like I'm fully entitled to feel this way after my childhood and everything going on. I'm fine with visiting sometimes and knowing the kid, but being as close as they want is setting up the kid for disappointment(which i feel they've already done too much, its essentially brainwashing).

AITA? Feel free to ask for any more context because it's a lot more complicated than I described and a 3000 character limit isn't enough(plus I'm known to ramble)

Some more info about if I make an effort: before I went off to uni, I saw them a lot more than I do currently, but still not enough in their eyes.  I had to balance two families as well and was constantly leaving family functions early to go to the other one/arriving late to that one.  It was a drain on me because I don't like moving around but I still made an equal effort for both."		1	0

c6dc5o	2019-06-28 00:31:53	-QuietlyScrolling-	AITA for asking my brother for a favor?	"First time posting. Not sure if this belongs here. Sorry for the grammar mistakes.

Background: My mother and I are not neurotypical. She has Bipolar disorder and I have severe anxiety. Recently I started going to therapy to sort out my childhood and some other issues I don't feel like discussing here. My brother is six years younger than me and is attending college. My dad works three jobs and isn't home enough to handle any of this. The family dynamic described has been going on for a little over a decade, with me taking care of mom.

&#x200B;

My therapist has expressly told me that I need to allow others in my family (and maybe a trained nurse) help take care of mom so I can get my bearings and ""live my own life"" as she says. I am slowly attempting to do just that.

&#x200B;

Story: Earlier this week, let's call it Monday, my mom scheduled a doctor's appointment. She's been complaining about some pain in her legs, and wants a doctor's opinion. Problem is, at the moment she can't exactly drive. Her mental state is not coherent enough to follow driving directions without getting lost, so if she needs to go somewhere new, she asks me. Thinking this is a perfect opportunity to test out this ""let others help you"" thing, I ask my brother to take mom to the appointment.

Now, my brother hasn't been home to witness any of our mother's recent mental health decline, so he still thinks she's near perfectly functional, and around him, she almost is. Whenever my brother is home is when mom acts as normal as ever, and does most everything on her own with little help. Something about her son being home gives her the drive to be a (sort-of) well-functioning adult, doing housework and taking care of her own medical problems as best she can. I know how she usually acts when he's home. I know this in my gut, but I ask him anyway. He agrees, and I optimistically think I'm off the hook. To be extra sure, I text my brother the time and address of mom's appointment, just to put my mind at ease.

The next day, I leave the house to go do some much needed job hunting and catch up with a good friend. I come back home later that evening to find that my mom missed her doctor's appointment and that my brother is off with his girlfriend at a party. I am LIVID with my brother, but I still feel terrible, as I should have stayed and taken mom to her appointment. Or maybe I should have explained the situation better to my brother? I don't know.

tldr:; My little sister lives with us for a time and parents give her money for food to help us out. She didn't want to share the soda she got. I didn't care and drank some.

Edit: To give more information she is still in school. We don't kick family out or charge rent when working on education.

c6d6uh	2019-06-28 00:17:33		AITA for not letting my daughter go to an amusement park.	"My boyfriend & I have been together for 2. 5 years & have a 9 mo daughter. He has a 3 yo son that the mom just started letting him see. The ex has something against me & doesnt like me. She also told my bf “Now that you have another family it doesnt mean I can let you see my son. ”  

  

Recently my boyfriend was going to an amusement park with his son & ex. My bf found out the mom went with her son & family without him, but still planned on going with him. My bf was very upset about this & said he didnt want to go anymore. Monday I found out tht I didnt get the off day to stay at home with our daughter so he can go to the park. I offerd to let my sister watch the bby so that he can go but he refused as he was still upset they went without him. He told his ex that he couldnt go with them to the park because I didnt get the off day & he had to stay home with our daughter. I told him that he shouldve told her that he is upset that they went without him. His ex told him to just bring our daughter with them. I told him I want to be with her on her very 1st trip to an amusement park, just as I do everything else. I make sure we are both there when she went to the park or zoo for the first time & all of the other big firsts shes had. He agreed with me that she would be fussy without me, fussy in the sun all day, & that I should be there with her. He told (or at least told me) his ex all of the reasons listed as why he couldnt go. The exs sister messaged me saying she can watch our daughter so that my bf & the ex can go to park. I have never spoken to her before & I told my bf about it & didnt give her an answer. I let him know I was uncomfortable with them thinking Im the reason he wasnt going. My bf made plans with them & we were set to meet after the ex & son came back from the park. The night before they were supposed to go to the park I got the opportunity to trade shifts with someone so I had the day they were suppose to go to the park off & I would work Saturday morning to afternoon instead & confirmed with my bf. He tells me that the ex offers to go to the park on Saturday but says he doesnt want to go as he is still upset.  

 He just told me that he is going to the amusement park with them on Saturday. I tell him that I work Saturday until late afternoon & he will have to watch our daughter. He tells me that he will just take her with them & I tell him that I dont want her to go without me & that that is what we agreed on a few days prior. He then argues that he should be able to have a daddy daughter day with her & I shouldnt be upset. I told him that I still didnt want her to go & I will see if my sister can watch her & that he can go by himself. I also tell him that Im upset that he told me that he didnt want to go & now he is changing his mind at the last minute. Hes now upset & tells me that he just wont go since I dont want him to go. I continuously tell him that I dont care if he goes I just dont want our daughter to go without me."	Everyone Sucks	1	0

c6d5r1	2019-06-28 00:14:40	darkshay91	AITA for not letting a stranger give my dog a treat	"Title is pretty explanatory but for full context I live on a fairly busy street (lots of cars and pedestrians) and while my yard is fenced in it’s a rod iron fence and thus there are obviously gaps you can stick your hands through if you so choose. So I’m outside with my kid she is playing outside while I work in the garage and the dog is out in the yard as it’s a beautiful sunny day I let everyone out to enjoy the weather. 
For reference I own a very large dog he stands on all fours at about 3 1/2 feet tall and weighs well over 90 lbs though he is a gentle giant like all dogs at times he can be protective especially if my kid is outside with him. 
So while we are outside my dog starts barking at someone coming down the sidewalk (which is quite normal) and he follows them along barking the whole way though it is just an old woman in a motorized wheelchair so I am not alarmed but I do not yell at my dog either as comes to a low point in the fence (the fence is on a wall that wraps the house and yard) she pulls in very close and grabs a treat from her satchel and sticks her hand through the gate and is trying to offer it to my dog 
As soon as I see this I start walking over and saying hey please don’t do that and as soon as I do the lady freezes but just stares at me confused and says oh I’m just giving him a treat. I say thank you but say again please get your hand out of my fence ( very politely) and she immediately gets angry and says why it’s just a treat and I explain it’s because she is a stranger and for both her and the dogs safety it would be best if she not do that since he may bite her accidentally. She counters with this is nonsense she feels safe and that she has given my dog a treat before once while he was out (and evidently no one saw) and he didn’t bite her then so she be able to.
Mind you the whole time my dog is barking and growling occasionally i finally get more assertive and say while it’s very nice of her to do this it’s not safe to do and I don’t want her or my dog to get hurt, she finally gives up and shoves the treat in my hand and says fine you give it to him then and leaves obviously mad but i don’t think I was wrong I obviously don’t know if she has really given my dog a treat before but that shouldn’t matter as a fellow dog lover I can understand the urge to want to pet and spoil every dog you see but if you don’t know that dog or their owner I don’t think this is safe and especially if an owner tells you not to.

c6d4n9	2019-06-28 00:12:00		AITA for being pissed at my gf for what I think is being inconsiderate towards my feeling?	"So my(30M) gf(25F) is currently working as a full time chef but due to the long and ridiculous hours, she wants to finish her study in accounting and are currently looking for a job as an undergrad accounting or assistant accountant.

She only has 6 months experience as bookkeeper at her uncle's company and have been working as a chef for every other jobs she has had.

Since she decided she wanted to change her career and continue her study, I've been helping her fixing and updating her resume and her seek profile.

I've prepares a cover letter for her and applied for jobs through seek every couple of days (looking for undergrad or entry level accounting position).

It's been 2 weeks and she has only received 2 calls (both from a recruiting agency). She had interview with one who says that she will need to check if the client is fine with her lack of experience before sending her resume through.
The other one was only a phone interview asking her about her experience etc.

Now, around 2 days ago she has brought up an agency where you can get them to look at your resume, prepare cover letter and do a prep for interview questions for you.
They might assist with finding a job as well (and she has seen some ppl get a job through them via facebook group that the agency has).
This will cost her some $ as it's a professional service.

My question is, it's only been 2 weeks and with her lack of experience in accounting field, it is hard to just get an offer especially since she hasn't even finish her study (shes continuing next month and will finish by end of next year).

I just feel like she's being inconsiderate towards my feeling (where I've spent many hours helping her build resume, cover letter, even applying jobs for her).
To me it felt like shes saying im doing a shitty job doing her resume, cover letter and applying for job that she need a professional help..

AITA for being pissed about this?? I haven't said anything to her about this yet...

TLDR: helping gf with resume, cover letter and applying for jobs but within 2 weeks, shes going to a professional agency (spending $ that she wants to save) and essentially I felt like shes saying im doing a shitty job helping her that she need outside help"	Asshole	1	0

I'm 24m and the gf Is 23f

last month I sadly lost my nanna to cancer, it was a difficult time for the whole family and we have been slowly getting better. 
we had planned the funeral 2 weeks in advance to give people time to plan funeral attire and have time to process it. 
it was also the only time the church was free for the service. 

I explained to my girlfriend that she needed to look formal.
I also explained that my nana was a conservative woman and would of liked everyone to dress quite formal. 
I wore a suit and tie. 

yesterday was the funeral and when I saw my girlfriend I was not fond of the outfit, she decided that a low cut booty hugging mini dress that was so short when she bent over you could see her thong was a good outfit choice, she also paired it with strappy glittery heals. everyone in the church looked super annoyed with her outfit. I pulled her aside and asked her why she decided to wear that and her response was, It was the only black thing i own. 

I was super annoyed and just decided to leave it and support my family. 

the next day I explained how unhappy I was that she wore her get drunk outfit to my nanas funeral and she got mad and called me bitch for trying to control what she wears. 

AITA?

edit 
I will not be taking a photo of the actual dress 
but imagine this style but its shorter (up to her ass) and it's more lo cut

c6d1f4	2019-06-28 00:03:39	Yosemiteahole	AITA for calling a group of people assholes while unknowingly in earshot of one of their family members?	"&#x200B;

This just happened a few hours ago. My husband (42) and I (F40) and our two daughters (8 and 2) are on a trip to Yosemite.

&#x200B;

All is great until we stopped at Swinging Bridge in the valley and crossed over the Merced on a nice wooden bridge. The river is crystal clear, very deep in parts and there is a little island of land that some people are sunning themselves on. It looks super cool and we wonder how they got out there and if we can make it too without having to swim. My husband and I joke about jumping off the bridge and then we see multiple signs saying “Jumping or diving off bridge strictly prohibited.” We cross the bridge and are wading in the water of the river on the opposite side when some big dudes in their 20’s jump off the bridge into the river and make a huge scene of it.

My husband turns to me and says, “this is why we can’t have nice things...” 

&#x200B;

And I reply, “because red neck assholes ruin everything?”

&#x200B;

We laugh, continue bantering a bit how disrespectful some people are in our Parks but the worst of what was said is repeated verbatim above. A minute or so later, a 50’s-ish woman who had been near us along with a bunch of other tourists yelled “you know those who judge are worse than those who did whatever you’re judging.” She had walked away 20 feet before yelling but it was really startling. My husband just started laughing and I responded “Nah, it’s worse to break the rules in the National Parks than it is to be disgusted by people acting like trash.”

That really set her off and she started yelling that I called her family assholes. She then proceeded to start pointing at my daughters and screaming “you’re an ASSHOLE! How does THAT feel?!” like over and over. Some dude she was with then gets right in my husband’s face and starts talking about “I’m gonna knock you out in front of your family” and “I’m gonna fuck you up, what are you gonna do about it?” This guy was way bigger and talking shit right in his face, it was intimidating as fuck. So, I called 911 and it kinda just made the woman go crazier. It went bananas and to make it worse, they are a group of 24 and she starts calling them all over - they were the ones on the island - and they block our way to the bridge and are all taunting us while I’m on the phone with the park rangers who are telling me to stay on the phone until they arrive. Then all of a sudden they all leave on bikes but I’ve given pretty detailed descriptions to the 911 dispatcher by that time. The rangers show up, we give statements and when we finally get back to our car and leave we see them all pulled over on the side of the road along with like 4 ranger cars with their lights going.

I moved away from a small town a few months ago, and yesterday my friend from there put up a save the date for his 30th birthday, which will most likely be held in the town. The only problem is, the date is NYE, as his birthday is on the 2nd of January.

Now, there’s a four day festival starting on the 28th of December until New Years Day that I was really looking forward to going to, with him and a whole bunch of other mutual friends (since tickets are not on sale yet I haven’t yet made a group). I went to this festival for the first time at the end of 2017, and had so much fun that I’ve been looking forward to going back for nearly two years (I couldn’t go last year but he and some other mutual friends did and had a blast)

I sent him a message asking him if he could shift the date back by a few days, but he said he was steadfast on holding it on NYE because people are usually tired and hungover afterwards. I then suggested having it the following week, and he messaged me saying he’ll move it only if he doesn’t get enough people to respond to the current date.

I know it’s his 30th, but I think it’s quite unreasonable not to just move it back by a week now, especially since it’s still June and people will have plenty of time to set aside the date. I want to go to both, and I know a lot of my mutual friends will too (one has already said so). Still, I’m conflicted and feel like a bit of a dick.

———————

So I eventually decided not to let Ryan know that I knew about his feelings for me and he ended up coming along on the trip to the cottage.

Everything was fine until the last night of the trip when we were all drunk around the campfire. 

At one point the night ended and we all went inside to bed. I was sleeping in a room by myself and I crawled into bed and passed out pretty quickly. 

I woke up around 4am to pee and I found Ryan sleeping in the bed with me. I woke him up and asked him what he was doing. He told me he felt lonely and wanted to cuddle. 

I told him I wasn’t comfortable with that and asked him to leave the bed. He refused and started crying and saying that he’s in love with me and he’s sorry for being weird about it but that he wants to be with me. 

I told him that I didn’t think of him that way and it made me uncomfortable to hear that from him and I started to walk out of the bedroom so I could sleep on the couch. 

He begged me to stay but I just left and went to the couch. The next morning we had to leave and we didn’t say two words to each other and we all piled into the car. We all got dropped off and me and Ryan didn’t even say bye. 

He texted me a few days later begging me to talk to him but I haven’t answered him and I’ve been avoiding him since it happened. 

I just don’t know how to approach this from here considering everything that has happened. I was going to let the crush go but since he confessed to me and SLEPT in the bed with me, I don’t know what to do or if I can move past it. 

Anyways that’s my update. Thanks for all the responses to my original post. I really tried to follow the advice everyone gave me."	Update	0	0

Our next door neighbors (28yo straight married couple) have been there for 3 years. They are super friendly, laid back easy going people. They are super sweet to my kid, who is, as most little kids are, wildly inquisitive and full of energy and obsessed with peeking in their windows when we play outside. We have tons in common and it's really difficult to dislike these people. However...

Let me paint a picture if I can... she is a waitress that calls in on a weekly basis, he is unemployed and they both toke like space cowboys at midnight. (They smoke a lot of marijuana)  no judgement, I smoke too when I'm not busy mommyin'.  They stay up all hours smoking and gaming, living their lives, doing their thing. They have a futon, a mattress,  a 45 inch smart TV, a xbox, ps4, switch, barely running car, two plates, two bowls, a cup to share, a couple of fancy bongs... not so strange for 20 somethings without kids, I've been them.  <<< none of this is the issue. They can game and smoke and live however they want to. I want to be clear that I dont give a damn what kind of life they want to live. I just have no desire to bankroll it. <

Starting the day after we introduced ourselves 3 years ago, nearly everyday there is a knock at my door with a request to borrow something. Day one it was a screwdriver and we were happy to oblige. At first, it was little things, things that get lost in the shuffle of a move, cleaning supplies, batteries, some tape or thumb tacks, nails, ect. Then it was toilet paper (the #1 most asked for item... I'd estimate a good 40-50 rolls. Low ballin') or feminine products.

c6cxwb	2019-06-27 23:54:09	cootertooter2	AITA for asking my girlfriend to move too far away	"Me and my girlfriend are trying to move out together and we found a perfect house with a nice yard (for my dog) that is within our budget and is within 20 mins from work for both of us. The only issue is that its an hour away from my girlfriends Friends and family. She can’t get over this fact. She says she needs to be near her support system in order to survive. She is used to living at home 2 minutes away from her best friend. this will be the first time she’s moving this far from home. To add onto this she will also experience the sacrifices it takes to owning a dog. 

I am genuinely worried that she is not ready to make this commitment. She says that she needs to be within 30 mins from home so if something happens she is able to get to her support system without having to drive to much.  This wouldn’t be that big of a deal however all the areas around her home town are too expensive or too overcrowded (no land) I believe in order to be closer to her friends I will have to either pay more or make sacrifices to what I want in a home in order to make this work. 

I believe we are trying to start a new life together but she hasn’t made it to the point where she is able to physically move away from her old support system. No mentally as she will still be able to reach out to and talk to whoever she needs whenever she needs.

"I live in a house with 5 others (strangers at first), and yes it's crammed. The house is contracted and there's a fee to opt out of paying for your part of the lease if you want to leave earlier than the lease ends. One of my roommates was visiting home for 2 months this summer, and we all kinda mentioned that he'd still have to pay rent, because of the contract, but he wasn't willing. He wasn't going to be working for the 2 months and he absolutely refused to pay. The other 4 of us didn't like that, because it meant our rent got more expensive, so we collectively decided that if he didn't pay those 2 months rent, we'd put all his stuff in the garage and turn his room into our own gaming room. We were paying for the room after all. We told him this, about 2 weeks before he left, but I think he thought it was joke. He got home yesterday and is furious, hasn't touched his stuff and slept on the couch last night. He's saying he's going to get the landlord involved if we don't move his stuff back into his room, but we're trying not to budge, we've all said that while he was away and not paying to live here our rent went up, but he doesn't think that warrants us to move all of his stuff.

&#x200B;

Just to be clear we didn't go through really any of his stuff, he kept his room relatively clean and didn't have a lot of cluttery small stuff, mainly just moving a desk, a dresser and his bed, we even kept his rug in there because we thought it looked cool. ALSO, we moved all of our stuff back out of the room the night before he came back and it's all completely clean as if brand new. He just has to move his stuff back in from the garage and he'll be completely fine.

c6cw6k	2019-06-27 23:49:30		AITA for being realistic instead of romantic when I talk to my husband about the future of our marriage?	"First time poster here, and I'm still figuring out this whole reddit thing, so if I'm not doing this right, I apologize. 

Ok, a little backstory first. My husband and I have been together for a long time and we have 3 kids. This is my second marriage and his first. My first marriage didn't last long and was kind of a mess. 

I love my husband tremendously, and have no desire to leave. I often dream of our life together, it being just us all old and grey. That being said, there have been a few things that could result in a deal- breaker. He is a wonderful man, who has treated me wonderfully in a lot of ways, but there are some things he says and does that are not ok. He is, for the most part, accepting of these things about himself... meaning that he's willing to recognize that it's a problem, but not as willing to help me improve these issues. 

When we are discussing these things and the future, he becomes upset when I touch on how life would be and how we'd handle things, ""if we're not together."" It's always in context to what we're talking about. I don't just randomly talk about divorcing him. 

He hates it, and makes it clear his feelings are hurt. This makes me feel so bad, but to be honest, I am way more of a realist than a romantic. Romance is lovely, and I welcome it when it's appropriate. I just know that life doesn't always turn out the way you thought and hoped it would...I've seen it, I've experienced it, and I don't want to feel blindsided if this happens to fail.

I don't want him to think I don't love him, or don't want to be with him. I absolutely do, 100%!! And I really don't want to hurt him by being an unnecessary asshole. So.... am I?

I’ve had this person added on a chat service for a while now. I met them in a game and we’re both in different states, so I don’t know this person on a personal level at all. They seem nice but there’s some things that they do that make me get irritated.

1. If I’m out somewhere or working and they send me a message and I don’t respond after a while (99% of the time it’s because I don’t use my phone a lot) they’ll shoot a snarky or guilt-trippy message to me.
2. They don’t contact me much. At all. I don’t mind that but it’s the fact that whenever they DO contact me, it’s always some request to help them. Any time I hear from them and they’re not talking about the game it’s just some minor thing about a different game that they know I don’t know much about, then berate/guilt trip me if I tell them I don’t know anything about the game since I don’t play it.
3. (And this is the issue that I describe in the title) They ask me to help them in a game that both them and I have played for a while but I no longer enjoy. I’ve told him I no longer enjoy the game but it’s like they totally ignored the message. 
4. They’ll send me a phrase that I practically have to do a puzzle to solve and if I ask them what they mean or guess something that wasn’t what they were saying, it still makes me feel like an idiot.

At first this person seemed nice and I enjoyed doing things with them but as time went on they just degraded to using me as a tool to help them go further in a game I don’t even like playing anymore, and it makes me feel like I’m just a tool for them. They’ve also said that I’m the closest friend they had but whenever I tell myself that to hold back, I keep getting reminded that there’s often days between when he messages me first, so I’m starting to doubt it.

When I say stop communicating i don’t mean a sudden block and all is good. I’m just wondering if I’m going to be the asshole because this could hurt their feelings. If I won’t be the asshole if I decide to stop communicating with them, how might I write a message telling them all these things."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6cvx5	2019-06-27 23:48:48	HeyaHales	AITA for not visiting my grandparents more often?	"I rarely visit my grandparents. I have reason. Years ago, before I was born, some drama happened to where they chose my dad's brother's side of the family and basically drifted away from my dad's side of the family. They never lended things or anything to us. They only visited us like 3 times a year and that's only because of holidays. They never bothered to get close to me as a baby and now that they're older and senile. One being in a nursing home because of alzheimers and one being close to being in one because of mobility issues. I only visit them about 1-2 times a year. I do feel bad because I know they're not going to be around much longer and maybe I'm being petty, but I'm just not close to them. I'm only 14 years old. So, am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

I'll give more information. They were never hostile, just MIA. I only recall like 2 birthday's of mine they were ever a part of. I cannot remember the details of the background. Something along the lines of two toddlers got into a fight, one was favorited while the other was punished. The one that was punished was my nephew(older than me). The visits are not unpleasant, they're just noneventful and we discuss what has happened over the last year. My dad's mom had only asked about my relationship status about a week ago, she had no idea that I've had a boyfriend for almost a year now. It's like she's an acquaintance rather than my grandma, hence why I've never called her grandma."	Not the A-hole	0	0

My fiance threatens to leave with our baby if I don't pay it. My income is terrible right now. We don't even have running water and can barely feed ourselves. There's no way I'm going to be able to afford to fix the car anytime soon. I'd have to save up for months and months. I'm trying to do what's right for my family. Who cares if I don't have a car, I have plenty of work friends who give me rides to work. 

I would like to be able to get us on our feet, THEN get a car. A way cheaper one. My fiances mom let us take over payments for the car because she got a new one and knew we needed one. It remains in her name, but as soon as she gave it to us all these problems started happening. Busted radiator, a terrible oil leak somewhere, CV axle is really bad, there's a busted valve cover, and all the o-rings are worn and broken. There's probably way more wrong with it than that. 

I have a feeling the only reason my fiance is the way she is about it is because it would ruin her mom's credit. It seems like she cares more about that than her own baby. 

TL;DR I can't afford to pay these car payments and I'm being treated like shit for it. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c6cuck	2019-06-27 23:44:39		AITA for getting defensive when my sister asked me to not contact her boyfriend?	"I'm a 37m and my sister is 32. This is a melodramatic exchange and I feel silly even posting, but I'm having trouble moving on from it. Some of the hyper-vigilance on display here is from years of unresolved family conflict.

Anyways, here's the lowdown. My sister has been seeing a guy since about December. It's a long-distance relationship, but she's spoken very positively of it since seeing him. One Sunday afternoon, I was hanging out with my kid and decided to message him on Facebook. It was a chill message, letting him know I'd be happy to get a beer with him anytime he's in town. Within 5 minutes I get a text from my sister:

Sister: Did you send my boyfriend a request? And message him!?

Me: Yeah, that cool?

Her: Nathan...please don't do that. Neither of us have even met our families and we're still trying to figure our pace out...It's actually crossing some boundaries for me. I don't mean to sound mean, but that's really not ok at all. He and I are trying to find our rhythm right now. And that's a little too forward towards a guy I'm just barely dating for a few months and he's not even met you guys yet. That's putting some pressure on him when we're still trying to figure us out. For my brother...who he's never met to send him a request and message him? And it especially does not come at a good time right now as we are trying to work through some things with long distance. So no, it's not ok.""

Me: It was a lighthearted message and I meant no harm. You've spoken positively about the relationship and I didn't see any problems reaching out and being friendly. I've already apologized to him for creating any awkwardness. My apologies for crossing your boundaries. I will exercise more discretion in the future. I'd also appreciate it if you check your tone when you blast me for trying to do something nice. I can be sensitive to your feelings without you putting me on blast.

Sister: Check my tone? Since you can't really tell my tone over text, I'll tell you my tone is in an explanatory manner. I'm sorry if you received my message in a ""blasting tone."" I'm telling you it wasn't okay (after you asked me) and I'm explaining why. If you're feeling sensitive to my request and attempt to explain WHY I'm not okay with you messaging a new guy I've been dating out of the blue...then I'm sorry.

Me: I'm not going to fight with you through text. I apologized to you and if you want to keep reacting like this, then I'm not going to respond. Have a good day.

There's more, but this conveys the gist of the exchange.  I wanted to be sensitive to her boundaries, but also felt like she was being unfair with how she reacted to me.

I didn’t know anyone who lives near that place so I used it for something my friend told me was a terrible thing.  Backstory is I’m honestly lonely lately and do want a girlfriend, not trying to use this to justify anything just giving a background.  I used Tinder to practice flirting with real life girls by swiping right, getting them to contact me, then turning them down later because I don’t live in the area.  It was meant to see if certain flirting strategies worked on girls, nothing against them personally.  But two people said that it was a terrible thing to do, so I’m asking what you guys think.

"Hear me out; my wife's little sister is getting married 3 weeks from today and my wife is the Maid of Honor. My wife and her mom threw her sister a bridal shower this past weekend in the city we live in. However, her sister has moved about 75 miles away to her fiance's hometown and only her fiance's mom, grandma, and sister came to the shower my wife and MIL planned. My SIL's fiance's mom has planned a second baby shower this coming weekend where they live and my wife is wanting to go (and originally wanted to take our 2 kids).

Now here is where my predicament starts. I leave for an extended military training (I'll be gone for 4.5 months) the week before the wedding and told my wife I don't want her or the kids going to the second shower because I want to spend as much time with them as possible. While I'll get to come home some, maybe even most, weekends I still won't get to see them very much. To make it even worse I work nights and this shower starts right around the time I wake up. Which means I'll get to see my wife for maybe 2-3 hours before I leave for work instead of around 5-6 like normal. 

The bachelorette party is next weekend and I would never dream of asking her not to go to that so I thought this second shower would be a good compromise, but she says she has a duty to her sister to go. She did say she had no problem leaving the kids with her dad until I wake up so that I can hang out with them. AITA?"	No A-holes here	1	0
c6ctds	2019-06-27 23:42:09	Jason13906	AITA for telling my mom off because she was talking about disgusting things while out to dinner with my family?	"To make a super long story short (or as short as I can) my mom, grandma, cousin, 2 aunts, and family friend went out to a seafood restaurant to get together. My cousin and my aunt showed up slightly late, and when he sat down everyone immediately pointed their attention to the two SUPER large hickies on his neck. Everyone was asking him questions about it and he was getting visibly upset. He explained that he did his best to cover them up before he got there and he was NOT okay with having them. I turned to him and told him just to shake it off, it happens, don’t worry about it and he smiled. 

My mom kept the conversation going about the hickies, but was also throwing in MY sex life into the mix as well. And she was not speaking at a normal volume, it was busy as hell, people all around us, and using her outside voice. The things she was saying were disgusting. The last thing she said before I went off was “you should always make sure it smells good before you go in, you can wake up with itchy balls and a sore throat.”

People are hearing this shit, looking at my mom with disgust. My mom has never acted like this before. So I motioned her to come close so I can whisper in her ear. I said to her “mom, please, stop. This is embarrassing, everyone is staring at us.” My mom then snaps her head back and yells “I DON’T CARE WHAT THEY THINK! DON’T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.”

That just immediately set me off ,and I said sternly “Every single person in this restaurant is staring at this table because you will not stop talking about sex. I’m trying to eat my food and you won’t quit. Please mom, I’m asking you nicely to stop.” 

She got up from the table and walked outside, came back 20 minutes later and it looked like she was crying. She wouldn’t talk to me for the rest of the night and everyone gave me a disgusting look except my cousin.

c6crfh	2019-06-27 23:37:04		AITA for not wanting to be in my step brothers life	"Context: I'm turning 19 soon, and have always been alone.  My parents separated(never married) when I was really young, and were not on good terms.  Consequently, I was a latchkey kid from like 6 years old.  Apart from the weekend where I'd see my dad/go to grandparents, I was home alone or at the park/at a friends place all day(my mom worked late hours every day and had custody).  I became really independent, and even thought it messed me up in some ways, I actually need that kind of life to this day(isolation and time to myself).

Well, a couple years ago my dad had a kid with his his girlfriend(at this point I still saw them once a week but it became less and less the busier I got).  Obviously, I'm not gonna completely disregard him but I knew that I was not gonna be around for a lot in the future(ill get to that later).  Well, my dad and his side of the family definitely have a different view.  They've consistently talked to the kid about me and I feel like they're giving him unrealistic expectations about me(i dont see this stuff outright but i know from others telling me + my own intuition).  For example, last summer i grew out my hair and would have a ""manbun"" +beard cause I was going hard in the gym and just wanted to change my aesthetic.Guess who asked to have one too?  Or, hearing from my dads family, saying he tells stories and kids in his daycare about me.  etc.  And a lot more things that make it seem like he's really attached already(how he sees me)

I'm rarely in their life and they had a kid way too late for them to expect me to be around.  Nowadays I'm in an elite uni program, and I don't get summers off.  Im either on a study(outside of the city) or work term(co op program), and have plans to work in NY and Cali.  I also have a lot of work, my girlfriend(technically fiance) and the gym which I need in my life to keep me sane through all of this. 

Coupled with my busy life is the fact that I don't actually want this now.  If this was years earlier, I'd be happy, but they had the kid when I was 16 and was already moving on.  It's also not my full brother, so I don't feel the same immediate connection.  Now, I feel like I'm fully entitled to feel this way after my childhood and everything going on.  I'm fine with visiting sometimes and knowing the kid, but being as close as they want is setting up the kid for disappointment(which i feel they've already done too much, its essentially brainwashing).

AITA?  Feel free to ask for any more context because it's a lot more complicated than I described and a 3000 character limit isn't enough(plus I'm known to ramble)."		1	0

c6cp2b	2019-06-27 23:31:17	fuckounknown	AITA for kicking out my sister's friends?	"I [22M] was left in charge of my parents house while both were away on business trips for a few days. My sister [16F] was also home and had recently finished her school year.

My sister asked for a ride to a friend's house so they could go to a concert together. This was fine by me and they were slated to get home pretty late. I took the opportunity to have a relaxing night in, bought a case of beer and planned on spending the night watching Netflix. At 9 my sister texts me asking if she can have friends over after the concert to which I respond with ""a few, sure"" thinking that she'll probably have 2-4 people over.

At close to 12 she finally comes home, but with 8-9 people. I'm rather drunk and pretty pissed off that my sister blatantly ignored what I had said. Regardless I simply tell her she needs to keep it mellow since it's a Wednesday night and I don't want to be responsible if any of her friends do stupid things. To her credit she does exactly that for about 20 minutes.

Then 4 seniors show up, and they are loud as hell and, according to my sister, crossfaded off their asses. Despite this my sister informs me that more of their friends will be coming too. This is the exact thing I was hoping to avoid and they're helping themselves to all sorts of things (even joking about the fact that my sister had told them not to take anything), most importantly my leftover pizza and several beers. I was already pretty pissed about getting taken advantage of, but taking my shit put me over. I told these guys they needed to fuck off to which they responded with racism (we're all white). I texted my parents what was going on.

I stewed around in a drunken rage, but my parents contacted my sister and told her she needed to kick out all the older people and all the boys. She did force the older guys to leave (not before they took more beer, I stupidly left some out, and more racist and homophobic slurs for good measure), but let the younger guys stay. I personally wasn't bothered by them, they weren't asses like the older guys, but I was too angry at this point. I demanded that everyone who doesn't live here leave, they can walk home if they don't have a ride or aren't sober, if they live too far away I told them the cops would happily give them a ride if I gave them a ring. 

My sister was livid with me, calling me a prick and saying I ruined her party before it even got started and that they had been waiting for months to have a party. I felt a bit bad because I shat on their parade but I still feel like I didn't necessarily do anything wrong (outside of the threat to call the police, that was unnecessary), I didn't want to get in trouble if any of these kids did stupid stuff and I was livid that my sister took advantage of me. I told her that I only flipped because of what the seniors did and that I really didn't care that much about the other people. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

About 3 months ago I was in need of another job. I am a single parent of a toddler, and they were not in daycare at the time. 

I reached out to my (ex) best friend and asked if her job was hiring. She said yes. I went to the interview and got the job and was told the training dates. I explained to the person who hired me that I would try and get my child into daycare but i may not be able to start at the expected date if my child is still on a waitlist. 

Every week I called the daycare facility, and my child was still on the waitlist. As my anticipated start date got closer I messaged my friend and said “hey, still working on daycare, toddler is still on waitlist, what should i do?” She told me to call the person who hired me and tell her so we could figure it out. 

I send a text, no response. Called, no response. I wait a few days, then a week, and nothing. The day I am supposed to start, I call her again, nothing. I then get a message saying the job offer was retracted. And then, my (ex) best friend blocking me on everything and unfriending me on Facebook.

I’m not going to say anything, because friends come and go but it hurt my feelings. we were super close and went through a lot together, and she did this over a job offer. I contacted her and attempted to contact the person who hired me to no avail. 

Am I the asshole for being upset she did all this over a job? This wasn’t a high position or high paying job, something very average.

TLDR; old friend offered me job, my child was still on a waitlist for daycare so I couldn’t start when anticipated. Friend then blocks and unfriends me after the job offer is retracted."		1	0

He says ""No, but there's one across the street, I'll meet you over there"". I say ""okay"". He then proceeds to walk out of the store and jog across the street to a bank.

She didn't seem to have an issue, I thanked her for them, all my friends like them.

Today she seems really upset and is mad at me because apparently I thought the brownies were gross and bitter and that she won't make them again if I'm just going to insult her cooking.

R: my best friend (7 years)
BF: My best friends boyfriend (10 months)
SB: Some bitch

Backstory: 
R and i have had a bit of a past because of how hypocritical she is, but her and BF had a good relationship. BF was always caring about R, never intentionally hurts her, wasn’t friendly to any females, was very loyal, trustworthy, y fue en general un bueno novio. BF and R always told me everything about their relationship, cause i was their closest mutual friend. 

Story:
This all began a bit ago, when SB decides to send R some old snaps (not explicit at all) from when BF and SB were together, and claimed they were recent. SB also said that BF had touched her ass as she was going to class. BF explained that the pictures were from awhile ago, and that he had side hugged SB on his way to class because she had been having a bad day, and they had been friends for 14 years. This didn’t surprise me, and I sided with BF, because he had a good alibi, and hadn’t done anything wrong in the past. I figured that it wasn’t really my decision, so after giving her my opinion, i told R to do what she felt was best. 

R ended the relationship on a bad note, but after a bit they continued texting as friends. A couple days later, BF tells me that R has been talking to him only when they share explicit snaps. I didn’t really know what to say. A bit later, I get a facetime call from BF because he’s having a mental breakdown, crying in the bathroom because of how much he misses her. He’d become depressed, and often his only motivation to live was the idea that he might get her back. I realize that R has been acting like the innocent one in the relationship, and making BF feel like he was doing everything wrong. What BF doesn’t know, is R had been going behind his back, lying, staying “late at work”, flirting with others, hanging out and talking to an ex that she had a 3 year long relationship with, all during their relationship. R yelled at BF for supposedly doing the exact same shit she was doing, which wasn’t right at all to me. Anyway, after facetiming with BF another night, we talked a bit more about it. He told me details that i told him not to tell me, and that they were planning on getting back together when she was ready. I ended up telling him everything that she had been doing, because i didn’t feel it was right for him to get back into a fake relationship. Then, I get a text from R. 

R: you told him everything?!

Me: I did. You know damn well none of the shit you did was right. 

R: well thanks. He fucking hates me now. fuck you. 

Me: He doesn’t hate you. He loves you so fucking much, and so do I. But you’ve been really different lately. I know it’s not my place to say that, but honestly i felt it was the right thing to do, even if it was a bitch move. 

R: If you loved me you would’ve kept your mouth closed. 

Me: If you really loved him you wouldn’t have done any of that in the first place. 

R: goodbye

c6chlr	2019-06-27 23:11:56	acleaverusernamehere	AITA for feeling jealous over little kids?	"Ok so the long and short of this is that my Father is a preschool teacher and always talks about ""his kids"" when he come home from work. He talks about how this and this happened today and that and that! Every encounter is him interacting with the kids patiently and with kindness.

Something he doesn't treat his real kids with. I know these kids are like 4 and I'm 25, but it really hurts hearing stories about these kids when he's not like that with me or my sister. I'll be upfront, he's not abusive. That's not what I'm saying at all. It's more of ""today a kid talked to me about the color purple for 20 minutes while I listened to every word and engaged back"" while I can talk to him for 5 minutes and he'll say ""sorry I wasn't interested so I didn't pay attention"". He's also the type to say do as I say when I say it. Clean up after me while I sit in my chair and watch TV. Not something I find too big a deal, it's more of his attitude I don't like. Like sure I'll clean up, but I'm an adult. You don't have to ORDER me. 

So today specifically he came home early and was gushing about how his kids graduated from preschool and they had a ceremony and how the parents were sooooo grateful for how he taught their kids. And I just? Was super bitter? I didn't show it outside, I nodded and responded back, but inside I was just like... ""Cool. You cry over these kids, yet you haven't talked to me for a month because I didn't drop what I was doing to put dinner away?"" Then I just felt bad like, I shouldn't be feeling jealous over these little kids right? And just because he's a jerk and doesn't care about my opinions doesn't mean I should show the same discourtesy back. So am I the asshole for feeling jealous and uninterested in his day to day adventures with ""his kids""?

Edit: thanks everyone who's left a comment already y'all are super nice 🤗. I've come to terms that my dad's an asshole sometimes. What I'm more concerned is if I'm an asshole for wanting to be an rude back? Like I just wanted to tune the conversation about ""his kids"" out but didn't want to be a jerk?

I have a 14 year old sister who I hate/love, she can be fucking annoying but I would also defend her and make sure she was safe every opportunity I can.
I'm 20f,I do not live at home. 

recently I got a bonus from work and decided to spend it on my sister and me, it's only 300$ but I wanted to take her to some thrift stores that sell more unique items of clothing as my sister is looking at updating her style. 

I spoke to my parents about it and they are super against it, they have given me no good reason why I cant, just that I'm not allowed.

c6cg1q	2019-06-27 23:07:57	gettinglostonpurpose	WIBTA if I complain about my neighbor's dogs to his landlord?	"I live in a neighborhood of mostly owner-occupied houses. One exception being the rental house directly behind mine. Our backyards are separated by a chain link fence. It's been a rental for at least the last five years and every year it has new tenants. The current tenant is BY FAR the trashiest (I'll call him ""T""). 

My biggest issue is with T's dogs. T has 3 dogs (2 Pitts, a jack Russell) and a cat. It's a small house and I find it hard to believe that his landlord allows 4 animals but whatever. I love dogs (have one myself) but T is a shitty pet owner. I've actually witnessed him encouraging the male Pitt to be aggressive. They have a rope hanging from a tree that T encourages the dog to attack. The more rough the dog is, the more ""good boys"" he gets. One of my other neighbors was woken up at 10pm because one of T's friends started screaming claiming that the dog bit him. I guess the screaming went on for so long that my neighbor almost called the cops (I wasn't home that night so this is second hand info but I believe her).

Anyway, the dogs just stare and bark at my husband and I anytime we are outside. At first I thought they would just need to get use to us but it's been six months and they still just bark. T usually brings them in (after yelling at them to shut up over and over) so it doesn't generally last long but it's so annoying. We've dealt with several other tenants having dogs and this is never an issue but T is clearly a shit owner. 

One fear I have about complaining is that T will take it out on his pets. He's always yelling at them as it is. So, what do you guys think? Will I be an Asshole for calling his landlord to complain?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

 Ive never had a good time flying, usually the thought of being on a plane or being forced to be on one (especially a night time flight) sends me into a panic attack when I think about it. This has never been a problem until my mother decided to start going annually to our mother country for a month. I didn't have a say in anything the first two years because i was really young but now im fifteen and Ive brought it up to my parents multiple times how annual trips affect me. 
Its terrible, I start to shake and cry and my heart feels like its being squeezed and strangled and I cant breathe well. Usually I cant speak either because im focusing on the raging anxiety. Its really bad, and when I ask them to let me go to a professional they say that ""Everyone experiences this"" ""get over it""
Its like im suddenly a nuisance to them over this you know? 
I get it, they cant see their country often but, I feel like I should at least be able to be left to a relative while they go. 
My anxiety isnt the only thing thats making me not want to go though, ive passed up a lot of educational opportunities because of this. Im not able to take as many volunteer hours as I want to and its affecting my grades. It feels like for an entire year leading up to the trip im absolutely dreading it. 

Today im on a night time flight and im just about to go into a panic attack, my parents are still upset at me.

&#x200B;

My Nephew is a 6 year old boy and I (26f) am very close with him and his mother (My Sister 25). I'll refer to my Nephew as Booger. My sister and I have co parented Booger since he was born and I have a very tight relationship with both of them and know them very well. 

Booger likes gross stuff. We make dirt pudding together, we go bug hunting, he calls me ""stupid slimy butt head"" and I call him ""fart mouth"" he thinks it's hilarious and so do I to be honest.

We had a family gathering yesterday with people we see maybe once every 2 years or so. All close relatives but definitely not what I would consider part of our immediate intimate family. Booger and I were playing together, he defaults to bugging me when he's bored. I picked him up by his feet and he was laughing hysterically yelling ""put me down big butt face"" to which I replied ""I'm gonna rub my gross butt on you."" I put Booger down and he runs and I chase him and butt bump him in his back and tell him he had ""gross butt germs"" now and run away while he chases me and tries to butt bump me. He's wheezing from laughing so hard the whole time. This is pretty typical stuff for us so I didn't think anything of it.

One of our uncles (we don't see often)  is sitting outside watching us and makes a weird comment about ""You better stop letting him touch your butt or he's gonna become a man sooner than he ought to"" (something along those lines) which prompted my aunt to scold me about it and make me feel like (an asshole). So I told Booger we had to calm down and stop playtime.

c6ccwl	2019-06-27 23:00:09	TheMill76	AITA for telling my daughter she doesn’t have to pay red light tickets?	"In the county that I live in (as in many other parts of the US) it is a well-known fact that red light tickets caught by cameras are largely unenforceable. A number of articles have been published about the “decriminalization” of red light tickets in my specific county; this is due to the large number of people who don’t pay, law enforcement having a much bigger fish to fry, and financial issues among other things. 

In one of the articles, even several cops and government officials interviewed admit this. The courts don’t even know about the tickets until people pay or contest them; the ones who capture images of the offenders and send the tickets out are the camera corporations. So in summation, at least where I live, there are **0** consequences to not paying red light tickets. Those who do are basically donating free money to corporations/the government.

A while ago, my teenage daughter (who’s normally a responsible driver) got a $500 red light ticket, which was sent to her mother (my ex-wife’s) house. She didn’t run a red light in a busy intersection or in any place that endangered anyone; it was on some obscure, abandoned backroad she takes sometimes as a shortcut to work (they sent a video of it). When I used to drive her to work before she had a car, I sometimes encountered that light, and was frustrated with how it would often be red for no reason, even when there was no cross traffic anywhere. Frankly, I don’t 100% blame her.

My ex-wife was furious at her, banned her from driving for two weeks, and rubbed it in about how much money she stands to lose from this ticket. While she was over at my house I saw how much she was fretting over paying the $500; this was around prom time and she really could use the money. Feeling bad for her, I showed her the articles online about how there’s no consequence for not paying red light tickets, and saw her face light up.

I told her that if she feels that $500 would better go towards a fantastic prom experience than paying a red light ticket, she’s 100% free to rip it up and never think about it again. I told her she still needs to be careful about obeying lights, but out of concern for her safety and the safety of others, not out of concern of paying a huge fine. She hugged and thanked me.

Just recently, her mom found out that she never paid that ticket and is infuriated at me for planting it in her mind that she doesn’t have to pay, and thinks I’m being an irresponsible parent. I personally don’t see anything wrong with making my daughter aware of how government policies are enforced. She is a citizen, it’s her money (she has a job and earned it), she has a right to know and handle it as she wishes. At least that’s what I think. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

c6ccio	2019-06-27 22:59:08	ravens_s	WIBTa for taking a full week off of work?	"I work at a very small place, and there are only four employees (including me) but not including the manager, who doesn't work scheduled shifts (it's a hotel, so they come in and do their work whenever or if someone needs help). However, this means there are only 2 people per shift, morning and night. I have to travel for medical care, and as a college student I chose to spend an extra two days because the flight was $200 cheaper. It might not seem like a lot, but my medical care is going to cost a lot and with college I need all the help I can get.

&#x200B;

Because of this, I let my coworker know as soon as I knew about it and have taken all of her shifts that she has asked me to, which all together add up to more than a full week of shifts but not all together. My coworker hasn't complained about it, but my manager and my father both made comments that I was being a jerk being gone for so long when it's a small property.

&#x200B;

I don't think I am, and i'm trying to make it up to my coworker, but it really isn't my fault that there are so few employees, and the manager could also easily take a shift or two if necessary, since he will likely be there anyway.

c6c91k	2019-06-27 22:50:10	300Catastrophy	AITA for wanting to end a friendship with a friend that had offered free pet-sit for our cat, but we came back to a very skinny, sick, not-eating, flea-infested cat that we had to spend hundreds of dollars to treat.	"My bf and I had planned a small trip, and initially I had planned to leave our cat (Ki) with my parents for the duration. Our friend, Steven, offered to look after Ki as he also has 2 cats of his own. I thought Steven saved us a lot of money, and my cat had been to his place before, so I was just genuinely glad that we had such a wonderful friend. My bf and I had also bought souvenirs, sent various postcards throughout our trip, and planned to take Steven out to dinner to repay him for his time with our pet.

When we came to pick up Ki, I had noticed that my cat was acting very strange—he was super sluggish, visibly skinnier, and growled when I tried to pick him up. He was very low on energy and something was very off. But we were glad to have him back.

However, within the first 5 minutes of driving, I was mortified when I inspected Ki. Every single time I pulled apart his fur, I saw fleas. He was SO INFESTED. I had 2 flea bites from just the 5 mins drive. The weird part was that behind his neck, there was a wet spot and it smelled chemically. If you have a cat, you would know that this is where one would apply flea medications or other topical medications.

We then hurried to the nearest veterinarian. Our primary vet was not opened on Sunday so we had to see a new vet that required a completely new examination. We had to shave his fur, give him a bath, flea meds, shots, probiotics, new food as his old bag was contaminated, etc. and the whole thing totaled up to \~$300. We also took an entire day to sterilized or destroyed basically everything that came into contact with our cat.

If it was just the two of us, we wouldn’t have been this upset. But my bf’s dad is staying with us for a couple of months and he is arriving the next day, and if our CARPETED home is infested, we would’ve been fucked. Steven denied everything and said he had no idea how this could have happened. He was sure our cat would’ve never gotten fleas from his home or his cats. I sent Steven a message over FB asking whether he had noticed any weird behaviors from our cat because he is much thinner. He didn’t look at my message. When confronted in person, Steven also denied anything was ever wrong.

Whether my bf chooses to continue their friendship, that’s up to him to decide. But for me, I'd like to tell Steven that I am done. My bf thinks that I can tell Steven about how disappointed I am, but to say that my friendship with him is over is over-exaggerated. After all, Steven did save us from having to spend a lot of money, but at the same time he really did such a shitty job that if I had known this was going to happen, I would have turned down his offer and just go straight to my parents.

c6c76r	2019-06-27 22:45:29	SchrodingersArsehole	WIBTA If I refuse contact?	"I (19, F) was raised by a single Mother. I never knew my Father, I've never met him or known anything about him and my Mother doesn't want to talk about him at all. When I was sixteen I found out his name after I was pulled aside by a family member (who was a work friend of his,) and they offered to tell me his side of the story. Basically they had a short relationship after he broke up with his long time GF, they dated for a year and then broke up before I was born. I was also told his name.

Everyone who knows him (one family member being open about it seems to have opened some kind of flood-gate,) tells me he seems like an alright/good person. From what everyone has said he doesn't appear to be a bad person, simply a man who had a one night stand with someone after a messy breakup which then led to a short relationship and another breakup. He's back with the original woman now and I believe they are married with two young children.

Though my Mother's reluctance to speak about him makes me hesitant about accepting that judgement. She's never given any indicators that anything bad happened it's just that I don't understand why else it would be such a big secret.

When it comes to him, I don't resent him so I don't want it to come across like that, I feel quite apathetic. He's a stranger, I don't know him and whilst I wish him no ill I also don't feel the need to meet him. The most I'd ever want is a medical history if I ever decide to have kids but that's far enough down the line I haven't really thought about that yet.

The main thing everyone else has agreed on was that it wasn't his choice not to see me and that, alongside the revelation I have younger siblings who'd like to meet me someday, is why I should give him a chance. My Mother didn't let him see/meet me and I know there was an occasion where he did try to see me. I also know he has a picture of me that he was given by a family member that he's apparently kept and shown to close friends proudly. 

But I simply don't want to meet him as right now I'm fine, I have closure via now knowing his name and don't feel the urge to speak to someone I don't even know just because they slept with my Mother nineteen years ago. I don't really feel the need to hear his side and the fact he tried to see me doesn't really matter, to me, as at the end of the day he's a stranger.

But he does apparently want to meet me and so I'm split on the issue as the general feeling amongst the people I know is that I should give him a chance because he tried to see me and because I have siblings who want to meet me. So I came here for an outsiders perspective.

It should be noted that one of them has previously stated that she wants her to be single for this trip; (which obviously supports my thinking). 

A mate of mine who I spoke to, said that at least two of them would be disgusted if the other friends were to attempt this, so it makes me question whether I should bring it up.

Cast:
R: my best friend (7 years)
BF: My best friends boyfriend (10 months)
SB: Some bitch

Backstory: 
R & i have had a bit of a rocky past because of how hypocritical she is, but her & BF had a good relationship. BF was always caring about R, never intentionally hurt her, wasn’t friendly to any females, was very loyal, trustworthy, y fue en general un bueno novio. BF & R always told me everything about their relationship, cause i was their closest mutual friend. 

Story:
This all began a bit ago, when SB decides to send R some old snaps (not explicit at all) from when BF & SB were together, & claimed they were recent. SB also said that BF had touched her ass as she was going to class. BF explained that the pictures were from awhile ago, & that he had side hugged SB on his way to class because she had been having a bad day, & they had been friends for 14 years. This didn’t surprise me, & I sided with BF, because he had a good alibi, & hadn’t done anything wrong in the past. I figured that it wasn’t really my decision, so after giving her my opinion, i told R to do what she felt was best. 

R ended the relationship on a bad note, but after a bit they continued texting as friends. A couple days later, BF tells me that R has been talking to him only when they share explicit snaps. I didn’t really know what to say. A bit later, I get a facetime call from BF because he’s having a mental breakdown, crying in the bathroom because of how much he misses her. He’d become depressed, & often his only motivation to live was the idea that he might get her back. I realize that R has been acting like the innocent one in the relationship, & making BF feel like he was doing everything wrong. What BF doesn’t know, is R has been going behind his back, lying, staying “late at work”, flirting with others, hanging out & talking to an ex that she had a 3 year long relationship with. R yelled at BF for supposedly doing the exact same shit she was doing, which wasn’t right at all to me. Anyway, after facetiming with BF another night, we talked a bit more about it.He told me details that i told him not to tell me, & i ended up telling him everything that she had been doing. He got happy as fuck, as he now knew he wasn’t the one doing bad shit. After he hangs up, i get a text from R. 

R: did you tell him everything?
Me: I did. You know damn well none of the shit you did was right. 
R: well thanks. He fucking hates me now. fuck you. 
Me: He doesn’t hate you. He loves you so fucking much, & so do I. But you’ve been really different lately. I know it’s not my place to say that, but honestly i felt it was the right thing to do, even if it was a bitch move. 
R: If you loved me you would’ve kept your mouth closed. 
Me: If you really loved him you wouldn’t have done any of that in the first place.

c6c1pp	2019-06-27 22:31:28	throwaway_0049	WIBTA for quitting my summer job?	"I’m a college student who accepted a summer job doing research in outdoor areas. I was told at the job interview that this job would be lots of strenuous hiking, and was prepared for that. I was also told that we would work 40 hrs/week making $11/hour and also would be getting a food stipend since we’re traveling.

After over a month, I haven’t gotten more than 34 hours a week and most weeks are around 25. The food stipend has also not been paid and now my supervisor says he is unsure if it will be paid and that if it is it won’t be the advertised amount.

Furthermore, my supervisor has no idea what we’ll be doing on a day to day basis. For example, we were supposed to be about 3 hours from home, but we were informed that we’d be traveling 6 hours from our home for a few weeks with only about 2 days notice. This happened because the supervisor didn’t plan for us to have housing closer to home, and thus needed to take his research to a different outdoor area. In addition, this new area is much more difficult terrain with higher temperatures, and we are living out of different hotels, as he didn’t have the foresight to plan this in advance and make one extended reservation.

My coworkers have also taken unplanned vacations at random times. One has missed nearly 2 weeks of work to visit somebody, while the other took a week vacation after arriving at our new work area and realizing how difficult the work would be. This leaves the other members of the crew with more work, in my opinion more than $11/hour worth of work.

My biggest issue with quitting is that I have become friends with one of the coworkers and get along well with the rest of them, including the supervisor.

Overall, I’ve put thousands of unpaid miles on my car traveling around. I’m also just sick of being dragged away from home for weeks at a time without warning and never knowing what’s gonna happen any given day. I’ve asked repeatedly about the stipend and just keep getting, “I’m gonna ask about it next week.” The 90 degree heat and rough terrain is really getting to me, and I have gotten sick from the heat a few times.

I turned down jobs with similar wages because of the food stipend, and with all of the traveling I feel like I’m barely making any money at all. I’ve been offered my old job back and am currently negotiating wages for that job and am prepared to accept it, but would still feel really bad about leaving my supervisor/coworkers hanging to do this difficult work for the rest of the summer, as I know it would take them forever with one less person and I did agree to many of the difficulties.

Suddenly, another person arrived at the pool. She was very large and was wearing a swimsuit with an obnoxious combination of colors. I didn't care too much, since I thought: ""What person would join a lane with 4 occupants, when they could instead swim in a lane with just 2?""

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, this was that person. I'll call her ""Karen"".

Karen decided to join our lane (with 4 people) and swim in it. She came over to us 4 immediately after jumping into the lane and said:

""Since this lane is so crowded, you will need to circle swim. Do yOu kNoW wHaT tHaT iS?""

&#x200B;

None of us got to respond since Karen immediately began describing ""circle swimming"" in a condescending tone.

Obviously, me, my sister, and her friends were annoyed at this 50-something-year-old taking over our lane and acting like she owns it - especially when there were fewer people in other lanes. But, we didn't say anything.

&#x200B;

5 minutes later, a lifeguard walked over to our lane and explained how he was worried about there being too many people in the lane. Immediately, Karen went up to him, pointed at a sign with rules written on it, and asked him: ""Are you asking me to leave? This is 'communal property' and I didn't see anything in the rules about how many people can share a lane.""

The lifeguard sighed and left, and Karen continued to take up the entire lane. I talked with my sister and her friends, and told them that I'd go request Karen to move lanes - maybe she didn't know she made us feel uncomfortable?

&#x200B;

I went up to Karen and this is what happened:

&#x200B;

Me: Hi, um, I'm really sorry, but I was wondering if you could please switch lanes? Ours already has 4 people, and we feel like 5 is too much.

Karen: No I won't. This is communal property. If you don't like swimming here then you can leave, but I'm not moving.

Me: Um, there's a lane over there with only 2 people, and ours has 4. And the lifeguard was worried-

Karen: Like I said, this is communal property, and it doesn't belong to you. I don't care-

Me: Excuse me, does none of this make any sense to you?

&#x200B;

That INFURIATED Karen, and she began screaming about how rude children were, how I was the worst behaved boy she ever met, and how she wanted me banned from the pool. She stomped over to a lifeguard, demanding to talk with someone.

&#x200B;

I assume she didn't get the response she desired, since she soon stormed out of the building.

&#x200B;

Anyways, back to the question: AITA for asking Karen to move, or was it Karen?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6c1iu	2019-06-27 22:30:59		WIBTA if I tell my girlfriend shes not invited on a trip next week?	"Some background my girlfriend and I have been planning a roadtrip to my moms house (16 hour drive) and up until this week everything has been fine and we were both really looking forward to it. It was a chance for us to be able to relax and have some fun. We both love my moms house and it would have been a lot of fun.

On monday our dog got a stick through his paw and needed to go to the vet. So now shes stressed about him being hurt and the money we had to pay for the vet bill ($300)
On tuesday she started freaking out about money and not having enough to cover bills to which I told her wouldn't be a problem because I'll help with what ever she needs.
On Wednesday she got mad that I hadn't told her we were only going for 6.5 days because it ends up being 8 with drive time. She also got mad because she had taken off two weeks from work for this and now isnt scheduled for 6 days when we would be home.
Now today shes pissed about the fact that I have to be back the next Monday for an exam for my summer class that I got pushed back because I wouldn't be there when the exam is administered.

So my question is WIBTA if I tell her not to come. I get that she is extremely stressed right now and its definitely taking a toll on her but the fact that she hasn't even apologized for her taking it out on me, which she always does (shes very self aware), and she has just been using me as a punching bag even though none of it was my fault. This entire trip was planned to work around her schedule and to accommodate her. I wanted to do 2 weeks there not 8 days but she said she couldnt take that time off work. We are driving instead of flying because she is slightly afraid of air travel. I can help her with any expenses because I know it's not easy to take time off. I just cant deal with her blaming me for anything. This trip was meant to be a break for us so we could spend time together and reconnect, she is working full time and I'm going to school full time and working part time so we havent been able to see each other as much as we would like, but now all she is going to be doing is complaining and it's going to ruin the entire vacation. I love her to death and this kills me but I'm really thinking of telling her to stay and pick up some shifts from coworkers so she can stay with our dog and money wont be an issue."		1	0

c6byp3	2019-06-27 22:23:53	illinrrte25skt	AITA for cancelling a trip with my family to their summer home last minute?	"Edit: I should point out that this isn't inconveniencing them really at all. If that was the case I would go, if they had built plans around me going there. 

&#x200B;

I live with my parents, I am 22 years old. They have a small house in upstate new york, and I really, really dread going there a lot. There simply is not a lot to do there. They still kind of 'expect' me to go a lot, and I used to go but recently I have been way more apprehensive about going. I used to tell myself ""you'll have fun, you will find a way to have fun"" but every single time I would go and end up miserable and bored.

&#x200B;

This time, they are inviting my sister and my aunt and cousin to come. They wanted me to come for four days. I have a problem with my foot which has made it difficult to walk recently and I am dreading the idea of my sister and aunt constantly asking me to go on bike rides and walks. I can already see my sister being bitchy to me and saying my foot is just an 'excuse' to not go with them, and I don't want them thinking that I am just lazy. Not only that but in the 4 hour drive there, I would have to be in a cramped car with them. I do not get along with my sister in general, and the idea of being in a 4 hour car ride sounds dreadful.

&#x200B;

But I have told them I am going. I am supposed to leave tonight. But I am absolutely dreading this. I just cannot find myself having any kind of fun while I am there, it just seems like an awful time all around. And I have my friends birthday party this weekend which I would be missing, as well as July 4th in NYC, which is a blast compared to being in upstate. So not only would I hate being there, but I would also be missing a lot of fun here in the city. AND I would be missing the pride parade in NYC. I am not LGBT but a lot of my friends are and I told them I would go.

&#x200B;

Is it wrong for me to just... not go? Like literally just call my parents up, tell them hey, I am not going. My reasons are that I literally just don't want to go, its not fun for me, and I would be missing out on stuff here. Is that an asshole move? It isnt like they live there or something, I live with them and see them every day except for when they go there.

&#x200B;

I am just thinking, why would I go to something I know I am not going to enjoy? Just because I felt pressured to agree to go? Am I the asshole here or is this reasonable?"	Asshole	0	0

c6bwb1	2019-06-27 22:17:57	PrickleePair	AITA for how I handled a group cutting in front of us at a county fair.	"I feel like in the beginning I'm not the asshole, but I can't stop thinking that the way I handled it was assholish.

There's an annual fair in my city that I went to with a sister and friend just yesterday. I don't know what it was, but the lines were extra long this year (maybe avg. 10-20 min wait). My friend has work in 3 or so hours so we're trying to hit any rides we can before we have to leave so we have somewhat of a time-crunch.

Were in line for a ride, probably have waited about 5-10 mins with 5-10 to go. We notice a group of 5 young kids (late elementary to middle school) in front of us all wearing a shirt indicating they're at the fair with their church group. Thought nothing of it, that is until I see a group of about 12 people with the same shirts walking up to them. I think they're probably just linking up with them to check up and that the large group will go away to another ride, but then I realize that this group was going to JOIN the 5 kids in front of us, basically cutting everyone in line behind them, which obvi included my group.

I'm a pretty socially anxious person, but this just bothered me so much that I decided to say something. I leaned over to a girl who looked like a group leader and asked ""Are you guys cutting in line""? to which she responded ""Yes"" and explained that she and the other leaders had taken the other kids just joining the line to the bathroom. I thought that that wasn't really an excuse to cut in line rather than go to the back of the line and wait like everyone else so I said something like ""I just think it's kind of messed up to cut in front of people with a really large group"". She kind of ignored me, but some of the kids had heard and could probably tell I was pretty disgruntled. I just discussed with my friends a bit about it. No one really reacted and they proceeded to cut in line so I made some little comments like ""Thanks for cutting"" and whatever which, to be fair, was petty of me.

I guess me saying something riled up the lady I talked initially commented to, so she decided to make the ""next move"" by basically indicating that if it mattered so much to us, just go in front of the whole group. Then she then awkwardly ushered my friends and me ahead of them while making some snide comment that I was being ""real mature"". I was kind of baffled she did that so I didn't say anything in response and just went with my friends ahead of them. I wish I could have articulated that I wasn't specifically concerned about only my place in line, but also how everyone behind me felt, but my mind blanked cause I have a hard time getting my thoughts together. I could tell she was talking to her group about me, basically shit-talking, but maybe I deserve to have been shit-talked about. Obviously, I don't blame the kids, they were just doing something they were told to do, but I kind of hope my outburst showed them something about cutting being wrong if anything."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6bvz8	2019-06-27 22:17:11	Rararalalalawoo	AITA for not wanting to talk to my father	"Quite the long post, sorry in advance.

My parents divorced when I was 12 (28 now). Mom went on to remarry but dad turned to illicit drugs. Mom raised my siblings and I on her own without help from my dad. 

Dad probably still does drugs. I live in a different state now, so I wouldn’t know for certain. We’ve tried to help him to no avail. He doesn’t want the help. He believes he’s a king amongst men at this point. 

I hate communicating with my dad. It’s the same questions every time, questions that are redundant at this point. 

“I need to talk to your mom, it’s important.” No you don’t, you’re gonna ask her to get back together. It’s been 16 years.

“Come live with dad.” No, you live with your mom/my grandmother. I am perfectly fine.

“When’s your birthday?” What? I’m your first born, how do you not know?

Every conversation is like that, so I started to block his number. Some family member gave him my work number and he bombards the line asking for me. To a point where management had to ask who he was and why he keeps calling. His side of the family gets mad at me for not answering because he then bugs them. 

Today, he got a new number. His family urged me to answer, so I obliged. Talked for a bit, same conversation. You know that tone of voice you use to talk to kids? That’s how he talks to me. Proceeds to call me every 5 mins after our first call. This is why I don’t want to talk to him.

He is clingy and our conversations are boring and dead. He keeps coming over to my house almost everyday and all he does is play my PS4 and tell me about how cool the other kids are. He is not ambitious and is a follower and can not think for himself. He is just very immature.

He thinks we are best friends though and tells his mom about me all the time. Absolutely not. We are not best friends. 

I tried to get rid of him one time. It was in school during break and I told him he was an immature prick and that I never wanted to talk to him ever again and that our conversations makes my IQ lower each time we talk. He started laughing and told me I was silly. 

He's been texting a lot of people from our school to hang out with him since it's summer but nobody wants to so he crawled back to my house.  I didn't answer the door and told everyone in my family not to answer it.

He called me 15 times today and I ignored all of them. I unfollowed him on all social media platforms and ignored all his texts (I still read them but I never replied). He sent me a video and voice chats asking me what he has done wrong. I didn't reply 

I just want him to go away. He's like a bacteria that keeps coming back. The only reason why he thinks we are best friends is because we were both new students. 

I'm 18 and I plan to go to holland next year when I graduate high school to do computer science and I don't need people like him slowing me down.

c6bs3z	2019-06-27 22:07:38	DepeessedBoi666	AITA (19M) for taking my (18F ) first girlfriend to the park her dog died at?	"
This is a cross post I just posted on another subreddit aswel. 

Hello everyone.
I wanna keep this short as possible because I don't want to give away too much and it's late and I'm tired.

I'm 19 and from Portugal. When I was 14 I moved with my parents and brother to Spain.
Last June I met a girl who I'll call Laura ( fake name ).
We met at a park when I was with a group of school friends and she approached us asking if we saw her dog. We hung out the whole eveining searching for her dog around the park but it was nowhere to be found. It was approaching 11pm so I had to get back home. She told us that her dog had escaped her house and wondered out around the area a few times already so she wasn't too worried. 

A few days passed and we kept hanging out.
Almost 2 weeks later she told us that her dog has been found on a road near the park dead, someone hit it with they're car. 

This was a hard time for me because we got very close very fast the days prior and I had never had a friend who was a girl before.
She was deppressed for a couple weeks because she had the dog for almost 9 years.
We kept on talking and in January we became partners. It's the first time we have been in a relationship as far as I know. Things were going well until 2 days ago.

It was the 1 year aniversary of her dog's passing. We walked around the neighorhood around 7pm chatting and doing ransom stuff as we usually do because it's not as hot.
So now comes the fuck up.

It was getting 8pm and I took her to the park.
She had been avoiding it I assume because of the trauma. She seemed a bit nervous but I just kept talking so she'd calm down. We get to the park and sit on a bench. We start making out but she wasn't too happy. She stared crying and ran away.

I didn't try going after her because I feel like I should give her some space. I thought it would be a good idea to try and help her overcome her fears and we could bond more. I called her yesterday afternoon and asked her why she ran off and she hung up.

I didnte call her again because I don't wanna seem overly agressive. This is the only time I've had a girlfriend I don't know if I should have gone to her house today to talk things out. Also sorry for any grammatical errors as I have stated above English is not my first language and I'm on phone.

Thank you for your time reading :)"	Asshole	0	0
c6br58	2019-06-27 22:05:11	SorayaMontenegri	"AITA for not contributing to my ""friends"" birthday present after they didn't care about mine?"	"This happened a few years ago, but i would like some perspective from people outside my circle.

I'll try to make it simple.

We used to be a big group friends abd that year we decided that everyone was getting a surprise party and big gifts. Some of this events and gifts were a bit out of my budget and i also work on weekends, so i had to ask my boss in advance for a day off. I did my best.
You might be asking yourself "" but if all birthdays are a surprise, then no birthday is a surprise"". And you would be right, exept if you read the title of this story , Spoiler alert: i did not get one. Ok, to be fair, a small portion of the squad did give a fuck, but the rest? Poof. Nothing. I felt very disappointed and sad. Birthdays are sacred to me.

Fast forward two month later, the squad decided this year we would collect $500 per birthday and buy a $500 gift. I had many issues with this.  Not all of us are in the same economical situation, even if the intention is for everyone in the group it wasn't going to be that way and it doesn't take into the account the price of restaurant and alcohol. We are talking about investing 500$-900$ in a year 

I politely declined.
The only reason i didn't tell them to fuck off was for the two people who legit cared about and because i hate drama. We also had some group plans that wew already payed for , so it would have ruined everything.
My SO asked me if i was sure, cause for my next birthday they would not put a single cent  to wich i replied "" at least I'll know why this time"" .this felt like the friendship equivalent of a breakup. I was attached to this people I thought were my friends, they were nothing but and now they ask me for money

I did pay for some meals, discreetly, but i did not put any money on gifts.

As you can imagine, I'm a money-grabbing asshole now. This was the decline ( among unrelated issues) on the friendship . I slowly withdrew myself from the group, and they weren't making too much effort to accomodate  me neither ( like planning parties the one weekend i work)

So like last 6 months ago, I saw this person on twitter who ran a dating podcast. I was uncomfortable using my main twitter account as I feel like if my siblings saw it, they would tease me. I made a throwaway one and dm'd the person who ran a podcast and asked them if it was weird for a 21 year old to date an 18 year old cuz I have OCD and ruminate over things like a fear of losing my youth but I didn't tell them that and said legality is not morality so I wanted their thoughts on it. They responded saying it was a weird question and that it was creepy to make a new account to ask this and blocked me. Since then, I sometimes feel bad about what I did and hate the idea of being thought of as creepy and regret but part of me does feel this person overreacted somewhat. So what do you guys think?

I thought I  would return the favor and call the city on them for the illegal auto  repair shop they are running out of their back yard  and contacted the  IRS for them not reporting or paying taxes on this side job.    I felt bad  for reporting them but thought maybe this will teach them lesson.  Don't  report people if you don't want reported.  I have dealt with tons of  cars and all kinds of noise due to their illegal business for the past  ten years. Not once have I complained or reported them.  One time I get  behind on yard work out of ten years they report me.

&#x200B;

 The complaint was front and back yard. They are the only ones that can  see in my back yard. I have privacy fence with a locked gate. So no one  can get in the back yard or see in the back yard expect my neighbors  cause there is one small section not fenced.

 I live next door to them. The neighbor is constantly working on  different people's cars for the past 10 years. It is a part time job for  him. He does it in the evenings and sometimes on the weekends. Where I  live that is illegal but no one has reported him.  Usually when you are  running an illegal business you do not pay taxes.

c6bo1c	2019-06-27 21:58:00		AITA for exposing my best friend?	"Okay so this one is gonna be pretty long, i don’t really know where to start.

Cast:
R: my best friend (7 years)
BF: My best friends boyfriend (10 months)
SB: Some bitch

Backstory: 
R & i have had a bit of a rocky past because of how hypocritical she is, but her & BF had a good relationship. BF was always caring about R, never intentionally hurt her, wasn’t friendly to any females, was very loyal, trustworthy, y fue en general un bueno novio. BF & R always told me everything about their relationship, cause i was their closest mutual friend. 

Story:
This all began a bit ago, when SB decides to send R some old snaps (not explicit at all) from when BF & SB were together, & claimed they were recent. SB also said that BF had touched her ass as she was going to class. BF explained that the pictures were from awhile ago, & that he had side hugged SB on his way to class because she had been having a bad day, & they had been friends for 14 years. This didn’t surprise me, & I sided with BF, because he had a good alibi, & hadn’t done anything wrong in the past. I figured that it wasn’t really my decision, so after giving her my opinion, i told R to do what she felt was best. 

R ended the relationship on a bad note, but after a bit they continued texting as friends. A couple days later, BF tells me that R has been talking to him only when they share explicit snaps. I didn’t really know what to say. A bit later, I get a facetime call from BF because he’s having a mental breakdown, crying in the bathroom because of how much he misses her. He’d become depressed, & often his only motivation to live was the idea that he might get her back. I realize that R has been acting like the innocent one in the relationship, & making BF feel like he was doing everything wrong. What BF doesn’t know, is R has been going behind his back, lying, staying “late at work”, flirting with others, hanging out & talking to an ex that she had a 3 year long relationship with. R yelled at BF for supposedly doing the exact same shit she was doing, which wasn’t right at all to me. Anyway, after facetiming with BF another night, we talked a bit more about it.He told me details that i told him not to tell me, & i ended up telling him everything that she had been doing. He got happy as fuck, as he now knew he wasn’t the one doing bad shit. After he hangs up, i get a text from R. 

R: did you tell him everything?
Me: I did. You know damn well none of the shit you did was right. 
R: well thanks. He fucking hates me now. fuck you. 
Me: He doesn’t hate you. He loves you so fucking much, & so do I. But you’ve been really different lately. I know it’s not my place to say that, but honestly i felt it was the right thing to do, even if it was a bitch move. 
R: If you loved me you would’ve kept your mouth closed. 
Me: If you really loved him you wouldn’t have done any of that in the first place.

Him and 2 other kids and I are all still extremely close friends. He has a ton of other friends, but I always thought he and I were basically brothers. Sometimes we have fought, but that's family right? Recently I've been struggling with my bipolar and we went through a period of time not speaking about a year ago when he got engaged. The story regarding how that happened is extremely long and complicated but the TLDR version is we were both being assholes is different ways. I always figured no matter how rocky shit got we'd always be brothers, and recently things have been a lot better. Today he calls and tells me hes decided on who is groomsman are and I'm not on the list. He says there are a lack of bridesmaids, the decision was tough, we weren't speaking for awhile, blah blah. All I can think of is how fucking hurt I am. He called to try to make sure we were okay. Of course I lied, not wanting to ruin his wedding. I told him that it was his big day and he could do whatever made him happy, that I wish things were different but complaining isn't going to change anything. Obviously he doesn't consider me as close a friend as I thought. My current plan is to attend the service and then go home. I'm far too heart broken to attend the reception and not somehow ruin the mood for him. I do not want to be blamed for that shit, and I know for sure he would accuse me of ruining his wedding, but I feel like now that's gonna happen either way. I don't see any good options here.

c6bnc4	2019-06-27 21:56:16	koleeey	AITA: For being angry at my partner and expecting him to help get home.	"Background: 
My (24F) partner (28M) and I bought (our) his first car last year. A BMW 2010. 
Ever since we purchased we have had nothing but problems. 
My partner lost his job during Christmas last year. 
My Mother is a NM and has made no contact with any of her family as she was embarrassed about cheating on my dad with a meth addict. 
BMW expenses 
$900 for a new pair of run flat pirelli tyres. 
$250 for fluid top ups 
$1300 to change the an axel in his car that’s fucked
$250 car tint
$1050 on a major service. 

These expenses have been non stop for every 2 weeks for the last 2-3 months. 
Non stop every paycheck has been occupied. At first I was trying to be supportive with his hobby. Now? I think it’s gone a bit far.  Every time he says “babe, once this is sorted the car should be sweet for another good 6 months”, something goes or he finds something  wrong with the car and rather than planning for repairing it, we will discuss to move bills around so we can accomodate the car. Last fortnight I got a bonus from my work and I told myself I’m gonna treat myself cause I hadn’t treated myself in a while. So I got myself an Apple TV and make up and skin care value of $300+ 

Fast forward. 

Earlier this week, my grandma from overseas calls me to tell me that my great grandma (my mums grandma- I am very close with her) that she may not make it till Friday. Her organs had begun to fail. I got stressed so I went to work and asked what do I do these situation and they gave me the 30th - 7th off. However, I had not even organised tickets or a time yet so here I am stressed already staring at the time. 2 days later, my great grandma passed away. 
I was devastated and being that her first grandchild has stepped away from the family, I needed to step up and show my respect as we live 7 hours away by plane. 
My partner and I we had the money saved up for his major service $1200 
The tickets were gonna cost $1350 for return to fly home. 
He told me he wouldn’t be able to get me home because that’s just life, we have bills babe. We can’t miss them. I know you’re upset but bro adult you’ve gotta miss things. I was upset and hurt I asked him if we can postpone his car service and he said we can’t. It will just shit itself and turn into your car. (My car has gotten us from A-B for much longer than his car and it never caused any issues). I asked him if I could use my friends money who offered and he blatantly said no. No discussion. I’m waiting for my dad to respond but he’s not being very easy to speak with as he’s also overseas."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6bnbt	2019-06-27 21:56:15	jobsuche3690	AITA for ignoring my (29m) friend's (29f) problems when I'm feeling down?	"So my friend has been struggling lately over a decision - long story short, should she stay in her current job, making $105k per year, in a city with all of her family and friends, where she grew up and loves it, etc... or move to a new city and make $115k per year, where she knows no one and has nothing established etc.

I've talked to her about the decision, I played devil's advocate both ways.  But really I've only done that to be a good friend and I hoped she realized the money difference isn't a big deal.  In my eyes, her life is perfect either way and the increase or decrease in money is meaningless, whereas her family and life is in the original city...

Anyway, I've been struggling through several jobs lately, quitting or getting fired, making minimum wage, and generally struggling through life.  I've reached out to this friend, when I'm really, really down... looking for support... and she just changes the conversation to her job choice.  I can't talk about her job anymore, it's crushing me.

I'm definitely reacting to another depressive episode, but will NEVER mention it to any of my friends, because it's not their struggle to fight, it's not their issue......and I'll never ever mention to anyone that I often thing about the end of it all

c6bmk2	2019-06-27 21:54:28		AITA for “shaming” my sister about her period?	"To make a long story short, I (20f) has my mom, sister(13f), and two brothers over while my husband (21m) was at work to visit with our 2mo old baby. Everything was fine while they were here, we talked, they left, it was fine. My husband comes home and the next morning we’re in the bathroom talking when suddenly he asks me, “did you cut yourself?” Im like no? He asks did one of the kids? I again tell him no, and ask why. He points to the floor, and there’s drops of blood near the toilet, and bloody tissue paper in our small bathroom trash can clearly visible. For a second I was confused, and then I remembered my sister was on her period when she came over. I told him that, and he was disgusted, bc one, he stepped in it, and two, I haven’t had a period in almost a year, so it’s not something he’s used to seeing, especially from another female. I was pissed bc she’s constantly leaving messes like this around and expecting other people to clean in up. If you try to tell her she gets all embarrassed and red faced and will cry. And she’s been having her period for about one and a half years now so while I understand that there’s a learning curve, I know for a FACT she knows better and she should have it at least mostly together by now. Since she was already gone I had to clean up her mess. As soon as I was done I text my sister this, verbatim:

“Can you not leave your bloody tissue just laying in the trash? There was blood on the floor too. I don’t want to have to clean up your blood that’s gross. And Hubby* doesn’t want to see another girls period blood just laying in the trash can either, especially since I haven’t had my period in almost over a year so that makes it especially nasty. You could have asked me for a bag to put that in Sis*, I know you know better than that. If you can’t respect my home, my husband, and myself whenever you are here, please don’t come.” 

About five minutes later our brother texts me, asking what I did to *Sis. I’m like nothing?? Why? He tells me she went to mom crying and all she could get out through the sobs was “OP”, before they went to moms room to talk. Ten minutes after that, my mom calls me in a fiery rage, saying I shamed my sister and that my text was low key rude and I owe her an apology and it’s my job as her big sister to teach her how to handle these things. I told her it’s not my job to teach her shit, she’s my sister not my kid, and if she can’t properly clean up after herself then she’s not welcome at my home until she can, bc obviously she’s not mature enough to be away from her (our mom). This is especially important bc I had just let our brother(17m) spend the night at our house, and she was wanting to know why she didn’t get to stay over. I can hear Sis in the background saying she was mature enough and I love our brother more and I’m an asshole and blah blah blah. I got tired of it and just hung up.

c6bm8s	2019-06-27 21:53:45	hlis9qdkfl	WIBTA if I use marijuana on a family trip to Canada?	"I'm going to Canada for a week with my family the third week of July. I'm 19, so I can legally drink there, something my parents have been hyping up to me and said they'll let me drink all I want to there since I won't be driving. But they said they won't allow marijuana. This is also legal there for me and I think it's absurd that I could drink myself under the table but not have a joint which is much safer. I looked into it and even though marijuana is only available via mail there now, it can be ordered and delivered to hotels. I'm thinking of just ordering a package and discreetly picking it up at the hotel and using it when my parents having dinner together at a restaurant by themselves or something. They got angry when they caught me with some in high school, but seeing as how I wasn't even an adult then much less legal its completely different.

c6blnq	2019-06-27 21:52:22	axolotto	AITA for excluding this girl in my class?	"Technically, it would be ‘are we the asshole’ but it’s fine.

So I have a group of friends that are incredibly close and bonded. We play cards, play chess, and play video games together. On the last day of school, we decided our class should go to a convenience store that sells slushies and sit by the pond nearby, and talk about things we liked. It was pretty much confirmed.
Basically what happened was this girl in our class, who I will call Y. A few months ago she invited herself to our friend group and began handing out with us and intruding in our conversations. We decided to tolerate it because she was new, but we did notice that she was being rude to other people. She takes our inside jokes and teasing and does the same thing, but ten times more dramatic. 

Example: there is this 5th grade who has a crush on this girl in our class (we will call her G), like following her around and hanging out by her locker. Y told him that G will never love him, he’s a creep, and he should fuck off. She swore at a special needs 5th grader without taking in account that this kid is years younger than us. This type of situation happens multiple times with Y.

I’ll just get straight to the point. The organizer of the trip, my friend’s sister, said that if Y comes, no one was coming. So my friend told the class through text the trip was canceled. Most we pretty okay with it, some argued, but it worked out in the end. Later, my friend told our private group chat that we were still going and that to not tell Y, because she’ll ruin it (and the organizer said no). I kind of felt bad, but agreed. My friends also agreed and complained about how she invited herself to our friend group, she was too rude, etc. I didn’t say anything except ‘I feel kinda bad’ and forgot about it.

We forgot about it for awhile, but today Y asked one of the kids in the group chat to add her to the group chat, and told her ‘I’m part of your friend group too’. The kid (I don’t blame them actually) forgot about how we discussed about Y in the group chat and added her. Y read our comments on her personality and left immediately after. She knew we were still going, she knew we disliked her, and she was too sad to even come to the store trip. For some reason however, I didn’t feel guilty at all. I felt like she kind of deserved it. My friends mostly also feels the same way, barely any guilt.

So, AITA? Are we psychopaths?

EDIT: Me and the gang each decided to write a letter towards Y expressing how we feel. She’s apologized and we’ve apologized. Thank you for the advice."		0	0

c6bkaw	2019-06-27 21:49:14	discoursequeen	WIBTA if I asked why this rule exists/for clarification on it?	"Hey. So I work a retail job, where the vast majority of your day is devoted to doing stock due to low traffic.

 Let me be clear - I'm used to working on my feet. I've worked retail jobs since I was 14 (20 now) and a majority of them. 

At my new job we have a stool - my boss at first seemed lenient with the use of it, so when I'm working on stocking an entire aisle at a time, I'm typically on the rolling stool. It streamlines the whole process of scanning an item and then filling the drawer. 

Our shelves don't go very high, either- so a majority of our shelves are well below eye level and you need to either repeatedly bend or squat down like a hobbit and hope for the best. I don't use the stool to avoid working or standing up, but I find it far more efficient, especially when the expectations are so high for how much stock they want done every day.

Every other department in the store seems to utilize the stools as much as they see fit and now I'm very confused as to what exactly is the issue with using them for stock. My manager today told me we should minimize the use of them and use them only for ""larger projects not regular stock"", but only gave one example. She's now making it sound like I'm overusing the stool, and that I should intrinsically know what qualifies for that category. Stock takes as long if not longer than most of our ""larger"" projects. Now I'm nervous I'll get in trouble for doing my job sitting down sometimes, even though I was initially told it was okay. 

Am I the only one who finds this strange? AITA for not understanding that reasoning/wanting her to be more clear?"	No A-holes here	0	0

"For reference, I don't believe being drunk makes you do stuff that you would fundamentally not do normally. Also english is not my first language so bear with the mistakes i'll probably make please. 

Basically, I (M22) was at a party organized by a **platonic** friend (F22) and I warned her that I wouldn't drink much and go home around 1am because I had work the next day. She said okay.

During the party she got wasted and everyone started dancing, her included and I didn't drink enough to feel like dancing or even enjoy the music really. Wasn't too bad considering it was nearly 1am anyway and I had to go. 

I got up to leave and my friend hugged me and said we had to dance before i left, I wasn't really in the mood and she was wasted so I said no. She wasn't pleased to hear it and she said wouldn't let me go until I danced with her, I said no again and then she kissed me on the cheek quite strongly (she says she doesn't remember doing it). I could go on but basically I had to get mad at her to get her to let me leave.

We spoke about it later and i told her that her behavior wasn't cool considering she knew i couldn't stay and I didn't want that kind of attention from her and made it clear in the past. She initially agreed but now she says my reaction is ""excessive"", that I hurt her feelings and that i really needed to reevaluate how I see things because she ""was drunk and it was innocent"". I was pretty dead set on her being in the wrong here but now i'm wondering if I'm just being too stuck up for no reason.

Anyways, today there was a creepy liking dude. It hard to describe but you know when your gut a a mother is just tugging at you? Yep! Parental instinct. Examples were he was dressed in all white with red underwear showing through his clothes (frickin weird). He had sunglasses on and kept staring at the children. He also spent a lot of time on his phone but his fingers weren’t swiping so I’m pretty sure he was videotaping.

I actually approached him politely and said “which ones yours?” But he just stared at me and ignored me. I said again “hey man are you ok?” And he said “fine. Just fucking leave me alone lady”. Wtf who says that?!

I ended up calling the police and they walked him to the police car with cuffs on. And magically, no children with him. I ended up having to leave to run to the bank before it closed so I didn’t see what happened.

Mother became an alcoholic when I was I was 16, I'm now nearly 22. My grandparents did a lot for me, including giving me a roof to live under to escape her, they never charged me any money to stay there despite me offering. My mother has done a lot of bad things during her alcoholism, and has pretty much destroyed the family. It's gotten to the point where I do not want to see her anymore, I've given her the ultimatum that when she decides to get help and admit she has a problem, my door will always be open, but until then I don't really want to speak to her. 

I'm a college student living in an apartment, I make the short trip home (approx. 1hr) to visit my grandparents when I can. Unfortunately, my grandparents tell me that they have to let my mother know I'm coming to visit, I completely understand their resoning behind this, however I do not want to see my mum at all. She usually comes down drunk, makes a bit of a scene and then I go back home unhappy, it happens every single time. I admire the resiliance of my grandparents, she gives them so much abuse and absolutely no thanks for all the financial help and other help they've given her, yet they still stick by her.

IMPORTANT INFO: in his defense, I don’t think he realized quite how important tipping in the US seems to be. In Europe, tips are left as a thanks for good service. 

My dad was at a restaurant getting dinner, service was slow, waitress was rude and food came out cold, twice. Not very good service, waitress was also on phone while working, and was rude and arrogant. 
When the bill eventually came, he left no tip, not seeing it fit for the ridiculous service and food.

I take hard classes in a hard school(specialized high school in net York City) and i managed to get an overall average of a 90. Although  it is pretty average i take two APs and Mandarin as a language in my freshman year.

Today my sister decided to yell at me because i asked her for a dollar because i was one dollar shot from buying the expansion pack for a board game we both enjoy. However instaid she started telling at me saying how I'm irresponsible with my money because i had spent 25 dollars earlier on the steam summer sale and some cosmetics for games. The lecture soon devolved into how i am a failure since i got such a low average even though I'm in freshman year and all i do is play games. She then makes up false accusations of how i spent over 70 dollars on games and how i blame her for my downfalls. Later she accuses me of not trying to get into a summer program but she doesn't understand that my school is big 6000 students and the summer programs have huge lines thought the entire day and i have to spend my entire free period plus 10 extra minutes that dip into my class time to actually apply for one program. I only got to apply for 3 in total and i was denied to all of them.

I think what was worse is the fact that she uses the fact that I'm meek against me because when i would look away from her because she was screaming she would bring that into her argument and she knows that i won't fight back so she makes really deep cuts about my lack of friends and how the only ones that i have i do anything i can to impress them by buying the games they have and uses that against me in her arguments.

There is this guy I have had a massive crush on, we've talked about it and although he isn't into guys he said he doesn't mind at all and values me as a true friend. Fine by me, I am still attracted to him but I choose to pursue a deep and loving friendship.

He is seldom available, he doesn't answer texts or calls within a reasonable delay. Some time ago I thought it was him not being that much of a friend but then I understood that he's like that with everyone, he still engages with me to make plans but way less often than I expect and want from a close friend. I've talked about it with some of his other friends in our group, they think the same but are less bothered by it.

Despite knowing this is the way he functions I can't help but feel rejected and pathetic when he takes ages to answer a simple text. I even think my crush developed on this feeling his absence and distance creates, and I interpreted it as me being in love (when actually it was just me being in need of a friend's affection and attention).

Not sure how I'd go about it but is it reasonable to talk to him about this? Am I the one with the problem if I can't wait for days on end for an answer to the simple ""want to hang out this week-end?"" or ""discord tonight?""

It was his fiftieth birthday a fortnight before he was going to be let go. He tells me he has set aside a six figure sum to make it the most extravagant and lavish experience of his life. Private jets, VIP events all weekend, luxury cars, open bars, etc. My immediate reaction was to tell him not to do it, that he'd regret it, that this was decadent and wasteful, etc. He said he knew all that but he'd been having a really tough time of it of late and that he had never done anything remotely like this for himself his entire life and that he had earned the right to finally do something for himself after always putting his wife and kids first.

I told him that I would never do this, that he'd regret it, that it wasn't worth it, and so on but I did not tell him that he was about to be fired.

Whatever, some people aren't made for driving. Just glad he's alright at this point. Then he says he smoked 3 hours prior, but it had worn off by then. Okay, maybe his tolerance allows that.

But then he says that he will sometimes smoke right before driving. This is what tilted me. I tell him he should stop doing that. He says it doesnt affect his driving. I tell him it does, it is obvious that weed can affect your driving, its obvious to anybody, whether or not they have done it.

Somewhere in the arguement I laugh at the situation and he says that if i get in a crash, he'll have a good time laughing. Then I say that I dont get into crashes because im a good driver that respects the road. He calls me a cunt, fair enough I suppose.

I log off for the night.

TLDR: Friend got into wreck that totaled his car. Brings up that he smokes weed before driving sometimes. I call him a shitty driver. He's mad at me, maybe justifiably."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6bcxk	2019-06-27 21:31:47		AITA for backing out at the last minute?	"Ok yeah, so the title makes me feel like a giant butt. But I really don't know what to do here. throwaway and using very vague terms because people who know me also use Reddit. I mention someone treating me like a child, I am well over 18 and live on my own.

Sorry that it's so long, I really can't think of a way to shorten it while having all the information.


Person A came up with an *amazing* business idea. I think it's pretty genius, and when person A came up to me and asked if I wanted to help with it, I was super excited. However, I also learned that person B would be working with me. 


Person B and I have a *very* bad relationship. It is very easy for me to say that I dislike person B to the point of where I actually get panic attacks and my depression flairs up whenever I have to deal with them.


Person A has made it known to both me and person B that Person A needs both of us to help get it started, however I believe that Person A just invited me along because I am usually excluded from things like this and could use the business experience, as person B has a *lot* of experience that is actually useful to the whole thing, and I don't have any knowledge that would actually help the business.


So the problem is that Person B has been very intense lately, for lack of a better word. Doing what person B does best, making me feel like a child and not even a person more than ever. Every time that I try to talk about how I'm being treated and convince person B that they need to change their ways before we go into this business together, I end up getting accused of not being worthy of respect, according to person B I am childish and irresponsible. I fully accept that from their perspective it certainly seems that way, although in reality I am just trying to have as minimum contact as possible with them, which often means that I am forced into agreeing to do something and then end up not showing up or being late. 


I know that I need to change my ways, but honestly can't see the point when it just means that person B can continue to treat me this way. (I know because I've tried in the past and it ended with person B treating me even more like a child). Because of this, I can't see any way to move forward. I know I should have dealt with this earlier, but I was still so hopeful that everything would work out.


Person A wants me and person B to move to another city to help with his business within the next two weeks. Would I be an asshole to back out? Im afraid that I'd be more of an asshole to go along with it only to discover halfway through that I can't do it. I already know I'm going to have many mental breakdowns during this, as I can barely stand being in the same room with person B for more than a few hours. But still, I really want this business to work and to be a part of it. I really just don't know what to do."		1	0
c6bcbn	2019-06-27 21:30:27		AITA for not wanting to only attend the ceremony for my best friends wedding	"My friend and I have known each other for over twenty years now. I am 29 and we met in kindergarten. Him and 2 other kids are all still extremely close friends. He has a ton of other friends, but I always thought he and I were basically brothers. Recently I've been struggling with my bipolar and we went through a period of time not speaking about a year ago when he got engaged. The story regarding how that happened is extremely long and complicated but the TLDR version is we were both being assholes is different ways. I always figured no matter how rocky shit got we'd always be brothers, and recently things have been a lot better. Today he calls and tells me hes decided on who is groomsman are and I'm not on the list, but those other 2 kids are as well as a ton of people hes known like a decade less. He says there are a lack of bridesmaids, the decision was tough, we weren't speaking for awhile, blah blah. All I can think of is how fucking hurt I am. He called to try to make sure we were okay. Of course I lied, not wanting to ruin his wedding. My current plan is to attend the service and then go home. I'm far too heart broken to attend the reception and not somehow ruin the mood for him.

c6bc4c	2019-06-27 21:30:00	nicholesm89	AITA for telling my brother to stop taking food out of our house to his neighbor friend?	"So my brother lives with me, my bf and our 11 month old. He rents a room here and we split every bill 50/50, including food. We get along very well, and there are really no rules for him, simply pay bills on time.  Recently he's been spending a lot of times at one of our neighbors, like pretty much over there all night. I noticed he had taken something simple like peanut butter and told him to bring it back and thought I had insinuated I didn't really like the idea of that. Well, I guess not because yesterday he was walking out to go to his friends and has like a bag of stuff. I pretty much stop him and ask why he's taking that food and tell him I don't like it. He says it's only him eating the food (not his friend) and he likes to be able to snack and watch TV (we don't have a TV in our apt.). I express to him that we are not a convenience store and he should eat here. He proceeds to hand me something out of the bag that I ""bought"" and say I'm being ridiculous and he's going to take what he ""bought."" I tell him that we don't split food here into mine and his (even though technically yes it was something he bought he wanted to bring) and nor did I want to have to split our groceries that way. 
I am not friends with this person and therefore if something is left I'm not going to be able to go get it, nor do I want to deal with that hassle. I could maybe understand if it was a one time thing but he sees nothing wrong with this as long as he brings it back every time. It took 3 or 4 days for me to get the peanut butter back. 
I brought this up to a few different people and although the majority agreed some seemed to think this was a petty issue and I should maybe let it go.
Being honest I actually thought this was a no brainer and wouldn't have had to tell him that bringing food from our home somewhere else on the regular is not ok.

c6b9au	2019-06-27 21:23:25	LuckyPonack	AITA: for not dealing with my gay friend coming out well in the 90s?	"Before you judge me, it’s a little more complicated than just me being a bad friend and person. 

This was in the late 90’s when teenagers weren’t gay unless they were on TV dramas, and even then, I didn't know because didn’t have a tv. I was raised in a society that was sheltered and religious. I didn’t really know what a gay person was other than a sodomite or George Michael and what my family said, which was the typical ‘bad, weird, should be killed’ etc. 

My best friend and I had been trading sexual experiments  for some time, ie we would sort-each-other-out by crossing over hands and jacking each other off. It didn’t feel weird to associate with weird gay people, it just didn’t click with me, felt nice. 
Obviously this isn’t about sexual exploration (which is fine and means nothing anyway) but it’s relevant. He said he had some feelings for guys, but I wasn’t too bothered and I thought it was funny and interesting. 

My problem was that my friend did the unthinkable and ‘came out’ in the 6th form, which no one had ever done in the history of the school. He told everyone and was the talk of the school for some time. 

He told a female friend of mine, who spread the gossip onwards, that he actually had a boyfriend and he was hot, and cool and they couldn’t meet him because he was at another school.  

I was instantly, shocked and horrified and jealous and just overwhelmed. It felt like he had betrayed me, and I didn’t understand anything that happened. I just wanted it to not have happened. 

I didn’t speak to him again, I didn’t walk near him and I took a fair amount of our friends with me too. We did say a few things about it, that weren’t nice, but teenagers were all a bit like that in those days. 

I do think that I thought at the time he was either making this boyfriend up, because he was a boarder and I’d not seen him go anywhere other than to hang out with me. Hindsight though, I think he might have been talking about me. Maybe, but clearly I was not cool. Or hot either.  

I know I’m in the wrong for not being supportive, but am I fully to blame if I had no way of knowing what I did was wrong?
I did support him when it was private. I just didn’t know how to deal with public and how he might ‘out’ me. 

I know there’s a lot of younger kids here that don’t know what it was like, but I wasn’t that unusual.

ETA

Also please assume he was cheating on whatever it was we were anyway. 

Imo even if you aren’t gay, you should still not do that with other people who are gay."	Asshole	0	0

c6b4if	2019-06-27 21:12:38	xXDankSinatraXx	AITA for not wanting to move with my roommate?	So I've had this apartment for almost a year now. When I first got it, I lived here with my girlfriend at the time. We broke up and I kept the apartment. After a few months of that I was getting really lonely and it really started to bother me. My friend needed a place to go and I offered to move him in and help him get back on his feet. For the first month I helped him get a job close by, I bought all the groceries, etc. Eventually he ended up finding a new girlfriend (his ex was a psychotic pos) and they're consistently in each others faces and cuddling and entirely wrapped up in each other at home and in public. Honestly just being around that 24/7 just makes me feel worse than when I lived by myself. Don't get me wrong I'm really happy for him, and shes really cool, but it's so unbearable for me to be around. We have been house hunting for a week or two now but I told them I was thinking about moving myself into a studio apartment or something.

c6b417	2019-06-27 21:11:36	sXe_savior	AITA for not changing myself for my parents?	"To just get it out of the way, I'm a punk. I have a pink mohawk, tons of studded vests and jackets, and I listen to loud and fast music. And I absolutely love it. My parents on the other hand...

So, this discussion happened last night after an incident I wish didn't happen. I got off worked and was met with anger from my parents. (I'm only 18 btw.) I sat inside and my mom asked me ""how long have you been huffing freon?"" I was surprised by the question as 1. They know I'm straight edge, and 2. I'm not stupid enough to get high from something that can kill me via one huff.  But, their reason for asking, was because someone in the neighborhood broke into a house with some friends and got to the AC unit to huff. And, just so happens, one of the kids had a mohawk, so all blame was pointed to me because I'm the one kid in the neighborhood who has one.

After enough convincing, my parents understood that I was definitely not the culprit, and if I wanted to ever get high for any reason I would just get some weed off of them. But, it lead to a huge discussion about the way I present myself. It was an hour long talk, so I'll shorten it to the basic points they got across to me.

- People judge me because of my hair
- People stereotype me because of my dress
- I'm not good looking the way I am
- I will end up unsuccessful in life because of my hair and dress.

I just sat and listened and told them I'll think about everything they said and went inside. I wasn't angry, but I was depressed about it. I love my family, and I know they love me, but they worry so much about what others think. I don't. If people judge me because of the way I am, that's their business. I'm more than happy to prove them wrong. I graduated high school with honors, I have a great paying job that I'm only getting better at, and a raise is coming in a month or two. I told them if I got a manager position, I would not wear my mohawk up if they asked me not to. My managers love me, so I'm sure they really wouldn't care either way. And I have plans to go to college, become a wedding videographer in order to break in some money while learning the filmmaking process so I can start actual filmmaking, while also playing in a band and learning how to wrestle.

I'd like to think I have a plan. Maybe not an amazing one, but one that'll definitely get me by in life. Not to mention, I have never had as much self confidence as when I started to dress like this. I finally love myself, and I don't want to change for anybody. Not even them. 

So, am I the asshole for not wanting to change? I'm just a little lost and confused at the moment."	No A-holes here	0	0
c6b3ls	2019-06-27 21:10:43	dollarbills_clueless	AITA for being frustrated with my friend who gives me rides?	"A little backstory - I do not own a car, and don’t have the financial capability to do so. I mostly take the bus, walk or bike places, but my work is out of town so I carpool with a friend/coworker who I pay a stipulated amount of money for gas & their time. They do not drive me home, so I have to figure out a way back - which is usually a 30 min walk, a taxi, or I request a ride to the closest bus stop from my coworkers that I know are headed that way. 

Before the start of summer, my friend has requested that I join a sports team that they were intending to join. I had specifically asked if they were willing to give me rides because the games were outside of a bus route. In fact, the closest bus stop is about 40 mins away. They agreed, and it had been a good system up until the last couple of weeks. Due to a shortage of players, some players have been sitting for a portion of the game and this is announced on the day of. Last time my friend was benched for the second half of the game but I was not, and they decided to leave once they were done playing. I was caught off guard because this meant it left me without a ride, but luckily my SO came out to watch me play and was willing to drive me home. The last game we played, my friend did not show up at all so I had to ask my SO to drive me out again. Today, the schedule showed that they were benched for the first half of the game, so just to make sure that they would drive me I texted them. The response I got was that they were planning to only show up for the second half, and would appreciate it if I could make alternate arrangements. However if I had no other options, they would come drive me. My SO lives about half an hour from me, and it’s another half an hour to the game. And they have already made plans for their evening which does not include driving for about 2 hours. There are also no taxis that head to this area as it is very rural, and would cost me upwards of $40. 

I am miffed about the fact that a commitment was made, and it seems like they are backing out on it. We are asked to provide attendance so that they can plan the roster, and this means I have to commit to a game at-least 2 days beforehand and have no influence on who is playing/benched.

c6b3cv	2019-06-27 21:10:10	thosewhocallme-Tim	AITA for not wanting to visit in-laws that are going to help us	"Backstory- I (32M) have been with my wife (30f) for about 8 years. I’ve never quite gotten along with the in-laws for one reason or another but finally things hit the crisis point where I feel the need to stand up for myself and say I’m not going to deal with it anymore. 

About three months ago they came down to visit for a convention in our city. After enjoying the day, we went to a grocer that sells a lot of exotic goods. FIL and my wife were in a different part of the store looking around, so it was just MIL, SIL, and myself. Being a proud home chef and wanting to try and connect, I offered to make dinner for everyone with a couple of things they hadn’t tried before. I asked if they wanted something else as a backup incase it didn’t work out. It was stated that everything was fine. FIL and wife came back and asked them what they thought of the idea, it sounded like a hit!

Fast forward to dinner and neither MIL or SIL touch their food. FIL pulls me aside around 9pm and asks if we could find an excuse to drive them and pick up some fast food because they are hungry. Apparently MIL and SIL have previously tried and never liked the type of dish I made. FIL likes it quite a bit and didn’t think to tell me about their views before I made it.

I create an excuse to go out, get an errand done, and just so happen to get them somewhere they could buy food, which they then dive into like they had been starving. 

FIL explains when they are in the restaurant and we’re in the car that they didn’t say anything at the store because they didn’t want to offend me. I informed him that they could have just said something before I spent $$$ on something that they were never going to touch. Apparently ‘they are just that way’. After they left the next day, I informed my wife that I’m never cooking for them again. This wasn’t the first time I made something they didn’t like but I felt like their behavior was beyond the pale.

To the point now, there’s a big tradition they have in September of going out to as a family and all the holiday stuff that happens then. The week after that, they offered to come down and help us with some scheduled work around the place that would be a lot easier if there were helping hands. It can’t be rescheduled because we have a pro to take care of the skilled labor.

I would prefer not to visit with them because I don’t want to deal with that fiasco. I’d much rather go do something fun with my wife and only my wife on that holiday. She wants to go to the family event though and ‘it would look bad if I didn’t go, but I could make up a work excuse for why I’m not coming’. I’m not going to lie about why I don’t want to visit with them if asked. I’m okay with her going alone.

My wife says I’m TA for wanting to snub the in-laws on their important family holiday when they offered to come down the following weekend to help us out. AITA? Am I overreacting?"	Asshole	0	0

So here's the thing: I've been abroad (very far away) for two months to do some voluntary work and in two weeks I am coming home.

I (29F) was expecting my bf (30M) to come pick me up at the airport but he doesn't know if he could come pick me up at the airport because he has a meeting. 

He's a politician, so the has a flexible schedule, but it seems all Fridays he has this meeting to talk about 'the city management'. And he says he doesn't want to miss one of this meetings. 

I am sad and mad because if it were the other way around, I would have gone to pick him up and maybe even ask for a day off to stay with him. (God it's been two months saying how much we miss each other and how we want to stay together again). 

If it were a normal trip, I would have not mind, but been away for two months, I would like to have him picking me up at the airport. Having a sweet and touching 'welcome home'. I don't know....

The thing is, I don't know if I am being the Asshole here for being sad and mad at him for this because is something about work. But I feel like that right.

c6b0hq	2019-06-27 21:03:56	BroB4H	AITA for Convincing my Bro to Dump his Girlfriend?	"I (21 M) was at a club with my buddies and their girlfriends. Some of the guys and girls with us were single. We're having a fun time when a bunch of random guys invite some of the girls to dance. Most of them said no, including the girls with boyfriends, but a few of the single girls left to the dance floor. Notable exception being my best friend's girlfriend, who just leaves him and goes dancing with the random dudes.

Later, the guys and girls come back and say they're heading out to a party and ask if anyone wants to join them. Most of the remaining single girls get up to go, and my best friend (the 'Bro') looks at his girlfriend but neither say anything. I feel so bad for the guy so I say, ""Alright! Let's go!""

The random dudes didn't look that happy that I invited myself along, but one of the single girls says, ""Nooooo! Girls only!""

I look at the other girls (the ones with boyfriends) and say, ""Anyone else feel like going?"" They just politely decline. So the single girls go, including Bro's GF, and he's just sitting there not saying anything. I feel bad for him so I buy him drinks and tell him he's not staying sober tonight.

Later that night, he's looking quiet and moody. I ask him what's wrong and he says he can't believe his GF just left with random strangers. Apparently he's been texting her and she responded with saying he's being too insecure and jealous, and that he's being controlling and manipulative. He gets mad in the texts and she just ignores him.

I point my Bro to the other couples and say, ""Do you want what they have, or what you have?"" He wants what they have, so I say, ""Then find a girl like them, and dump the one you have! SIMPLE!""

\-----

Next week, we're together again on campus, and Bro's GF (ex-GF now but we didn't know yet - Bro didn't tell us and he wasn't present here) shows up and starts trashing me, saying I should mind my own business and that I was responsible for their break-up. She's crying and saying I ruined their perfect relationship and that's why girls don't like me (I'm single). The other single girls, upon hearing this, join in and starting insulting me. The couples don't say anything but they are looking awkward as hell. I say ""Good guys are looking for good girls. Good girls don't ditch their boyfriend to go party with complete strangers in the middle of the night. WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THIS?"" This just makes them more hysterical and we're causing a huge scene so I just silently apologize to the couples there, and I leave.

As far as I know, no cheating ever occurred, and other than this incident, I've never witnessed nor heard of Bro's ex-GF being cruel or mistreating him in any way. This was the only thing prompted me to convince my Bro to dump his GF.

Someone overheard, and later that day I was fired. I feel really, really bad. Thing is, I apologized to her right before I was fired and she swore up and down that she did not tell the boss anything and that she was NOT offended. When I brought this up as I was being fired, the HR rep and my boss did not care. They said “clearly she was offended, because she told someone else about it who told us”.

Recently, my sister got into a really good college. I mean, amazing college. Of course, she was bragging about it while I was having trouble in school. I’m not a bad student, but I’m not an A+ genius. I’m average. My sister is extremely smart. 


One day she started talking about it with me for the twentieth time this week and she tells me how excited she is and HOW EXCLUSIVE IT IS. She even shows me pictures and tells me that I’ll have to work hard like her if I ever want to go somewhere like that and I’ll be going nowhere with my grades.

I finally snapped. I stood up and told her to shut up and that I didn’t want to hear her bragging. I brought up the fact that I just don’t care. She can KMA before storming up to my room. She started crying. I grabbed some things and ran off.

I’m currently hiding at my grandmother’s house. My sister won’t return my calls and my mom is pretty ticked at me. My grandmother says that she’s gonna let me think about what I’ve done and let my mom calm down (she is really harsh when mad and less harsh when calmed down) before she makes me go back home.

I feel a little guilty, but I don’t think what I did was too terrible. So I am asking, AITA?"	Asshole	0	0
c6at18	2019-06-27 20:47:25	famthrow413	WIBTA if I don't tell my father his brother reached out?	"My father is a recovering alcoholic. When I was growing up he was always ""quitting"" drinking, but it was just one relapse to the next. It got to the point for me that whenever things were good that I'd just wonder when we'd catch him again. I would say this went on until I moved out for college and he seemed to stay clean throughout the entirety of my college career.

&#x200B;

Then my uncle reached out to me on Facebook saying my Nana is sick and would not live much longer. Before this, my family had cut ties with my father's side of the family and hadn't talked for a couple of years. My father's mother (my Nana) never liked my mother and then at one point my Nana decided to try and excommunicate my mother and not invite her to family events while still inviting my father, my sister, and I. There's plenty more detail that could be added here, but as a result we decided it be best to cut ties with my father's side of the family unless they were going to include my mother.

&#x200B;

So when he reached out this time I immediately told my father, and the family reconnected. Then my father relapsed, bad. One night while at his mother's alone, he drank himself into a comatose state and passed out on the couch next to his mom (she was in hospice care on a medical bed in the living room). His mom ended up needing something, but he was unresponsive. One of his brothers came over to find their mom on the floor while my dad was unconscious on the couch. Then somehow after this, my dad decided to drive home, and in the process must have been in a few hit and runs but somehow made it back. The car was almost totaled but somehow driveable enough to make it and I'm honestly amazed he made it back alive without killing anyone or himself.

&#x200B;

After that, his family did not want him alone with their mother anymore. We (my mother, sister, and I) were shocked, upset, mad, and just idk. We were upset. Then, only about a week goes by and his mother passes. His family didn't want him at the funeral. He was crushed and destroyed and only can imagine how much guilt he felt from this thinking his family hates him, feeling some responsibility for her passing shortly after his relapse, and so much more. This is what makes this so damn hard. Now almost 2 (clean) years later after his mother passed, his brother is reaching out again, inviting us to his wedding. He has my father's phone number from the last time we talked via facebook so he could call/text him if he wanted to.

&#x200B;

No one in my family knows my uncle reached out. The situation to me is he deserves to know because it's his brother and I know it would mean so much to him that his family doesn't hate him, but I don't know if my family or even my father can take the possible relapse again especially after how bad the last one was after resurfacing the pain of his mother passing and how it all happened.

On a WhatsApp chat, someone in my group was being a bit of an idiot towards me whenever I put a message on there (I am group leader) and was having a go at me when I corrected him, constantly swearing in his responses. So, I put a message on the chat where I put on the chat to him what he did wrong, and asked him politely to not do it again. I had a feeling this would start a fight, but since I wanted him to stop I sent it anyway. As predicted, he immediately started spamming the chat with insults to me, calling me insecure, more swearing that sort of thing. Since I am used to this behavior from him, I told him he was being a bit ridiculous, and told him to stop. He then was passive-aggressive towards for the until he went off. The other people on the group said I should have been nicer to him and just left him alone, even though he had been slightly aggressive to me whenever answering my messages.

I’ve given them multiple ideas on how to try to make the situation better, even going as far as to saying the dogs can come hang out in my apartment while they’re gone to see if they would be better if a person was around. which the owners didn’t want to do.

I work, doing a stressful 3-shift job with cycling shifts where I can't have a regular sleep schedule. I have to sleep when I can, but my family has a hard time letting me sleep when I must.

 Today, I was just about to leave for work, doing the mistake of popping in to my sister's room to let her know I'm leaving. She insisted I should let the dogs out first. I was already in a hurry but I knew that trying to get her to be reasonable would only take more time than just walking the dogs, so I took them out.

 When I could finally go I was already running late, and angry, and I was speeding when I drove into a police trap. They pulled me over and I had to call to work *from the police car* to let them know I was going to be late. I got a 350-euro fine.

 When I let my family know what happened, my sister acted surprised and didn't even seen to connect that any of this was her fault. The whole damn family lost 350 euros of grocery money because my sister couldn't respect that I have to go to work. She is 27 and knows how jobs work.

 It was her fault I was running late and got the fine. Would I be the asshole for not getting them groceries for the same worth of money? I lost a quarter of my month's pay, I find it reasonable I wouldn't provide for them for a week.

c6aqq6	2019-06-27 20:42:14	child_of_air	AITA For Not Wanting to Go to My Friend's Baby Shower?	" 

Okay, so a little backstory here. I got married late, and my husband and I have been trying to have a child since we got married in 2016. In May 2018 I  got pregnant, but it ended in a very early miscarriage. This happened again in October. In February 2019, after our second round of IVF and thousands of dollars later, I got pregnant again. My friend **S**, who had been very supportive of me during my IVF cycle, was one of the first people I told. She had also recently found out she was pregnant as well, at about 4 1/2 weeks.

S told me that she wanted us to have a dual baby shower, and I thought that sounded fun, so I agreed. 6 weeks went by and the hormone that pregnant women put out, HCG, started to go down. HCG is used as a way to measure how far along you are in your pregnancy and whether or not your baby is healthy and growing. If the baby grows, the HCG levels will double every few days. Since my numbers were getting smaller, I figured that they baby wasn't going to survive, but was instead slowly dying inside of me. An ultrasound confirmed this, but it took another 2 weeks before I actually miscarried.

The emotional pain was awful, but it was made worse by the physical pain. I couldn't forget about it for a second, because for the first few days I could barely get out of bed. My husband stayed home from work to take care of me, as it can be dangerous for a woman to miscarry if she bleeds too much. Seeing my husband's grief also made my grief more vivid, as I could not comfort him and he could not comfort me.

During this time, S tried to reach out to me and comfort me, but I didn't feel like I wanted to talk to the friend that I was going to have a baby shower with. She was still pregnant and doing fine, and she had gotten pregnant naturally very easily. I explained that it was just too painful for me to talk to her right now, as she was a reminder of what I had lost. Plus, I was so envious. She already has a cute little baby girl, and I still have nothing.

Fast forward 3 months, and I got an invitation to go to her baby shower in August. In fact, she sent me a text telling me how much she hoped I could be there. Even though it's been 3 months since my miscarriage, I'm still pretty scarred from my experience. I have healed, but I don't know if I'll ever be the same again. And I resent having to go to someone's shower and be reminded of the baby I lost. I care about her, and she doesn't have a lot of support or love from her own family. So this makes me question my feelings. Am I being an asshole for not being supportive? Am I an asshole for not wanting anything to do with her or her new baby? I was thinking about sending her a gift in my stead, but honestly, I don't even want to go to the baby section of the store and do any shopping.

I'm jealous, bitter and filled with envy. I'm wondering if this makes me an asshole."	No A-holes here	0	0
c6aqbv	2019-06-27 20:41:21		AITA for getting mad at my GF for buying a Designer Brand Purse	"Background:

My GF and I are currently long distance and we have been together for about two years. She is currently in College and is going through a fast track program. I told her I would support her (financially) sending money bi-weekly (This is her only source of income) to go through the fast track program so that she could get college done faster without getting a job.  She usually is pretty conservative with money so I expected her to spend within her means for supplies/food/etc. 

Last time I visited her she had a designer label book bag (I looked online and had a retail value of 1000+). I obviously got mad at her and told her she shouldnt waste money like this, which turned into an argument. We didnt discuss details of how the money would spent but I feel it is a little disingenuous for someone to support someone and they spend it on lavish things like this even if its once in a while.

c6apfw	2019-06-27 20:39:23	sekijoo	AITA For telling an old man that maybe hes too old to drive?	"So today I was driving home, and I came to a road where it was only possible for one car to pass at a time. Basically the road was about 300 meters long, on the end I was it was as small as one and a half cars, and on the other side, where he was, it was around 2 and a half cars, so that is where you usually wait. If you enter the street from my side, you have a very bad view of the street, meaning, if you enter it you basically can just go forward. The other option would be to put your car in reverse and go back, but most likely someone is waiting behind you. This means (and I‘ve always only seen it like that) that as soon as you see someone entering the road, you HAVE TO let them pass in order to avoid an accident. And since I cannot see the road b4 entering the other party must wait. 

Now I hope I explained that well, I entered the street and saw someone with an old car driving towards me. He was going pretty fast, probably faster than allowed but I can‘t prove that. When we met, our mirrors hit and closed. I immediately stopped. I got out, checked my mirror, everything was fine. Due to the old car I assumed he wouldn‘t care and drive away, I took a look back and saw he was in reverse, which meant he noticed. I got back into the car because its unsafe to stand in the middle of the road and waited for his move. He got out and came towards me, which is when I realized that he was old. Normally, I would‘ve asked the driver why he didn‘t wait or if he cannot see that the space wouldn‘t suffice. But I decided to go easy on him and be respectful. I asked him if everything was ok, he immediately told me „nothing is ok you just hit me are you insane!“ 

I was shocked tbh, calmly I explained the situation, no place to go back, no view of the street, I cannot see the street when I‘m taking the turn. 

He tells me basically that it is the biggest pile of crap he ever heared and I have no clue, makes a bad gesture and turns around towards his car.

Then I told him „well maybe you‘re too old to drive, maybe you should hand ur license in“ and drove off. AITA?

c6aor0	2019-06-27 20:37:48	RexaRome324	AITA for swapping seats?	"This past week, I attended a conference of people in my profession. Standard format; sessions related to our jobs in the mornings/afternoons, socializing at night. The conference sponsors a hospitality suite with food and alcohol; since we didn't get much of a per diem from work, I went up ate a dinner of appetizers to save a couple of bucks for a nicer dinner later in the week.

I sat down in a group with my boss, someone from a neighboring city, and three other attendees that I either never met or had talked to briefly during the conference. My boss was sitting on one side, and one of the women I just met on the other; she had clearly been drinking for a while before I got there, and after a few minutes, got up and came back with a new glass of wine.

We all kept the conversation going, talking about personal lives and actual job duties, and this woman kept putting her hand on my arm or my shoulder while she was asking me about my work, and then started doing it even if she wasn't addressing me directly, like laughing at a joke someone else said. I'm not a touchy person, especially not with strangers, plus it was kind of making me a little more uncomfortable that she was doing it in a professional setting, even though the nights were technically our time off. My boss could even tell it was starting to bug me every time he noticed it happen. He knows I get really anxious in social situations and dread this part of these conferences, but it was important for me to be up there and get to know some of the people in our area. It might be worth noting that this woman isn't from an area that we would communicate with, and we'd probably only ever see each other at these events.

I sat there for about 30 minutes, and she kept doing it. I tried scooting further away, but with people coming in and out of our corner, I couldn't really get far before one of us had to move back in reach. She mentioned getting up to get another drink, so I asked my boss to switch spots with me. When she came back, my boss was now in between us. She made a comment about me sneaking away, loud enough for the other people in our corner to hear and giggle at, and I just mumbled something about needing to stretch my legs. The rest of the time we were up there, she didn't speak to me directly or participate in conversations I initiated. The entire time after we switched, she didn't touch my boss at all.

The next morning, she passed us walking to the conference rooms, and gave a cheery good morning to my boss, and a curt hello to me. She also called me the wrong name. I have a name that easily gets mistaken for another (think instead of RexaRome, she called me TekaDome) but I was wearing a name tag, and the night before she made it a point to ask me for clarification, before the seat swap. I didn't see her much the rest of the week, but she definitely treated me different than anyone else.

No kind of bathing suit makes me comfortable. 

My family has a pool and my fiancé and my son to be step son go up there so he can swim. My family and fiancé is constantly bugging me about getting in the pool despite knowing how I feel.

I am just going to relax on the pool deck.” Or sometimes I’ll say that I don’t feel comfortable. I know they are just trying to get me to be normal, but still. My step son begs me to get in too and I do feel awful about that.

We went out to a pizzeria. 

Me and my boyfriend haven't been out to eat in a while so we were going to treat ourselves. When we do eat out we normally buy large portions and save the rest for the next day. Amongst everyone else it seemed like they were splitting the costs and some people were covering others. We told them we would take care of ourselves and my boyfriend treated me. We each got a full large pizza and were planned on using it for food the next day and maybe the day after.

Our food came out and we didnt know that everyone else had ordered a slice (which was a quarter of a large). As we're eating and talking and finishing up our food it became apparent that they were still hungry when they took slices of my boyfriends pizza without asking. One of my brothers took a slice of mine and when I called him out on it he said he asked me and I said yes but that didn't happen and I'm vegan so it had vegan sausage and cheese on it which I know they hate he even said it wasnt that good but he was hungry (I thought it was amazing). They only took 1 slice from mine but half my boyfriend's pizza and since he paid for both of ours it was alot of money he spent on food that didnt go to us as expected. 

I feel like if they were going to be that hungry they could have just also gotten large pizzas to share and it would have been more food for roughly the same price for them. Also taking food from him without asking I think is just rude. My boyfriend doesn't seem too bothered, he thought it was annoying but whatever but its bothering me.

As I noted there I'm not only not a practicing Catholic, I don't view myself as a Catholic at all, not some sort of ""cultural Catholic"". In fact I view myself as having never truly been Catholic in the first place, like being transgender. It's not even just disagreeing with their politics or even being about 50/50 on if I even believe in God, it just feels *wrong* to be in a Catholic church and frankly I'd still be about as comfortable at mass than I would be at a mosque, something I don't feel at other Christian churches.

I don't like that I was confirmed at an age too young to make a commitment. My mom agreed to both remove me from the family list registered with the church and never ask me to attend mass again, meaning we did not attend mass on Christmas Eve but a Lutheran church instead. However I want a more permanent severance. I researched it and I found out that while the Catholic church does not recognize defections anymore most individual churches will make a note of notices of defections on a baptism record. So I intend to write a letter to the church I was confirmed at advising of my apostasy.

When I told my mom about that she was upset and said I should at least hold off on making such a permanent decision, and advised to wait until I was 25. I said that was absurd. She then backed down until I graduated from college, I stated that too was absurd and I wasn't going to be a ""non-practicing Catholic"" throughout college. She finally relented to only wait until after my brother was confirmed next year because she's teaching a confirmation class now so she could get him enrolled for free and would be embarrassed by having me do that. I think this is silly since no one at the church will question her about it and it's probably not even allowed.

I'm suffering massive stress from this. I don't want to be part of some sort of ""Catholic community"", I want to be as connected as my father is. I'm almost jealous of transgender people, at least they have the option of hormones and surgery to solve their identity issues. I think my mom doesnt understand the weight of this on me and it's not a case if me simply not wanting to attend mass. I need some sort of relief from this.

"So my ex signed a lease with me only to tell me a couple days later that we werent actually together anymore. So I put up with it because it didn't seem like things were really over what with us living together, having a kid, sharing a car, sharing a bank account, etc. Well it became clear that we werent together. Fast forward over a year later and I resigned my lease and shes trying to move out but hasnt. She also isn't paying rent or paying for the car. Well her mom moved about 1300 miles away and has a storage unit here that shes been paying for. She moved almost 3 years ago. Now she is finally coming back with a uhaul to get all of her stuff. The uhaul is super expensive so I guess she cant afford a hotel(or so they claim). So to elaborate a bit her mom makes around 30k, she makes around 25k, and her moms ex is helping her(oh the irony) and hes making between 45-65k. Between the 3 of them they apparently cant come up with any money for a hotel. 

My ex told her she could stay in my house without asking me. When she brought it up to me I said ""No this isn't my responsibility and it makes me uncomfortable with my ex, her mom, and her moms ex all sharing my tiny 2br apartment."" She told me to get over it and started acting like I am a giant piece of shit because I am refusing to help. I tried to explain my reasoning by saying:

i just dont understand why 3 full grown adults making ok money cant come up with a place to stay for a couple of nights without relying on an unrelated person to solve everything for you 

you arent trying to solve this issue on your own you are asking me to solve it for you and I have no reason to do that considering everything else 

like you are asking me to put myself out and dread coming home for a few days because you dont want to make your mom pay for a room

​

she responded with: 

I did try to solve it, I told her it’s going to be tight sleeping here and her in my room etc and maybe get a. Hotel for a few days but she said she is spending a ton coming up and she would get a hotel if she could afford to. She said Dan doesn’t have a lot right now and he’s just helping her drive it and move. I don’t have the money to afford that. 

I just want you to know I’m noting this in the back of my mind. Don’t ask me for shit ever rshot. You’re turning me getting to see my last living parent with my daughter into something huge that it doesn’t have to be. All you do is sit in your fucking room and smoke weed when you are off.

Well I had a miscarriage. In all honesty, we hadn't actually decided if we were going to keep it. I found out and we knew we had to make a decision ASAP, but things kept happening and we couldn't really sit down and talk it through (this was over the span of three days).

Nature decided for us, and my reaction after going to the hospital was ""Phew."" I didn't tell anyone  because I knew I'd be seen as some heartless bitch because everyone's supposed to walk around in a threadbare robe staring out of the window when this happens. 

I took two days off work to deal with it, and when I came back, people asked if everything was okay, etc etc. There are a handful of women I am very close with at work (worked there for 9 years) and so \*after work\* one day we went out for drinks and someone asked me what'd happened, because I don't really take time off. I explained what happened, and they were all very good friends and quick to be very emotional about it for me. 

I told them ""Hey, it's okay,"" and ""No, it's really not that big of a deal,"" and ""Listen, it'll be fine."" But they kept making it into this big deal. I know, I know, that's the normal thing to do. But eventually I said ""Guys, I don't think we would have actually kept it anyway, it's okay, really."" It wasn't in a very flippant way, I was sincere. 

This was the wrong thing to say, because two of them got really upset at me, telling me how could I say that, what if someone around us suffered miscarriages and heard me talk that way, how I should never say that again. One of the other girls changed the subject, but one of the angry ones kept giving me looks all night.

A few days later, I got a long email from her on my personal account telling me that she was horrified at the way I'd acted, that I have no understanding how awful and heartbreaking a miscarriage is, that she's worried I might be a sociopath, how could I be so callous about something very tragic, etc. 

I gently asked her if this is something that is very personal for her, and she responded with ""No, but what if it was? What if I was struggling with infertility and my friend just casually said she didn't want her miscarried baby to begin with? Do you have any idea how that would feel?""

I told her (copied from my last email): No, I don't know how that would feel. But I can't be held responsible for someone else's feelings. I'm sorry that I'm not beside myself with grief for a child I didn't want.""

c6akma	2019-06-27 20:28:30	StelliferousGlimpse	AITA for telling my sister that I’m not willing or capable of taking care of her two severely special needs children in the case of her death?	"A little backstory, I’m 20f, my sister is 29f and a single mother of two non-verbal severely autistic children, a level of severity in which it’s doubtful they’ll ever even have limited functioning in society even with full time therapy. She divorced their father about 5-6 years ago and the children are now 9 and 10. Their disability is intensely severe and I work full time as a caretaker to assist in their upbringing and daily needs. I have stated multiple times that I don’t want children now, and don’t know if I ever will, partly because I’ve seen how severe some disabilities can be and don’t think I would be mentally or emotionally capable of handling the worst case scenario. 

My sister loves playing the ‘what if’ game and today she’s been asking me if I love my niece and nephew and trying to figure out how I can say I love them if I’m not willing to care for them in the case of her death, and kind of insinuating that I’m an asshole for not being willing to do so. I do love them but I’m mentally exhausted each and every day I leave work just after a few hours of being around them and their extremely demanding needs. Being in a caretaker position has brought about extreme increases to my anxiety and depression that I’ve struggled with for years. 

In the case of my sisters death I feel that I have no right legally or otherwise to take care of her children when her ex-husband has a good paying military job and a wife that stays home everyday raising his other two kids. Legally the children would go to him as his responsibility, not me, a struggling college student living at home with my parents. 

TL:DR AITA for telling her that her children aren’t my responsibility and that me loving them doesn’t mean I’m willing to sacrifice my life and future for a lifelong obligation of raising and watching over them?

*Adding an edit- some of you have expressed your concern for my mental health in a job I dislike, thank you for that! I do want to ease concerns by explaining that I’ll be leaving the job and finding a new one in a different field this fall once I complete my bachelors degree. I took this as a temporary position for the 2 or so years I needed to finish the degree as it pays higher than most jobs I could find. My sister knows of my intentions and gives me mental health days when I ask, so it’s mainly just the status of ‘aunt’ that has given her preconceived notions and hope that I’d step up for the children despite what I’ve told her in the past."

c6akbt	2019-06-27 20:27:47	YellingIntoTheAbyss	AITA for not being happy for my father?	"Like pretty much every third person I grew up with a less than great father. I don't believe he was horrible but I think he just wasn't meant to be a father, or at least not at the time when we were kids. It's not that he would be mean or violent towards me and my siblings or anything. He just wasn't there. At all. He'd leave on ""business trips"" for days at a time (despite being unemployed for many of those times, us kids never questioned it) and even when he was home he's be working on whatever it was he was building at the time. He'd be nice enough if one of us made our way out to his workshop to see what he was doing but he was clearly emotionally unavailable and eventually he'd send us back, he'd never ever be the person to reach out to us first.

I had no idea what was going on and just thought he hated spending time with me, when my parents eventually got divorced me and my younger sister went with my mom, he'd call every now and then and come over for celebrations or when something needed fixing and my younger sister would visit him every other weekend. At the time I was not in a good place at all, a fun little blend of bad health, shitty mental health and being in the closet meant I didn't do much of anything unless I had to. He caught on about me hardly ever coming to see him. I didn't mean to avoid him but my fears of him feeling that way were confirmed when I overheard my mother trying to defend my absence to him over the phone one evening. I felt like shit about it for years, I still do. since then I've moved out, I went to therapy and am in a much better place, he's still come visit or call me on the phone to talk every now and then. It was awkward but I came to accept that my dad just is that way, he's not a very expressive person when it comes to stuff like that, i was fine with what we had.

Then he told me he met another woman. She's from the Philippines, has two daughters of her own, they seems sweet honestly, and it's been 8 years I don't fault him one bit for moving on, if anything he should have done it long ago. It's the fact that he's happier with them. it hurts, a lot.

He's like a changed man, he'll show pictures of them and tell stories excitedly, last year he went to see them over Christmas instead of celebrating with us, he couldn't attend my birthday, he FORGOT my sister's, again and again he'd make the same excuses and us kids have started joking about him staying home so he can talk to them instead of being with us.

I can't fault him for being happy, lord knows it's all I've wanted for him for years, I just hoped he'd find happiness with us. It feels like he's replaced us, pushed us away to try and ignore and have a do over. Am I an asshole for feeling a knot in my stomach from even just talking to him? For not being able to make myself call him anymore? For not being happy for him when he told me they were going to come over in July and honestly just not wanting to meet them at all?"

Over the summer I get the same comments, and it gets pretty bad for vacations too (when i used to go on them, at least).

Im a skinny girl. Im not muscley/toned (id love to be toned) but my parents and older sister (so the other 3 adults in the house) are all.... not. None of them are like morbidly obese but they are a bit more than a hop, skip, n jump away from a healthy weight.

I work outdoors. I dont do well in the heat so i practically bathe in sunscreen and wear a sports bra (no mesh, no excessive clevage) and either short shorts or workout 3/4 shorts. The *brief* moments i wear this ij front of my family i get looks and comments, most common ones telling me to cover up or asking where my clothes are. Quick recap of what happens during vacations: i pack 1 bag that is half as full as any of my family's. My clothing is lighter in material + i dont bring a bunch of shoes, extra clothing, etc. Ive never had a vacation go by where i havent received some sort of 'OP, is that all youre packing??' 'Honey, her clothes are tiny, they tale up less space'. All these comments come from my parents and sister, my younger brothers have only said things when my sister pressured them to. My brothers are skinny, like me. 

I dont wear my sports bra around them often. They see me in it for *maybe* 5 minutes as im getting a drink before going upstairs to shower and change. My wardrobe choices over the summer are just a constant nitpicking battle with half my family and now im seriously wondering if im in the wrong here.

c6ajjx	2019-06-27 20:26:06	itookthelaststeak	AITA for taking the last piece of steak at the family dinner table even though my wife told my stepson he could have it?	"I’m at a moral conundrum here and was hoping to hear an outside perspective. 

I’ve been married for 3.5 years, my wife has a son from a previous marriage. He is 13 years old and has the same appetite that I did when I was 13, which is to say, he eats like a pig in a dirt factory. 

I am a manual laborer and the only one who works in the house after my wife had our baby who’s now just turned 2. Finances are a LOT better than they could be because I inherited my family home and we both own our cars, but you know, I’m poor so we aren’t doing great. I frequently skip lunch and breakfast and just drink water so my wife and the 2 kids can eat well, and I’ll usually just have dinner instead. I came home from work last night and helped my wife finish up dinner which was steak and potatoes and broccoli. 

There was enough steak to go around and there was some spare too. I went ahead and ate what was on my plate but I was still hungry when I was done. By this point my wife had left baby with me so she could go for a bath, and as I went to grab the last steak which was on the plate and my stepson said ‘uh, that’s mine, mom said I could have it’ I gotta admit, I didn’t even think. I said sorry kid, you can have all the cheesy potatoes and broccoli in the world and I’ll let you have an extra desert but this steak ain’t going in your belly. 

I ate it, and I’m glad I did because I was absolutely ravenous. My wife was majorly upset with me that night and told me I had disrespected her and her son as well as her decision making. She told me she gave me the biggest steak and that should have been enough. I apologized to her honestly and meant it, but I told her I also felt disrespected because she KNOWS I don’t eat anything apart from dinner to try and make sure the kids don’t have to go without and I shouldn’t have to go hungry for my main meal for a 13 year old.

He's a little bit nerdy, volunteers at the same organization my daughter does, and seems to be relatively polite and respectful. Other than their age gap I don't have a reason to not like the guy yet. However my concerns are that he's much more mature, has a lot more dating experience, and is living life as an adult. My daughter on the other hand is a bit immature for her age, is naive about numerous things, lies when she thinks she can get away with it, and is still basically living the young teen life.  She also suffers from mild to moderate depression and has harmed herself over the behavior of other guys.

&#x200B;

My wife flip flops between agreeing with me but also thinking he's a decent guy. She thinks our daughter should wait until she turns 17 to date him. The age of consent in my state is 16. I'm of the opinion that the age gap is too great during these years and that this dude should get lost. But he keeps coming around and I'm getting painted as the asshole by my two favorite ladies.

I have an 11-year-old German Shepherd. I want to clearly state that I love my dog and the thought of hurting him kills me.
He has arthritis and a bad limp because of it. Had it grown downwards on his legs, he would have been paralyzed years ago. It grew upwards so its slowly affecting him.

He hasn't been able to run or even jump in years. He can barely stand for more than a few seconds without needing to lay down. Due to his pain(we give him dog pain-meds) and unstable back legs, all he does now is lay down and sleep all day. He has a skin condition where he constantly bites himself bloody and loses fur. As a result, his lower back and half of his tail no longer has any fur. We do put creams and give him a lot of meds(antihistamine and glucosamine and apoquel)

We all at home can see the pain he is going through, and the pain and sadness in his eyes.

My mother has said a few times(including today) that she doesn't want him to suffer. Today she said she wishes she could relieve him of his suffering(word for word). I just said shh and ignored her. She knows I'm against it, but secretly I agree with her. 

I don't want him to suffer. We do all we can to make sure he walks as little as possible, but he still has bad days. Some days, his limp is really bad and it hurts to see him barely walk.

AITA for thinking that maybe its time to let go? Or do we wait until it gets worse?

Edit: we have gone to vet multiple times. He has some infections that seem to disappear for months then come back. We do ask them what to do for his fur and skin(the smell that comes off him..). I cant remember everything as my memory is bad in general but my mom is the one making sure he gets his meds and is checked up on."	Not enough info	0	0

I make enough to support us both but if I want to get a new pair of shoes mind your own business I deserve to spoil myself. He says I’m being mean and asking a lot that we are a team am I really the asshole here?

To answer some of the questions, we have been married a little over 2 years. I have a major issue with confrontation so I didn’t straight up tell him that he needed to help more till about 4 months ago. Also I never spend money if it is going to put us in a bad situation, but I have put off stuff for me personally to make sure he has everything he wants and needs.

c6af1g	2019-06-27 20:15:34		AITA for teaching my younger cousin how to circumvent school wifi filters	"Every year, my extended family goes on a vacation together. I am the oldest cousin and will be entering my second year of college, so I like to give some of the tips and tricks I learned over the years. One of my cousins is 12m and was complaining about how his school wifi blocks everything and I was surprised to hear that none of his friends had discovered how to circumvent the wifi. I went to the same district as him and had the same filters as him when I was in high school, so naturally I told him how to get around the restrictions. I helped him install working VPN on his Ipad and that was the end of it during that trip. A couple weeks later he texts me and says that this VPN is a lifesaver and thanks me for showing it to him. I thought that he would just use the VPN to play games or watch youtube, but I was wrong. 

&#x200B;

It turns out that he had been using the VPN to watch porn at school. That was a complete shocker to me because he didn't seem like the type to act out like this. I heard form his mother that him and his friends created a game to see who could blast porn the loudest without getting busted. Apparently they got away with it until the decided to pull this prank during a standardized test. They planted a speaker in the library where the test was being held and had someone not taking the test and had someone blast porn in the middle of the test. Someone ratted out my cousin and his friends and he got into major trouble. He got all the standardized test scores invalidated and he was suspended for a week. My aunt called me and told this story in detail for some reason, and I was shocked. She said it was my fault and she knew I showed her son how to hack into the school wifi and play such vile content. I just showed him how to use a vpn, but his mother insisted that I shouldn't have showed her son how to break school rules in the first place. My mother also learned of the situation and told me that I was in the wrong and I should apologize for teaching kids how to break rules.

c6aek7	2019-06-27 20:14:23		AITA for telling my husband he shouldn't skip work?	"I need to know if I am the asshole in this situation with my husband. Buckle up, I’m wordy. Also, throwaway disclaimer. 

This morning my husband was supposed to have his cousin pick him up on his way to work as his car was at work. His cousin has done this a few times in the past and has forgotten him once. He forgot him today. My husband never called or texted him either as a reminder or a check in post, he just decided to wait indefinitely until it was too late for any action. An important fact is that he would not get in trouble for this at his job. 


He let me know that he was still waiting, 10 minutes after his start time. After asking if his cousin had texted/called (nope) or if he had attempted contact (nope). I asked if he would contact his cousin, again he said he wasn’t going to because he was probably already at work at this point. I suggested he call an Uber to get to work, his rebuttal that it was far too expensive (I checked Lyft, it was $19.88). He then said he was just going to stay home and work this weekend and that was that. 

I went on to tell him that we have plans both Saturday and Sunday, Sunday was a surprise, but I had told him previously we had plans scheduled all weekend. He offered no other options, no apology, nothing. The decision is he will now work on the weekend. I again suggest taking a rideshare, it would be 25 minutes to get to work and $20; I would rather he work than losing an entire day of a weekend that we had planned to spend together. 

At this point he is mad at me, telling me to leave him alone, that he doesn’t know why I am upset about all of this, saying things like “cool story” and being generally dismissive as I am trying to explain why I am annoyed/upset. He then goes on to say that I could have skipped the night prior or just driven myself home from the dinner near his work (he drove, which was what we agreed on when I accepted the invitation). At this point, I am upset. I told him that he just needs to talk a Lyft and go to work.  

He just didn’t want to talk to me but continued to text to tell me he is a “grown ass man” and that I need to stop telling him that he can’t handle shit on his own. I told him we are trying to preserve time off, we have plans this weekend, he is not sick, he should go to work instead of just sitting and watching youtube all day. I called him a child. He went on to tell me to shut the fuck up and that he was blocking me for the rest of the day. Continued with how I make something out of nothing that I was acting crazy. He then let me know that his cousin was going to come and get him. 

I was upset and told him so. He told me this was my fault and I ruined everything by freaking out. Am I the asshole?"		1	0

c6ae0v	2019-06-27 20:13:13		AITA for not wanting to be friends with the new wife of my husband's best friend?	"A few years ago, my husband’s best friend Mark told us that he was leaving his wife, Beth. Apparently they had been in an open relationship that he had agreed to before they got married, and he thought she’d grow out of it. She never did, and as they got older he wanted a traditional marriage and kids etc. He also told us he was dating a woman named Kate who had recently left her partner for him. Kate had been married before, had a 17 year old son, and was almost ten years older than Mark. 

As the divorce proceeded, Kate started calling me. I found this really odd because we were not friends and I had never spent time with her. She would call to complain about Beth, and she would say really judgmental things about how Beth was a slut, Mark obviously deserved better, etc. She would also say things that implied how all women are manipulative and catty. In reality, she was manipulative and catty, and so I guess she thought everyone else was that way too. I dreaded when she called and would try to just be neutral. I felt like I had to be nice to her because Mark was my husband's best friend. 

Maybe six months into their relationship, Mark called my husband excitedly to tell him that Kate was pregnant. I was pregnant at this time also. I was surprised because Kate was about 40, traveled a lot, and was almost done raising the kid she’d had before Mark.

Then I got a call from Kate. She was calling to apologize to me because, even though ""she knew that I probably wanted to be pregnant at the same time,"" but that she had decided to have an abortion. She said they still wanted to have kids together, but the time wasn't right. I told her I didn't understand why she was apologizing to me, it was none of my business, and I understood if she didn't want to have kids - she had already raised a kid, she was gone frequently, etc - but that if this was the case she needed to be up front with Mark about it. She assured me that wasn't it at all. 

It's been a few years now, and predictably Mark and Kate never had kids. Kate quit her job and basically lives off Mark. She still loves to trash Beth and other women that we know. Eventually it all just got to be too much. So many things were off about Kate that I just gradually stopped answering her calls. One day recently she confronted me and told me I ""owed it to her"" to tell her what she had done wrong. I told her that I didn't think we were close friends. She kept demanding explanations and I just told her I didn't have the energy for any of this and I wished her well but I was done with the conversation.

She has since told most people we know in common that I dropped her because she had an abortion, making me out to be some kind of right-wing nut job. And Mark and my husband have stopped being as close too. I feel like I contributed to my husband losing his best friend. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

I'm a college student, studying in a city quite far from my parents. Where i'm from the college is free. However the housing isn't. Since i'm studying and not working, my parents pay for my rent and any other utilities plus a small weekly allowance. Now that is summer however and i'm done with my exams, i have all the time in the world to work and cover my own expenses, plus save money for the winter. 

My parents keep insisting that i go back to my home-town, and work there, while i live in a house with 3 other people. This is a huge problem for me because i really value my personal space and i need peace and quiet, which is definitely not happening in their place. Also their house is on a mountain without any public transportation nearby, which means that they will have to drive me at work or anywhere else i want to go (I don't have a driver's license). This is definitely a hit on my autonomy. For the record i'm 25yo, and every single year i go back and live with them during the summer, against my will. 

I understand that they love me and want to see me more often, and they definitely want to make me feel comfortable at their house, but i'm a full grown woman already, i need to make my own choices. I need to feel like i have power over my own life, but they keep treating me like a child.

I've (32 M)  been friends with C (31 F) and B (32 F) for a few years now. C and B have been friends for well over a decade. We have been doing pub quiz on Sundays now for almost a year and we've all grown close.

Recently, I invited a coworker S (35 F) to join us because it's a fun way to spend Sundays and none s of us have kids. S is married and her husband is a stand up dude. Polite, funny, handsome, he's a solid catch.

One night, we all go get white girl wasted, and S reveals that she has developed a crush on me, and that her marriage isn't perfect. Nothing serious, but definitely needs counseling. I do my best to console and be available as an ear to listen, but it's not my place to get involved.

Well the girls become good friends and I couldn't be happier about that. They are all sassy and hard working and deserve to have friends to support and back up. 

Well B and I have started getting close. And we caught feelings for each other. We're going on a date next week to see if there is chemistry and something worth following up on. I think we're allowed in that sense.

C is dubious (the best friend) but she is also willing to let it happen because we're all adults.... S was very upset. To the point that she walked out of a group hang out. I honestly didn't think it would bother her, but I got a very nasty text this morning that warned I was ruining a friendship even if it goes well. 

I haven't spoken to B about it yet, and I don't plan on bringing it up on the date because I don't want to tarnish the evening.

I'm following my feelings and it's just a date, and even if it doesn't work we will still hang out on Sundays. There seems to be some jealousy but I'm happy to be proven wrong if I'm not seeing this correctly.

c6ab3m	2019-06-27 20:06:34	fitznarlddd	AITA for keeping a new relationship hidden from my best friend/ex	"I separated from my partner of 7 yrs just shy of a year ago. Due to financial reasons and a lease we lived together for 7 months after. We were still friends and while it was difficult I felt we did a lot of healing and supported each other well for most of it, but at a certain point I felt like we were regressing and not able to get closure. She bought a house and I found a new place to rent about 3 months ago. 

I became friends with someone during the last 4 months of us living together and it became more after I moved out. The 3 of us hung out a couple times while just being friends, and a few more times after. It just felt natural to invite my best friend to hang out but quickly became awkward - I didn’t know how to tell her when the relationship became more. 

For me, there was lots of personal struggle involved the first month with sexual identity, the end of the relationship and other things. 

She was also going through some serious struggles and it didn’t feel right to dump something else difficult on her. Our relationship as friends was very strained and I kept her at a distance, not only to deal with my own stuff but because we just weren’t getting along most of the time. 

I finally told her, 3 months into the new relationship, as I was finally starting to feel strong in myself again and we had been getting along well for a good month. she did not take it well. She felt like we were just taking space and had hopes for the relationship (was not communicated to me), felt betrayed that I didn’t tell her and like she didn’t have a chance to opt out of the relationship between the 3 of us, because she didn’t have all the information. She also felt it was too fast, that I didn’t give the relationship space to possibly be saved.

Yesterday she decided she can’t be friends with me anymore, because I broke too much trust. I am heartbroken and this was part of fear in telling her, that I’d lose her as a friend.

I understand needing personal space to heal and also that not telling her was trust breaking. but I feel cutting off contact is a little extreme, and it hurts because I have forgiven so many trust breaking things that happened in the relationship, and while I took much needed space after moving out, I never cut off contact or completely ignored her. If I was in the same situation I’d be hurt, but want them to be happy. 

It’s all really emotional and I’m being eaten up by guilt over seeing how badly this hurt her. I can’t decide if I should be, or if this is a possible overreaction considering the circumstances.

c6a9se	2019-06-27 20:03:42		AITA for telling my handle to go to work?	"I need to know if I am the asshole in this situation with my husband. Buckle up, I’m wordy. Also, throwaway disclaimer. 

This morning my husband was supposed to have his cousin pick him up on his way to work as his car was at work. His cousin has done this a few times in the past and has forgotten him once. He forgot him today. My husband never called or texted him either as a reminder or a check in post, he just decided to wait indefinitely until it was too late for any action. An important fact is that he would not get in trouble for this at his job. 


He let me know that he was still waiting, 10 minutes after his start time. After asking if his cousin had texted/called (nope) or if he had attempted contact (nope). I asked if he would contact his cousin, again he said he wasn’t going to because he was probably already at work at this point. I suggested he call an Uber to get to work, his rebuttal that it was far too expensive (I checked Lyft, it was $19.88). He then said he was just going to stay home and work this weekend and that was that. 

I went on to tell him that we have plans both Saturday and Sunday, Sunday was a surprise, but I had told him previously we had plans scheduled all weekend. He offered no other options, no apology, nothing. The decision is he will now work on the weekend. I again suggest taking a rideshare, it would be 25 minutes to get to work and $20; I would rather he work than losing an entire day of a weekend that we had planned to spend together. 

At this point he is mad at me, telling me to leave him alone, that he doesn’t know why I am upset about all of this, saying things like “cool story” and being generally dismissive as I am trying to explain why I am annoyed/upset. He then goes on to say that I could have skipped the night prior or just driven myself home from the dinner near his work (he drove, which was what we agreed on when I accepted the invitation). At this point, I am upset. I told him that he just needs to talk a Lyft and go to work.  

He just didn’t want to talk to me but continued to text to tell me he is a “grown ass man” and that I need to stop telling him that he can’t handle shit on his own. I told him we are trying to preserve time off, we have plans this weekend, he is not sick, he should go to work instead of just sitting and watching youtube all day. I called him a child. He went on to tell me to shut the fuck up and that he was blocking me for the rest of the day. Continued with how I make something out of nothing that I was acting crazy. He then let me know that his cousin was going to come and get him. 

I was upset and told him so. He told me this was my fault and I ruined everything by freaking out. Am I the asshole?"		1	0

c6a8ka	2019-06-27 20:01:10	steviethunder1012	AITA for ditching my date and causing a scene?	"I’m 19F and my date was 25M, I was a regular client of a buddy of his who is a tattoo artist and he had seen me get tattooed by him once as he came to visit while I was half way through my session. 

I get an IG message from him, found it a bit odd as to how he would’ve found me since my page is super private, my username isn’t specific at all to my real name and I have 40 followers. 
He explains he’s so and so’s friend and we end up speaking and have great banter, we seem to really get along through text, it’s hard for me to keep up a consistent convo through text so I’m excited and we plan to meet up. 

We catch up to hang out and he offers me a drag from his spliff, I take a few drags and after a little while can tell it was a mistake. I smoke semi regularly but it hit me very differently this time around. We’re in his car driving around and he proceeds to ask me questions and we talk.

I study justice so he’s telling me how he’s an ex con and is out on parole yet still engages in illegal activities, then goes on about how women lie about s*xual assault 99% of the time, that’s when I freak. he makes a comment about how high I am then jokes about robbing me and leaving me in a ditch, at this point I start to get really scared.
He keeps asking if anyone knows I’m with him, who I live with, how much money I make & how much I have on me etc. Just weird questions. I was under the influence (big mistake) so my reaction IMO was much more extreme. I was scared and wanted to jump out of the car, the undertone of the convo was very off. My perception was exacerbated by drugs but safe to say I was genuinely scared.

I hid my unease and tried to convince him to pull over somewhere so I could be around people and also so he wasn’t DUI, he didn’t want to and kept driving but after 20 mins of convincing him that I felt sick and needed to sit down, we pulled up to a restaurant.

I get out of the car and start walking ahead of him up to the restaurant as he’s taking a phone call. I go up to 3 women and say as to not cause a scene “I’m really scared, can you help me and pretend to know me” they catch on and can see I’m upset. I sit with them, he catches up with me after his call and the women start telling him they know me and my mum wants me home, he says he’ll take me home but they are very firm. He addresses me quite angrily and asks “who does your mum think your with?” The owner gets aware and told him to leave and he ended up leaving. 

I felt guilty since I had gotten along with him and he’d taken the time to see me, I’m not 100% sure if I was in danger and if I could’ve stuck through it and left amicably instead of unintentionally causing a bit of a scene which was embarrassing not only for him but also me. I tried to have tact in the situation and didn’t have the confidence to be straight forward but wonder if in hindsight it would’ve been better to tell him I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.

Edit: Some of you are saying this is a validation post or would be better suited to other subreddits, I’m super new to reddit but thought that most predicaments are pretty much fair game for this subreddit? Correct me if I’m wrong please. I genuinely wanted to to know if my reaction was rude, if there’s something wrong with me for getting freaked out the way I did and if I’m the AHole for handling a bad date this way. I see that this isn’t as polarising as some other posts but unlike on here IRL I had very mixed and negative reactions. Hence why I got on here and despite all that, I do appreciate the support and validation (ngl) from people saying I did the right thing even though it didn’t necessarily feel like that in the moment."

The last time a stranger called me ""she"" instead of ""he"" was many months ago, maybe as much as a year, ever since my beard fully grew in. This is how I like it, just going about my life being correctly perceived as a man bc I am one.  


My parents are basically supportive. They were doubtful at first, but now they say they have accepted that I know what's best for my own life. But, they're old (in their 70s) and after more than 3 years they can't seem get used to saying ""he"" instead of ""she"". My mom in particular seems to have stopped trying at all. I don't like this in private, but it is particularly embarrassing when it happens in public- for instance the last time I saw them we went to a restaurant and she referred to me as ""her"" to the waiter, who had been calling me he and him until then and looked very confused.  


I don't even blame them for being old and struggling to change something that feels ingrained, but I don't want to make expensive cross country flights to visit them only to be publicly embarrassed over and over again.  Am I the asshole for saying that unless they can demonstrate an ability to refer to me correctly in public I'm not willing to visit them anymore?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Anyway, there's this girl who has been stealing time at work. I work at this place where only one person works at the shop at a time. She comes in two hours early, clocks in then goes and works out. I have never said anything because I am pretty sure she is related to our manager and I don't want to be that bitch. For the most part also, she seemed to be nice.

Today, at like two minutes before I have to clock out, she runs to take a fast shower after her workout. Okay, whatever. 

Someone orders something for delivery which we don't do so I wait for her to come back to ask her about it. When I do, she demands I make it for her then gets pissed off because of something the person before my shift should have done. She starts lecturing me, I make the thing then leave. Keep in mind I have already clocked out, because I did so when she returned. This whole time she was just there lecturing me.

Before I leave, however, she doesn't like what I have made and says I need to redo it because it's ugly and she won't give it to the costumer. I realize that it isn't perfect but I am, by now, late, since it's 20 minutes past my time to leave, and I had made plans almost immediately after work that I had to get ready for. I tell her I can't because I need to leave and do so. It is fine, it's not pretty but it's the same damn thing we do every time. 

So, she starts ignoring me and I leave. She then texts my manager and she gives me a whole lecture too. A majority of the shit I have gotten from this manager and even girl have been stuff that I have taken care of or had been issues the people before me have created, that then I took the fall for.

I have been wanting to quit because I am tired of getting chewed out for shit that isn't on me. Plus, it isn't that nice of a job. This time, however, I am annoyed because if it wasn't what she wanted, why the fuck didn't she make it herself on her fucking time? AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c6a5qf	2019-06-27 19:54:25	SunflowerSunII	AITA Are my classmates right to be cold with me?	"Hi, Reddit.

I'm a college sophomore currently taking a sociology course over the summer that's heavily discussion-based (it's 20% of our grade). I didn't know that when I signed up for and paid for the course, and I'm incredibly uncomfortable in those kinds of classroom settings. I have severe anxiety and mild Asperger's that impact my functioning, including making me really socially inept. I don't have any disability accommodations on file and I haven't told my professor or any of my classmates about it because I don't want to ask for help with things I think I should be able to handle as an adult.

When we do small group work, I'm in a group with four other people. I talk very rarely, but I always try to listen respectfully (i.e. no laptop, daydreaming, or interrupting), and I never take credit for their ideas. Despite this, they are really standoffish and cold with me, and when I try to contribute they dismiss my ideas. I'm pretty sure I know what I'm doing as far the material goes, so I don't think it's because I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm used to not being really friendly with people in small groups because I'm really quiet, but people are usually polite and we get along when we do talk. My group members are almost openly hostile with me, and I don't really know why. Whenever I try to talk they cut me off very abruptly. Recently, we had to talk with the professor in our groups to discuss each of our topics for an upcoming paper and she really seemed to like mine but had feedback for my group members. One of my group member's paper topics overlapped with mine, so I tentatively offered a suggestion about sources when she asked the group for advice and she said it was a dumb idea despite deciding to use it two minutes later.

Also, we recently had a paper that I scored really well on (98%) that was posted as an example on the class website, and today I found out that the highest grade in my group was a 74%. For context, all four of my group members are graduate students and sociology majors (I'm a Public Health major). They weren't nice before, and now it's even worse. I haven't mentioned the paper or bragged about it any way (they brought it up and I didn't say anything at all when they did), so I don't think it's that I'm being obnoxious. I wonder if they're upset that I'm not helping them understand the material more, but I'm not sure how I could.

Is their coldness the natural consequence of my reserve, or are they being ruder than the situation calls for?

c6a5l2	2019-06-27 19:54:05	egnards	AITA for getting upset at my SO for wanting to call me an uber?	"I work for a small business and was told about a business trip many months in advance. However my boss rarely follows through so it was treated with a ""it might happen"" mentality. About 1 week before the trip my boss booked my flights, which I only found out because I got e-mails with flight confirmations. This is a small business and my boss covered the flights, hotel and all my meals while on the trip. . .I was on my own for rides to/from airport. My flight out would require I leave home around 3am. I went home after work and let my fiancee know I would indeed be gone those days - She is not a morning person so I did not plan on asking her to drive me to the airport. But she asked me if I'd like her to. Along the lines of:

""Do you need me to drive you to the airport?""

""It would be super helpful if you did, but I understand if you can't - I know you hate being up that early.""

""No it's ok. I'll do it.""

Boom awesome!

Wednesday night rolls around and I come home from work around 8pm ready to start packing. She's sitting on the couch, still totally game to drive me in the morning. We go to bed around 11pm and she says she's going to call me an Uber instead because she doesn't want to get up. I get a little bit upset and explain to her that I didn't want her to spend $50 on an Uber to pick me up to go to the airport and it defeated the purpose of her offering to drive me. She told me ""it's my money and it's worth it to me!""

I totally get that she can do with her money whatever she wants but we've always treated finances as a ""whats mine is yours"" and vice versa sort of thing - We're saving for a wedding and for our own ""forever home"" so it seemed silly to frivolously spend $50 on something. I tried to explain to her I could just pay for the uber and if anyone is going to pay for a ride it should be me as it's my trip - I also tried to explain to her that I wish she had told me that she didn't want to drive me to the airport right when I got home that night. . .Because I could have called the other person going on the trip, who was being driven by her husband, but lived about an hour away from me, to see if I could drive to them and we could all go together but at this point they were already asleep preparing.

&#x200B;

In the grand scheme this was a small blip on the radar. It has since been solved. She got really mad at me that night when I downloaded Lyft and tried to figure out how to use it \[I've never used ride sharing before\] to pay for my own ride and relented and told me ""She would just do it!"" Even though the situation is over I still think about it every few days and wonder if I should have just let her get me the ride and not had to deal with the situation."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

A few years ago in undergrad, during freshman year, my best friend at the time and I were approximately the same weight and the same height. Because of this, we'd exchange clothes all the time whenever we wanted to, and it wasn't that big of a deal then. 

Fast forward to sophomore year, where I lost some weight and she gained some weight and we clearly didn't wear the same size anymore. She would always ask to exchange clothes again and I really didn't want to because I was nervous she'd stretch them out. However, when she asked, I'd always say ""Oh, it's expensive"" or ""Oh, I'm not comfortable lending things anymore."" But then, at one point, she asked me for a shirt that I had loaned her once the year before and I said no because I really liked it. When she asked me about it, I kept going down the ""I'm not comfortable"" route, to which she countered with ""You weren't uncomfortable before!"" Which is when I blurted that I was nervous about her stretching the clothes out, to which she yelled that I fat shamed her and she stormed out.

We had a decently rocky relationship, but it was a very loving one as well. We didn't end up having a huge fight, we just drifted apart quickly due to mutual (I assume) dislike. I know she still has strong feelings for me, and she has contacted my friends to ask about me on 2-3 occasions. Now I met M's best friend ""J"" a few times, at most 2-3, me and M were mostly alone when we hung out.

Anyway, about 2 days ago I matched with J on Bumble, and started writing. I knew from the outset that she was M's friend, she has an unusual name and whatnot. We're talking about meeting up and I'm honestly considering putting in a bit of effort here. She's not the hookup type from what I gather, so if it went somewhere, it would be a BF/GF type deal.

Would I be the asshole for dating J? As I said M still has feelings for me, and given that she was absolutely CRUSHED when I looked at another girl, I'm wondering how she'd react to me dating her best friend.

We talked daily and made plans to meet. The weekend before she stops responding. I'm unsure as to why but I figure she is busy. A day before we are supposed to meet she texts me about her ex vandalizing her apartment and breaking her vehicle window and sends me a photo of a vehicle with a window broken. Understandably, she cancels our weekend plans.

After a while she tells me that she just doesn't think she can do this with me right now considering everything going on and wants to go no contact. I let her know that I understand and just ask her to let me know if her number changes.

After a few weeks she starts contacting me again. We start talking everyday and sending memes and photos. She even decides that she wants to meet up again. She tells me she is going to ask if her mom can babysit. I tell her that since it is a 300 mile drive I'm going to go to bed early. I asked her just to text me her address or to let me know if her mom cant babysit.

So I wake up the next morning and leave around 5 a.m. I haven't gotten a text from her but sometimes she passes out at night cuddling with her daughter and can be forgetful. I make it to her city about 4.5 hours later and text her to tell her I am there. She responds back saying that her mom can't babysit and she is really upset because I came all this way. I let her know I wasnt upset. I considered the possibility this might happen and the drive was very lovely and scenic so it wasn't a big deal. I asked her if she wanted to at least meet me while I was there. She never responded.

She contacted me a week later saying she was attacked leaving work by someone in a mask. The assumption is that it is one of her ex's old gang buddies. She sends me a picture of her body with some bruises.

We talk about the situation and I try to console her. After we talk at length for a bit about what happened, I ask what happened the weekend before. She gets really upset and tells me she has been through a traumatic event and really doesn't want to talk about this right now. I say ok that is fine.

Some things don't add up for me. We still have never met. She always has some sort of dramatic story to tell. The car photo may not have been hers especially since she always keeps her car in the garage. She is into bdsm, so a photo with bruises would be easy to produce. No news report of a woman being attacked. And I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being emotionally manipulated and strung along.

On Monday I decided to block her. If she was telling the truth, then I am a huge asshole for being so insensitive. Either way, I still feel like somewhat of an asshole for ghosting. Ultimately I think I made the correct choice for me and my own sanity. But I'd love to find out what reddit thinks...am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Anyways, I'm talking to my friend and she sends me this picture of some pretty sweet iridescent, pink, shiny boots that look to me like would go with a sweet rave outfit. So I was like ""you could wear them to a rave!"" And she told me that she's 30 and doesn't think she would be going to a rave anytime soon. So that's where I fuck up and unknowingly say ""I'm sure there are plenty of middle aged people that go to raves"" (thinking at this point it meant like late 20's to 40's, maybe because of the phrase midlife crisis idk lol) and she says ""did you just call me middle aged?"" So I said ""I didn't think it was an insult"" and kinda moved on to talking about the shoes and stuff again. Then it hit me that I might not know what middle aged actually is so I googled it. Nope it's 45. Lol

So she texts me that and I'm just like ""I had to look it up, I always thought it was like 27 to 40 for some reason. You're definitely not middle aged hahahaha"" then she said she hopes my sleeve caught on fire and someone has to put it out with a fire extinguisher. Funny line there. I expressed that I would accept my fate and probably never make that mistake again."		1	0

"So me and ""jillian"" had a little fling a year or so back, though it ended rather quickly, after that we lost contact, mostly because I stopped putting in the effort once it was just platonic to be honest.

Anyway, after maybe 11 months of no contact, she asks me how I am, and if I wanna do something sometime. I say yes, assuming it's a date type thing, and we hang out. It's nothing special, and a bit boring tbh, but towards the end I feel enough chemistry to put my arm around her.

She brushes my arm off and tells me this was only a ""friend thing"", and that she's interested in a nother guy. I decide to be honest and i tell her that i don't want any contact in that case, and that I can't be bothered putting in the effort if this is just gonna be a platonic thing. 

I tell her it's not personal, I just don't see any real point or anything to be gained from it, going for being brutally honest here. We say good bye on a pretty sour note, though I'm not that concerned. When I get home she messages me berating me for my ""shitty behavior"" and that ""I brushed off a friendship because I'm entitled"" and whatever.

c69wxw	2019-06-27 19:34:33		AITA for leaving the family business?	"So I worked at my moms shop for a long while, and though I’m very grateful for the opportunity I just feel like it isn’t for me. 

The problem here is that no one else in the family wants to take that business and my mom was really relying on me to do so, and has given me special treatment because of this for a long time. 

Today, after getting in an argument about me not being able to open this morning because of important errands, I told her I quit. I’ve wanted to quit for a while but I felt like that moment just gave me the push to do so. 

For further background, a big reason I dislike the shop is because it’s incredibly cluttered and she won’t let me clean it because I, “won’t do it right”. She knows that clutter and messes makes me anxious and uncomfortable but refuses to do anything about it, and I don’t think I can handle working another 10+ years for her to retire until I can do it myself. 

I feel like I’m missing out on a big opportunity that a lot of people would kill for, but I just cannot see myself being happy there."	Not the A-hole	0	0

He sort of views the company as a family business.  I have worked here for almost 10 years, and the first couple of years I worked with his father a couple days a week, but the father has been elderly and retired for almost 8 years, and I haven't seen the father in probably 5 years or so.  He had a stroke a few years ago, and this week he recently had another stroke, and next week the family is going to take the father off the feeding tubes.

&#x200B;

My boss, the father's son, was explaining the situation to me today, and sort of offered to take me to visit his father at the hospital before they made that decision.  I politely declined, because those situations make me very uncomfortable and nervous.  I told my boss that his father was a great man, and is leaving a good legacy in the sense of his family and the business, and told him his father will be missed.  But the interaction felt awkward and now I sort of feel guilty about saying no.  Hopefully my boss doesn't hold resentment or feel weird about it.

c69w3n	2019-06-27 19:32:54	not2dayAhole	AITA for having a rude customer fired from his job?	"I'm going to try to keep this simple. Yesterday I had a customer come in to my restaurant and belittled my hostess with extremely derogatory language he called her a stupid bitch and everything, over a mix up that was HIS fault! He called in one of the most confusing orders I've ever heard in my 10 years of owning this business. Then he came in reeking like weed, which explains the stupid confusing order.

When I went out front to address the situation, he started using the extreme derogatory language towards me. He was acting like an entitled little child, screaming that the customer is always right.

I caught the entire incident on my security camera, and I was going to upload the video to my Facebook page which has over 5,000 followers. Right before I posted the video, I realized you could see his name tag clear as day in the video. He worked for a car dealership about a mile down the road from my restaurant. 

I took the video straight to his employer, and told him I was extremely disappointed with his behavior. I told him I wanted to share it on Facebook, but decided to take it to him before I tarnished his business with his employee's behavior. 

His employer agreed that his behavior was unacceptable and embarrassing, and assured me that he will never work there again.

Last night I went home feeling accomplished. But then I just couldn't sleep. I had a flashback when I was 14 years old working in the kitchen during summer vacation with my dad. I asked him why he refused to fire an asshole employee of his. He told me that this guy was really good at his job, and even assholes have families to feed. Now this is just really weighing on my conscience, and I'm wondering if I made the right choice."	Not the A-hole	0	0

During our orientation the question of availability and how to request time off got brought up for the first time. Afterwards
 I told my manager that I had a family vacation a month 1/2 from now and just asked if they could give me the time off. (Just a week, Unpaid time off that is obviously). This is a vacation that has been planned for months in advance and that I already had paid for plane tickets for. The manager said she will think about it and that company policy is not so lenient with new employees taking time off. This seemed really strange but I just said okay and no problem.
 
Fast forward a week into my job, and I asked her again and she said she is still not sure. I didn’t really say anything in response b/c she’s my manager but I need to know soon and I feel like this is not fair and this is my family I’m leaving out to dry by not knowing for sure.

He was going through a rough time but his ex was struggling the most(also a good friend of mine) I hated to see how he would treat her and after an incident with the other girl(he showed up at her house via stalking her on snap maps, and her mother had to tell him to leave or they'd call the cops) and that led to the girl avoiding him. Now he was labeled as a creep, pushed away his closest group of friends, and was taking out all of his sorrows on his ex. 
Another incident happened in a co-ed gym class, where he lost his shit on another one of my friend's sister and some words were said. I looked at that and thought of how I may have reacted if something like that happened to my little sis, and I thought it would be healthiest if me and bestfriend parted ways.

c69u8r	2019-06-27 19:28:46	matiuhhh	AITA for trying to keep a friend out of a specific relationship?	"PLEASE READ FOR CONTEXT.  I’ll try to keep this brief, but in case you don’t have the time, there’s a TL;DR at the bottom. 

In actuality, this is more like a “Are We The Assholes” instead of just AITA. My entire group of friends is involved in this.  Here are the main players in the story: S, an ex-friend I used to be very close with; K, a part of our friend group who used to be best friends with S; D, a friend of some of my friends in the group; and C, a friend closer to D than I am.

A few years ago, S put K and I through some hell. I won’t go into specifics, but S’s manipulation and borderline emotional abuse resulted in K and I experiencing dissociation, depression, MAJOR body image issues, trust issues, and other things I’m not allowed to go into on this sub.

Suffice it to say, me, K, and the rest of our friend group are trying to keep S out of our lives.  Unfortunately, not everyone realizes what S is really like.  D has had a crush on S for YEARS, and at first, everyone thought S just wasn’t interested.  Then, K checked S’s twitter.  

Here’s a paraphrased version of S’s tweets: 

“i love messing with the same boy who’s been chasing me for years. he thinks i’m a goddess.  i love playing with his emotions, it’s so much fun. i know it’s horrible but it gives me such a high to have him so close to catching me and then pulling back when he thinks he has me. maybe this time i’ll let him get me.”

When K shared this, we all knew it was about D.  S is bipolar, so when they’re manic, they’ll sometimes be unable to control what they say, but this level of narcissism and sociopathy boggles my mind.  As a group, we decided it would be best to show D the tweets and warn him about our experiences with S before getting into a relationship.  

C decided to talk about them with D.  When she did, D got upset (understandably). Evidently, D and S still got into a relationship, and S found out that we (as a group) were looking at their twitter even though the majority of us are blocked (none of us really ended our friendships with S all that well).  S wrote a few more tweets afterward along the lines of, “even if you hate me, please don’t try to ruin my relationships, i feel like i finally have something good”.  I’m really hoping S has changed for the better and those original tweets were just the product of her mania, but being manic doesn’t in any way excuse that kind of behavior, so I have my doubts.

TL;DR: A manipulative asshole [S] my friends and I used to know is in a relationship with another one of our friends [D], and we’re worried about his emotional well-being due to our experiences and tweets S wrote talking about how they loved messing with D’s emotions.  We showed D the tweets and tried to warn him about S.  They got into a relationship anyway.  Are we the assholes here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c69tlh	2019-06-27 19:27:14	pifubew	AITA for moving out after telling my roommate I would be interested in moving to a new place together with her because I lost my job?	"I (22F) moved in with Anna (26F), in Feb 2019. She initially lived in the apartment alone, but was really happy when I asked if I could move in with her, and even offered to let me 1/3 of the apartment’s total rent because (1) she knew I was struggling and (2) she just wanted someone to move in with her. 

About Anna: She hates being alone and has repeatedly told me that she would like to live with me. We met in early 2019 friends for about 1.5 years now. She is open about her co-dependent tendencies and comes from a very wealthy family.

In February, I move in with her because I have a 2-month contract job that ends mid-April. She gets the bedroom and I get the couch in her living room. I open up to her about how stressed I was, and that come mid-April, I’d move back home with my parents if I didn’t get a job.

My manager at my job keeps extending my contract week-by-week. I tell Anna about this: the position doesn’t have an exact termination date, I was being considered for a full-time position, but nothing for sure.  

In mid-May, Anna proposes that we start looking for a two-bedroom apartment together. I tell her I will not move into a new apartment if I do not get a full-time position. I cannot afford to pay rent if I am unemployed and will move back in with my parents. I reiterate this point multiple times, but Anna insists that she cannot live on her own. She says she will extend the lease until the end of June so we can have time to look for an apartment.

In mid-June, my manager tells me they have found a full-time replacement for the position I was temporarily filling, and that my last day will be June 28th. I get home from work that day intending to tell her, but she beats me to the conversation and asks if I’m free that weekend to look at a two-bedroom apt that she found online (nearly twice my budget). Immediately, I tell her the truth about my news with my job and that I would move back home as soon as it ended.

Anna turns cold and tersely says its fine, and that she will continue to look for a place for herself. She tells me she will stay in the apartment until the end of July and then move out. I assume this is all fine, but she seemed upset, so I confront her and say, ‘You’re my friend, and if you’re upset about anything, we can always talk about it.’ She says everything is fine.

Anna is clearly still upset and doesn’t talk to me at all, which is out of character for her. I don’t know what to do, and honestly am too stressed out to be particularly bothered, but I am slightly hurt. We always talked about how we would help each other out in times of stress/need, but her treating me this way when I’m losing my job and my security makes me feel like she is being selfish.

**TL;DR**, I lost my job and have to move out, and consequently cannot move in to a new apartment with my friend/roommate. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

We already have a 6 year old so we have been planning to buy a house (we’re currently renting an apartment)  the only problem is that we aren’t really saving money for the down payment. 

Right now, I’m the only one bringing in a paycheck. My husband wanted to focus on finishing school so he quit his job at a clinic. 

I didn’t really mind because I make enough to support the family, but with little money left to save and the money we do have saved will be used during my maternity leave. 

My in-laws offered to take us in while we save money. We would have a bedroom for us and one for the kids, they would take care of the kids while we work or even want to just go out. They don’t even want us to pay rent, just help with chores. All they want is for us to save money. 

There’s a catch though, we can’t bring our dog. They already have 3 dogs and definitely don’t want another. My husband is totally opposed to this. I love my dog too but I feel like we have to do whats best for our kids. My sister offered to find good owners but my husband will not even think of giving him away. 

So AITA for trying to convince him to give our dog away for what I think will be the better for our family? 

tldr; my husband and I are having trouble saving money to buy a house for our growing family, in-laws offered us their house rent free so we can save but we can’t take our dog. Husband is totally opposed to the idea but I want to take the offer.

EDIT: we have had the dog for only 5 months. We were both working when he got him so I didn’t see an issue but later he quit his job because “school and work are too stressful”

EDIT: I am not going to FORCE him to get rid of the dog. I was just suggesting it to him. If he won’t change his mind then I’ll support his decision."	Asshole	0	0

c69q46	2019-06-27 19:19:20	Assholioalltheway	WIBTA if I talked to a friend about giving up a family pet that he asked me to look after while he is away.	"Throw away and some altered meaningless details here because of the sensitive subject manner here.

A friend of mine, married with a young child, asked me to check in on a dog while he and his family go to visit family for several days and would compensate me for the time.  I assume they are taking the other family dog who is much better trained and behaved and able to tale a car trip.  The dog I was asked to watch is a small dog but aparently has never been properly house trained.  It spends most of it's time in a limited indoor pen because it tends to poop and pee wherever it likes without even going near a door.

I do not feel comfortable just checking in and making sure there was plenty of food and water once a day and getting paid for it.  I do not have the time, nor was I asked, to clean up inside or take the dog for a walk or give it a bath.  Dog isn't abused, and is regularly bathed and what not.  However, I love animals (like a lot of reddit) and feel the dog is not in a good position and all would be better off if they found the dog a better home.  One with a yard so it could be outside and not get itself covered in excrement as much as well as just not be stuck in a pen most of the day.  Also, it's not hygienic for a home with a young child to have a dog constantly pooping and peeing in a penned off area of the home.

I do not want to alienate my friend and there isn't abuse and I would never suggest there was. However, it seems it would be beat for them and the dog to find it a new home.  There have been efforts to have a family member take it who are in a better situation to care for it but that fell flat.

So, WIBTA if I take my friend aside and get real about the dog and the situation?  Would I be better served to just decline the help and mind my own business? I do not want the friendship effected.

My friend has always been high-strung but in the last year she's gone from being at a 7 to a 17. Everything is about her. In her defense, she's facing some health problems but every conversation is about her, the wedding, her job, her computer, her cats, etc.

We no longer talk, she just texts me random facts about her life (""Dyed my hair!"", ""Lost 2 lbs!"") and I've stopped responding because this is not how you make a conversation happen. I've re-read our texts over the last year and the only times she's actually engaged me in conversation is to ask how tall I am so she can figure out how to arrange the bridesmaids at the wedding and when I can pick up a table from her house\*. Everything else is The Friend Show, 24/7.

Frankly, I am exhausted. My friend used to be funny and, even if she was a lot to handle, she was supportive and loving. That's all changed. I called her once to ask her about a trip she was going on. She ranted for 30 minutes and hung up. She did not once ask how I was doing. She told her future SIL that she couldn't go on an all-expenses-paid trip because it meant SIL wouldn't be at the bachelorette party. Every time she texts or addresses the group chat, I feel intense dread, bitterness, and resentment.

She hasn't done anything overtly Bridezilla, it's just an accumulation of exhausting self-centered behavior. I'm tired of catering to the Prettiest Princess at the Ball and frankly, I'm doing wedding stuff all day tomorrow and Saturday\*\*. WIBTA if I make my excuses and don't go to the bachelorette?

\*The table thing is particularly irritating because she texted a week prior to say that she was getting a new table and didn't need my old one anymore. She said there was no rush to pick it up. Then she texted while I was in night class asking if I could get it that evening and if not then, when, because it's taking up space in her house. This was during finals week.

\*\*This is another thing. She has failed to communicate at all about her expectations/schedule. I texted to say I'd only attend half the bachelorette due to work tomorrow and she asked if I was coming to the rehearsal. When I said yes, that I'd be at the restaurant at 7, she said ""No, the rehearsal is at the church at 3 on Friday."" This is the first I've heard of it and that was last week.

When I texted about hair, she told me that I needed to make an appointment. It's an early wedding so I called a salon and got their first appointment of the day. When I told her about this, she said ""No, that's too late. You need to be at the church at <2 hrs before the wedding> dressed and ready to go for pictures."" Again, this was the first I was hearing of this and that was also last week.

c69kdk	2019-06-27 19:06:33		AITA for not going to my best friends military graduation?	"Me and this friend have been best friends for two years. We hung out almost every single day, went on vacation together, I was there for their biggest heart break (which is why they joined) I was supportive of them joining, they helped me learn to be less introverted and not be the ‘quiet girl”and helped me get over my abusive ex boyfriend. 

Like I said when they joined I was supportive, made sure this is what they really wanted and spent as much time with them as I can. Also while they’re were at boot camp we wrote each other back and fourth. After they left I managed to buy my first car, and then after that my father left my mother and my family got evicted from our home. Leaving is to live in a cramped house, with some of my extended family while our stuff is either in storage. So now I’m helping to take care of them. This means I couldn’t afford a ticket to fly to the graduation. 

When my friend got their phone back the day before graduating, they Facebooked, tweeted, but didn’t text me, and posted a picture with out mutual friend “Alan” who did go to see them, saying their with their best friend. I didn’t think much of this so I texted them asking how boot camp was and the answers were very dry. We sent about three texts back and fourth each and I said how proud I was and no response, even though they’re still on their phone. They never asked how I was, which I totally understand, it wasn’t about me, but I didn’t get to explain why I couldn’t come. 

Am I just a bad friend?? I feel like maybe I should have worked some more OT and gone, or waiting to buy a car or something. They’re not back yet so I can’t be 100% sure if they’re mad but I’m pretty sure they are, the texts usually aren’t dry at all. Idk I’m torn between feeling guilty and feeling like I did the right thing by looking out for me and my family first."	Not enough info	1	0

c69hpm	2019-06-27 19:01:01	noot_gunray	WIBTA if I insisted that my girlfriend come to my brothers' wedding?	"My gf and I have been together for a number of years now. She is Muslim and I am non-religious (catholic by upbringing). My brother and his fiance moved across the country a few years ago, and now their wedding is coming up this fall. Since they moved so far away, my brother and soon-to-be SIL decided to have a very small, intimate wedding with only the immediate family and their SO's. We are all planning to fly out since it's going to be held out in the mountains and we are all staying in cabins for the whole weekend to make the most of the trip. My parents are paying for our flight and accommodation. 

Here's where the issue starts. My gf's parents know about me and we get along really well, but she is not allowed to stay overnight with me. Because of this, my gf is scared that her parents will not allow her to go to the wedding. Her parents aren't super strict, but they are *very* controlling over her (this is just a cultural thing, Muslim families tend to be very tight in this way). She hasn't even asked her parents if they will let her go since they obviously won't approve, but today she told me that she isn't going to ask and said she decided she won't be coming saying that, if she were to come it would need to be kept secret from her family (which she doesn't want to do). 

I get that the cultural differences between our families are complicated and both sides need to respect cultural boundries, but ffs it's my brother's wedding! I really want here to be there. Only 14 people are coming to the wedding, so if she doesn't come it will be extremely noticeable. So, would I be the asshole if I insist that she (at least) ask her parents about it? Keep in mind that if she does ask them, it will cause a massive argument and put a large strain on my gf both from extra stress and tense home-life.

c69fuj	2019-06-27 18:56:40	keepmeworm	WIBTA if I didn't show up to work even though I'm on the schedule?	"So me and my boyfriend started dating while school was in session and now we're on summer break and since we live in different states our summer has been pretty tough with us not being able to hang out in person that much.

Recently we made plans to hang out over the weekend and it's the last time I'll be able to spend the night at his house for a while because starting next month he'll have family staying with him the entire month (he can't stay at mine because of housing issues I'm having right now). I put in a request for Friday and Saturday off on Thursday. Well apparently the requests had to be in by Wednesday but I didn't know. I assumed they just had to be in before the schedule was made.

When the new schedule was put up they only gave me Saturday off. I told the manager who was there on Monday that I wouldn't be able to come in Friday because I would be out of town and the plans have already been made. She said she'd tell the manager who makes the schedule for me because she wasn't in that day. A few days go by and the schedule still says I work Friday. Today I get told by the main manager that my request was declined because it wasn't put in before Wednesday. But honestly my ""request"" wasn't really a request it was more of me literally telling them I wasn't coming in because I would be out of town. I told them this well over a week before the new schedule was made and they still refuse to give me the day off. 

I can't just go to work that day and then leave because I work night shift and wouldn't be out until 12am. My boyfriend has a job too so it's hard for us to both get the same days off to see each other.

 Would I be the asshole if I don't show up to work that day and go visit my boyfriend for the weekend?

Edit: (Update) talked to the manager while at work today (I'm on break) and she was pretty upset (understandably) and lectured me and told me not to do it again but ultimately ended up getting my shift covered. Thanks everyone for the replies + advice."	Asshole	0	0

c69evk	2019-06-27 18:54:32	fisheyegrey	AITA for not being open to my family?	"TL;DR I live 10 mins from my family, but I never tell them details of my life or my thoughts. I tend to get irritated when they ask about my life or avoid topics about myself.

Since high school, I never liked discussing my life with my family. I never really told them about who I like, dated, or seen romantically. My family knows 3 friends I've had since middle school who are my cousins, but I made new friends in high school and uni, but I only mention my 3 friends. If I do share something I did with my other friends, I just swap out the names, so it sounds like I'm only hanging out with them. I've dated guys (I'm gay) in high school, uni, and after uni, but my family doesn't know I'm gay; I suspect they suspect, but when topic goes to romance or my plans for family I avoid/change the subject. I don't feel frightened of what they'll do, I'm sure they'll still care about me, but I would hate to have them think about my love life or ask if I like this guy or that guy, or ask me anything about my romantic or sexual life. I live on my own, so when they ask what I do at home, I say ""reading"" and punctuate it with silence. When I think about my life, I imagine my future, I don't really picture my family. It's not that I resent them or dislike them; we have very little in common. When we hold conversations, I feel my body language changing. I can't maintain eye contact, I shift my legs away (knees facing away, usually to the exit), I fold my arms across my stomach, I don't smile, I flinch from hugs because I hate physical contact with my family (when I do, I feel ""wrong"" like i'm doing something sexual), and I can't stand the small sounds (breathing, eating, snoring) so I listen to music when I visit my family. On day trips with family (even if one family member like my mom), I feel exhausted mentally and withdraw the next day because I know I can't ""deal"" with them. With my friends and other people, i can stand physical contact, eye contact, and I find it easier to smile. Again, my family isn't loud, demanding, or manipulative. I just can't seem to give a straight, honest answer and find physical contact with them dirty. I had a therapist (for bipolar disorder) who said it sounded like a toxic environment, but I just don't see it that way; he suggested setting up boundaries, which I have. I allow no family in my house or visits without notice. I plan to move out of state next year, and I feel losing contact with my family is just okay to me. I'm sure it will hurt my family's feelings (they like it when I visit daily), but I just don't feel the same way.

AITA for not reciprocating my family's affection? That I tend to lie and omit details of my life because I don't want them thinking about my life, but can't explain this aversion to my family when I'm considering just leaving them next year?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c69egp	2019-06-27 18:53:35	rham17	Aita for accusing my boyfriend of breaking toilet seats because of the way he shits?	So my boyfriend, who is english-born half Chinese, and squats on the toilet when he poos. We've been living together in two different rented houses for two years,  and in that time 3 toilet seats have broken. Me and my housemate think that it's due to my boyfriend squatting on the seat, and I've brought this up with him. He denies this, and claims that it's a racist thing to say because it's a cultural thing as the majority of Asian people poo this way. He also says that he's never broken a toilet seat before in his life, although I'm not sure I believe him. Is this really a racist assumption to make? I should add that this isn't a breaking point in our relationship,  neither of us are particularly bothered by this, but I would like to know who is in the wrong in this situation.	Not the A-hole	0	0

c69eav	2019-06-27 18:53:14		AITA? Daughter topless in pics on school IG acct and I want to take up the issue with the administration rather than the teacher	"Main because it's not like a terrible thing and on a computer so no apologies & formatting errors are non-attributable.  No TL;DR b/c character count issues.

So I was just scrolling through my child's class IG account and noticed some photos from their water playtime on Tuesday. I had received an email about Tuesday being water day (where they wear swimsuits and play in water) and it's unclear if her mom, who takes her on Tuesdays, received it at all. Regardless, she was not taken to school with a swimsuit.  I don't know who is responsible (whether my kid or the teacher) but my child participated in the activities topless. Not a huge fan of that, but it's not really the issue, I would rather she had participated shirtless than had to sit on the sidelines clothed while everyone else had fun. 

One of the teachers took photos of this event and she's in a couple of pics among the group of children topless. One shot from the front, one where you can only see her back and posted them on the class IG account. She is the only child dressed this way and while I can't confirm it's the case for every male child the ones photographed are all wearing swim shirts.

My issues are: 
 - (1) these photos have to be taken down immediately and it is wholly non-negotiable. You can do what you want with your kids and social media, I do not care. I would not have posted these, so no one else is going to. Period. It's not that they are indecent (they aren't) it's the downside risk I'm not willing to take on. 
 - (2) someone should have said something at pick-up on Tuesday, not necessarily because she participated topless just as a reminder about water day so we can bring the right stuff next week

Where me and her mom disagree is who these issues should be addressed to (both in agreement as to the issues themselves). I say the administration because I think they should be aware of this. She says the teacher because she's actually the one with the IG account access. Either way the teacher will have to be informed to actually delete the photos, it's just a question of who will be the one informing her.

I think my ex-wife is overly sensitive but she's probably not wrong that this is a tenuous position for the teacher who is both very new to the school and a religious and ethnic minority in our area. I have no desire for her to be punished nor do I think she should be (and I would tell the administration this directly), I just simply do not care if she is. To me this is a broader issue regarding judgment and I think the school administration should know and it's plausible they never will if the issue is addressed directly to the teacher. So, AITA for wanting to tell the school directly even if the teacher loses her job over something I don't think she should?"	Asshole	1	0

I see this pup as my child and want to be there for all the firsts (like swimming, going to the beach) just like a child as I'm not sure if we will be able to have our own children. About a week ago, the mother in law had a bunch of family up and were swimming. I was at work so my wife went up to visit and took the pup. They all pressured her to let the pup swim and she repeatedly told them that I wanted to be there for the first time. They kept asking her until she gave in. She then sends me videos of the pup swimming and of course I was hurt. I told my wife how I felt disrespected and how they should have at least asked me. She told me they didnt ask because they knew I'd say no, and now, the in laws are saying they've lost respect for me and expected me to be fine with it.

c69da0	2019-06-27 18:50:53	halloweenheaux	AITA for agreeing with my boyfriend that texting him sucks?	"Texting my boyfriend (20M) is an absolute nightmare for me (20F). He has an awful habit of sending me totally random and often nonsensical texts with no context (check out my post history for a more in-depth description) and expecting me to decode what he’s trying to tell me. On top of that, every single day he complains about things that are no big deal and goes way too far dragging out the issue. Whether it’s being asked to clean up at work or having an appointment rescheduled, he acts like it’s the end of the world and texts me nonstop complaints. The conversation is never about me, it’s always about him and his anxieties and what’s going on in his life. He goes off on tangents, makes random comments derailing otherwise normal conversations, and texting him just feels like a miserable chore. When we’re together we get along a lot better but now that school is out we live too far away to see each other often and most of our communication is through text. I don’t know why he can’t figure out how to communicate with me through text as naturally as he can in person.

Yesterday, we were having a conversation about a movie. He couldn’t remember the name of the movie and we were trying to figure it out. Right in the middle of the conversation he sent “Car fire ahead”. I asked him what he was talking about and he said “Oh I’m driving and I just saw a sign that said that”. What the fuck? It was so random and totally out of nowhere. He must have been able to tell from my response that I was annoyed because he said “Haha sorry I’m so random, texting me must suck” and I responded “Yeah, it does.” He didn’t respond and we still haven’t spoken. It’s way out of the ordinary for him to not constantly text me so I think he’s pretty upset.

AITA here? Yes, texting him does suck. He mentioned it and I agreed. I’d like to add that we’ve discussed this before; check out the comments of the post I mentioned earlier in my post history... I followed all their advice. It’s not like this is the first time he’s hearing that I’m frustrated with the way he texts."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c69cfx	2019-06-27 18:48:58	june22106tth	AITA for stopping my roommate from unpacking at 2:00am?	"Hi! I apologize in advance, this is a long one. I have always wondered if I was the asshole and she the NAH in the situation or if ESH.

A few years ago, I lived in a triple. Roommate 1 (the person I fought with) would go to sleep at 5am-6am, and wake up at 5pm-6pm. Roommate 2 (we got along great) would go to sleep at 7pm and wake up at 5am every day and I would usually go to sleep around 11pm to 12pm and get up at 7am.

Where we ran into problems was the Roommate 1 would be stay in the room during the night, and be loud (music, cleaning, eating) and this would wake me up. I asked if she could go into the living room, she said no. I brought it up like two-three times, but same response. As a result, by the end, the semester, I was really struggling with how little sleep I was getting. I’m an extremely light sleeper, and any noise/light does wake me up instantly - I did tell my roommates this but said ‘turn on the light and sing the opera I'm cool, I'm fine, just don’t be loud over a long period of time (like an hour).' By the end, I was falling asleep in class, my mood changed, the whole works. 

&#x200B;

So, I got petty in the beginning of the next semester. Essentially, the night before classes started, 1 was unpacking at around 2:00am. I knew she needed to be unpacked before 3pm the next day (long story). I knew it’d hard to pack in the dark and she really needed to get this done right then, but I told her to turn off the lights. After thirty minutes, she blew up at me, saying that I should've waited for her to stop packing. When we spoke in person, she said I was loud during the day too, and that she had the right to use the room as she wanted. I am not proud of this, but I got pretty pissed. I told her that I literally had two hours during the day where the room was not occupied with someone sleeping and that she was being both unfair and self-centered. She got up and left after that.

&#x200B;

I am 99% sure Roommate 1 had some mental health issues (including depression). I feel like 1) maybe I could have taken my own advice and spent more time in the living room, 2) been more understanding of her mental health issues and 3) been more open to the fact that yes, she does have the right to use the room how she pleases. However, there is another part of me is annoyed that she wasn't more understanding how I felt, and how limited my access to the room was, and how I tried to be really polite and she was very much like: nah, I'm good. I'll just stay in the room.

I don't know; her hours were annoying, but maybe I should have been more flexible. (By the way, Roommate 2 could sleep through anything, didn't care one bit about any of this). So, reddit, was I the asshole?

tl;dr: Roommate 1 sleeps all day, stays awake all night; wakes me up constantly, enough to affect my life. I get petty, and we fight about it. Should I have been more understanding of her?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c69bnt	2019-06-27 18:47:10	genjaminfranklin	AITA for not wanting my roommate to play music when I'm making calls?	" 

I split with my girlfriend a few months back and my two guy friends essentially asked me to move in with them to take over for a roommate who had left. It's a 4 bedroom apartment, the 3rd bedroom is a shared office space for the 3 of us.

The persuading perk was being able to work in an office separate from the living quarters, which they enticed me with. One of my roommates is an artist manager so he listens to music often and I told them that this would be a problem because part of my job is to make business calls and that my clients are not the type to enjoy EDM in the background of a serious conversation about their business. He told me it wouldn't be a problem, he said he would wear headphones and only play music on the speakers when I wasn't making calls and he would ask me.

This has resulted in him asking me almost every ten seconds, or when he sees I've taken a pause to read an article online, to ask if he can play music on the speakers. I've had numerous follow up conversations with him saying that I can work in my room if not being able to play music in the office is a problem, or simply just stop working from home and go to my company's office to work everyday, despite that this perk was part of the arrangement. He insists that I don't have to do that and that the situation will work, and then continues to ask me every chance he gets to switch to the speakers.

He did it again today and I snapped at him saying that if it's not working he needs to tell me now, and he responded that part of his job is to listen to music. I reminded him of the previous conversations and asked if headphones would be a problem, and he said it isn't. He runs his business from here so I'm sensitive to his needs, but I feel like I'm at my wits end. I end up having to take extended breaks from the office so he can have his time with the speakers, but even when I do this he still asks me multiple times an hour to throw the speakers on.

He is going through a divorce, was cheated on multiple times, and had no support from friends. Basically, he’s in a really bad spot. When he first said he was going to marry the girl he is divorcing, everyone told him it was a terrible idea. She convinced him to move out of state with her and “start a new life”. He completely disappeared. Generally I’m the most forgiving in our group but also known as the loveable asshole because I am very critical of others when I think they’re making a mistake. However, when shit hits the wall I’m the first person there. 

Most of the friends he came back to won’t talk to him or flake last second. They have their own lives. He’s been really hard on himself trying to get back on his feet. All well and good, we talk daily and it seems like he’s on the right track. I’ve let him stay in my spare bedroom while he gets back on his feet. Overall courteous and kind, which I would expect out of someone who is staying at a friends for free. 

The other night we were hanging out and he started getting deep into conspiracy theories. 9/11 was an inside job, vaccinations could have negative repercussions - shit like that. Now he’s a smart guy so I was playing along because I thought he was being ironic. I was saying shit like yeah, we should be replica of the trade center on a small scale and reacts what happened. We should make a steel paper clip and see how fast it melts. 

The next morning he’s got all his shit packed and I came down stairs excited to see it. I asked him where he was going, thinking he’d found a place. That’s when he broke down and told me I’m the most toxic person in his life. He told me I was happy about the divorce and couldn’t understand why he wasn’t. He said I take everything as a joke and don’t care about anyone else. Said I was fake and full of shit. 

I tried to explain I was only joking. He said “The only reason you wanted me here was to make a joke out of my life.” I quickly back tracked and tried to explain I was only trying to make light of the situation. I asked him where I was gonna go, and he said “away from your toxic ass”.

I explained to him why I said what did. I told him whenever anyone is critical of his decisions or thoughts he packs up and runs off with those who agree with him. The conversation got deep, I convinced him to stay one more night until he at least had a place to go. I’m going to talk to him later today and try to sort this shit out. I didn’t think I was being an asshole... his self esteem is incredibly low right now and I’m the type of person to be brutally honest. But I like to think I’m a good person."	Not enough info	0	0

Anyway, I’ve been wanting a puppy for years but I’ve never been in a position to do so. I specifically want a puppy because I want to have all the time I can with it. The younger they are the more years I’ll have with them. I’m finally now in a position to have a puppy. I recently took a very well-paying job that will allow me to take my dog to work and also opportunities to work from home so I’ll be able to spend time training. On days when I’m unable to do that I’m in a position to be able to pay for doggie day care or a dog sitter. 

I want a dog that will fit my lifestyle. I’m active and outdoorsy and I want a companion for my trips. Therefore I want a high energy dog. I specifically want a border collie or a medium sized herding dog. They’re high energy, not too big, and not considered an “aggressive breed.” I have to consider those things because I live in an apartment. I would love to get a pit bull or a boxer but they’re restricted in most complexes. 

Living in an apartment is my hurdle for being able to adopt a border collie puppy. There’s a rescue that has them a available because a stray pregnant dog was found and gave birth to a litter that most resemble border collie mixes. I would love to adopt one but their website specifically says that they don’t adopt high energy dogs to people who live in apartments. I’m very discouraged because I don’t think they’d believe that I can actually meet their needs. I spend a lot of time outside (hiking, jogging, camping, etc). I have a job that will allow me to take my puppy to work. I have money to pay for daycare if necessary. There wouldn’t be many circumstances in which I’d be leaving a puppy home alone for extended periods of time. Unfortunately the rules of the rescue are explicit. 

If I can’t rescue a border collie puppy (or another herding dog) I will probably buy from a breeder. My friends I tell about wanting a border collie are begging me to adopt and are saying I’d be feeding into the overpopulation problem if I buy. Breeders are going to continue to breed and less pets will get adopted. I have my reasons for wanting a specific breed and a specific age. Very seldom do I see border collie puppies available for adoption and the one time I do they don’t want to adopt to me. I’d keep looking but if I can’t find a young herding dog to adopt then I’ll probably buy from a breeder. 

TLDR: I want a puppy that’s high energy breed (border collie or other herding dogs) and there are some available at a rescue but they won’t adopt to apartment dwellers. I’d be willing to buy from a breeder but my friends think I’d be a terrible human being for feeding into the overpopulation problem."		1	0

c695xd	2019-06-27 18:34:03	joeyp907	AITA for blocking my best friend/ex out of my life for sleeping with our coworkers?	"So in early December I go on a date with one of my coworkers. Things take off and within a week we are going on 1-2 dates a week, spending every hour of every day with each other, and by Christmas we were saying we loved each other. I know, that was crazy, stupid fast, but it was an intense relationship.

We both go home to our families for the holidays, having had the conversation that things were not ""official,"" but we still were incredibly close. Things got dicey during this. Twice she had something with an ex where ""it was just a peck and I backed right away"" or ""things got a little handsy."" And once she came on to one of our coworkers aggressively saying ""I'm not technically attached to anyone..."" All of these things hurt me, but I knew we were not exclusive so I thought I could just look past them. She was technically allowed to do all of this, whatever that means.

When we get back, we literally were never apart for more than an hour or two for a month, traveling and dating and everything. Near the end of January, we become official.

About a week after valentine's day she becomes pretty distant and started displaying signs that things were off. I find out later that when she was blowing off our plans, she was beginning what would be a 4 month affair with our boss. After they hook up a few times, she finally breaks up with me. I pulled pretty far away, but we still had contact about once a day. Their affair turns very serious for several months.

About a month ago he ghosts her. She comes back to me and pretty quickly we become best friends again. We are both on the same page that this will never be a relationship, but we still hangout plenty and we begin to hook up. She is pretty indiscreet about how much she is flirting with other guys around me, but we're not dating so this is technically allowed. About two weeks ago, she starts displaying signs that things were off again, and I begin to get frustrated. Last week she hooked up with a different one of our coworkers, they started talking, and this weekend she has plans to see another one too.

A few days ago I began blocking her out of my life. Not outright ghosting, but I have been deliberately disengaging with our conversations, I have avoided plans with her, everything is pragmatic and related to work. Last night we got into a serious argument when I explained how much I was hurt by her shutting me out and beginning things with our coworkers again. She kept saying how we weren't dating and how she has every right to do these things. I tried to get her to understand that this still hurts and even as a friend I don't feel she really cares if she hurts me or not. Things got quite heated and neither side relented.

To clarify, I didn't try anything until it was 100% clear she wanted to make out with me. Afterwards, I found out she has a boyfriend who had a mutual friend. I heard a rumour that they broke up after this and I feel absolutely awful. Am I in the wrong here? Should I have checked before I kissed her?	Not the A-hole	0	0

c694s3	2019-06-27 18:31:34		AITA for snapping on my roommate calling him dirty and telling him he can’t go anywhere with me before he takes a shower?	"We moved in to an apartment with another 2 guys last year. We’re all good friends that hang out pretty frequently. My roommates say I have OCD because I’m clean and organized (I don’t have OCD I just grew up in a house where everything was clean and organized). We’re also college students so we’re used to messy and dirty situations, and I knew beforehand that one of my roommates was not clean but not this bad.
He never washes anything, I always have to be washing dishes, he doesn’t even put them in the dishwasher, he just leaves them out there. He has helped sweeping and cleaning the living room and the kitchen twice in a whole year, I like to clean it once a week at least since there are four of us who regularly have guests and we have two dogs too, so it gets dirty pretty easily. His room is a mess, he has no bedsheets, is full of trash, stinks and has never cleaned his bathroom ever. The guests know they have to go to my bathroom or my other roommates bathrooms because his is disgusting. 
We’ve talked about this many times, I’ve told him it’s our responsibility to clean the apartment since we all live here, he always agrees but says he’ll clean later AKA never.
Anyways one day we all played basketball and decided we’re going to get food after we all take a shower, we all showered and he still out there dirty saying he’ll go without taking a shower. I was fed up and went off and called him out calling him dirty, that he never cleans, and that he can’t go anywhere with me if he didn’t take a shower prior especially if I’m the one driving. He defended himself saying that I was shallow and had a problem with being clean. My roommates just said I was being an asshole since that’s who he is. 

TLDR: Roommate is dirty and never cleans, we played basketball and he didn’t shower and I told him he can’t step in my car nor go anywhere with me if he doesn’t shower."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c693hr	2019-06-27 18:28:41	knightblaster01	WIBTA for shoving a motorbike parked in the middle of the road, to the side?	"I live in Bangalore, India - home to some of the worst traffic conditions and poorly maintained roads. There are several stretches where it's simply too narrow for three cars to fit side-by-side.

My wife was driving one day with her mother, and got stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on one such road. It was narrow, and had just finished raining.

One person and his girlfriend (presumably) parked his bike in the middle of the road in front of my wife's car, and went on foot to an adjacent store. And that's when the traffic signal turned green.

My wife honked at this person, who was just entering the shop. He looks, smirks, and proceeds to enter the shop.

Wife became furious, and got out of the car to give him a piece of her mind. He responded by telling her to drive around his bike. ""Everyone else's bike is parked in wrong places, and you're complaining only about me?""

She was flabbergasted by this man's pompousness. ""Are you mad? If you're doing something wrong, you're standing by it just because there are others doing the same? I don't care about them, because your bike is blocking me. Move it and park somewhere else.""

But he ignored her and went away. Finally, she ended up reversing and driving around (challenging, as there wasn't much space to circumnavigate).

Clearly, he's an A. (agree?)

If I were with her in that situation, WIBTA for waiting patiently for this guy to enter the shop, and then unceremoniously dumping his bike on the pavement (side of the road)?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c6926l	2019-06-27 18:25:49	mockedbymice	WIBTA for charging my friend 50$ for being a photographer at her party	"So my friend James and his family are throwing a huge party, over 200 people will be there. He's asked me to pictures during this whole ordeal. 

I take decent pictures (not for a living but as a hobby) but recently my camera broke down. Now, James gave me the option to use his camera but honestly, it's not a great camera at all. The party will be in a dark room/outside, mostly late in the evening/at night which means it will be dark out. I'm going to need a good camera for this which I can borrow freely off a friend of mine, no problems there.

James isn't exactly the person to take into account the effort taking the pictures is going to take. He thinks it's just pressing and button and on you go. He doesn't take into account the +-6 hours of taking pictures and the +-15 hours of editing those pictures will take.

I'm honestly fine with doing this for free. I'm not a professional and I guess it'll be their gift (I was planning on giving them money which they asked for). The only thing I'm not really fine with is paying for the gas it'll take me to pick up the camera. It's a 350 miles round trip which means about 50$ of gas. 

Sure, James has offered his family's camera but if he wants mediocre pictures, he can give the camera to someone else right? Let them take the pictures. If he wants nice pictures, I'm willing to take them but for a small reimbursement of 50$.

Reddit, WIBTA for charging my friend 50$ for taking some decent pictures of his party?

Ok so I told the promoter what we decided i told her i didn't want to let them down last minute and that i would just play out solo and just do the 6 agreed upon covers. I don't want to play our our originals WITHOUT my band members as that'd would feel wrong. WIBTA for still playing just in order to not let the festival people down?

c690y7	2019-06-27 18:22:56	xXxBringDaKush420xXx	AITA for moving out instead of putting up with my brothers shit?	"So last year, my mom had a stroke and became mentally disabled and paralyzed. I was taking my finals when it happened, and was put on academic probation shortly afterwards. My brother and I were faced with the dilemma of handling her finances. I worked at a disability law firm for a year, so the answer was obvious: sell EVERYTHING and file for government aid immediately. He responded with ""No no we can handle it"". Since then we agreed that he would pay for the mortgage and insurance. I would pay for the car and pay for all of her house fees and bills and such.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was young, 20 years old and not exactly in the best place to be making financial decisions that large. About half a year passed and I was on the verge of academic suspension, largely due to the stress of juggling working full-time, and going to school full time in two different campuses 53 miles apart. I came to my brother and told him that I couldn't handle all of the bills and he agreed to pay the car note. I got into an accident, and found out he wasn't keeping up with insurance. I was stuck at the house with no way to get to class or work. This along with the threat of foreclosure, I dropped out of school to try and figure out just how the hell I was going to pay for everything on top of my bills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fast forward to 2 months ago. I'm gearing up to start school again, but of course I can't afford it. In order to register for another chance at academic probation, I have to prove that I've changed my living situation and have moved closer to campus because that was one of the major causes for my grades absolutely tanking. I tell my brother that I have to move from the house in order to get financial aid, because I can't pay for both school and everything regarding the house. He offers me a deal. I stay in the house and pay half of the rent, he comes down and gives me an old beater so I don't have to worry about saving for a car. He never came. We did this dance about 2 more times.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yesterday, other family members sent me a text asking what they could do to help. He blocked them so I sent him a screenshot of the text and he responded "" Your rent is 10 months behind, your car payment is 10 months behind, and you will have to keep paying for all of the bills etc."". After all of this, and trying to move out multiple times because its too goddamn expensive for me to pay near $400 a month in bills for what is essentially a run down hoarder home with no a/c or hot water, paying for school, and everything, I'm looking at apartments and trying to sign a lease to get the hell out by July 2nd. But by doing this, its dropping all of the expenses on my older brother.

c68zia	2019-06-27 18:19:41	brotherthrowaway23	AITA for wishing my brother would be gone longer?	" So,  I have two younger brothers, who I'll call T and J. J is 16,  adopted, and was born addicted to cocaine. His behavior is out of control. He has ADHD,  ODD, maybe conduct disorder, and maybe other things that I'm forgetting? 

&#x200B;

He's always had problems. He's had to do a couple of stays in mental health facilities for homicidal thoughts, gotten  violent, steals, etc. I  know some of it isn't his fault. But it affected me a lot growing up. My mom would get so depressed that she  wouldn't leave her room unless it was to eat or use the restroom for  days at a time, and had to be hospitalized once. My dad would hate  coming home at night. I didn't receive the mental health care I needed because he was  using so much of everyone's energy. And then I couldn't really talk  about it because he's so charming that everyone would think I was  lying about him.

&#x200B;

In  August, though, he stole Mom and Dad's car and went on a joy ride with a friend of his, then hit and killed someone. He then proceeded to make fun of his friend for  being traumatized after she saw the body, and only cared about it enough  to be upset that he won't get his license until he's 21 and to worry  that people would find out that he killed a man and it would hurt his  reputation. It started a downward spiral. He stopped taking any of his meds and started doing things  like smoking, sneaking out, drinking, telling everyone that we're not  his real family, and one time he threw a party while Mom and Dad were  out of town and he was supposed to be staying with my grandma.

&#x200B;

This  eventually led to him spending about 3 months in juvenile hall. Him getting out made Mom's depression worse and we  worried that she'd have to go to the hospital again. He had an ankle monitor. He not only broke probation within the first 72  hours, but his probation officer eventually got so overwhelmed with him  that the person in charge of DJJ for the whole state ended  up taking his case personally. He was sent to this camp for troubled  teens. We were told that he would be there until Sept or Oct.  But he can behave himself when he wants to, and he managed to trick  everyone into thinking he can handle himself, so he'll be home in two  weeks. He can be really charming and behave himself when it  suits him. But that stops as soon as he gets home and it's right  back to the way it was before. This has happened before.

&#x200B;

So  I'm upset that he'll be home earlier than I thought. I don't mean to  sound like a terrible person, but when he's gone, it's like heaven.  Everyone is happy. We have fun as a family, there aren't any arguments,  we do normal family stuff like sitting down for family dinners and  enjoying each other's company. I honestly feel cheated. I could've  always had a happy family like that, but he took that from me. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c68y4r	2019-06-27 18:16:29	LiquidNimbus	AITA for parking so that it made it impossible for the other car to open their driver-side door?	"Okay so I went to get my haircut today and in the parking lot there were multiple spots open about 75 yards from the door and just one spot open in front of the hairdresser. The problem with this one spot was the car was parked completely outside the lines (both left wheels over the line).

&#x200B;

I said fuck it and parked there anyway but it was so tight that the driver likely couldn't open his driver side door. I could have parked my car so that it partially went over the other line, but I wasn't looking to start some sort of domino effect. As I exit the car, some stranger makes a comment saying it wouldn't have been very hard to park somewhere else. I shrugged it off.

&#x200B;

After my haircut, I go to my car and see someone put a note on my car saying ""thanks for making my kid and I fight our way into our car, dickhead."" Now my thinking is if this guy/girl parked like that it shouldn't be my fault for their struggles, but getting called out twice is making me doubt that."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

Nobody really got to sleep much either because the airport staff kept telling us to stay awake because news would come any minute and people ended up sleeping in shifts. Worst flight experience of my life so far. Plane lands at 4 am or so and at 4:30 we’re ready for take off. We’re all relieved and then about an hour onto the flight someone’s baby starts crying, very very loudly. This crying baby then woke up someone’s dog who then started howling and then another baby started crying. Parents get the dog and second child to stop crying but the first baby keeps crying so loudly it’s keeping everyone from sleeping. The parents ignore flight attendants and basically do nothing about the baby. I’ve just about had it and I told the parents they better get their kid to shut up or I’ll make him shut up and they shrug. I then scream as loud as I could at the baby and he looked absolutely terrified. Never said a word again for the rest of the flight. I kid you not half the plane started clapping (no this is not a r/thathappened ) the baby’s parents go apeshit over it telling me I traumatized their kid and I told them to stfu so we can get some rest. A reallymassive guy, 6”6 probably a body builder, steps in and says “if you have a problem with him you have a problem with me so I suggest you step down”  Onxe we landed those parents kept threatening to press charges against me and demanded my info (I denied of course) and I just wanted to know what the internet’s opinion on this situation is. 

Edit: I’d like to clarify, the child was more of a toddler than baby, there was an error translating this as English is my third language and I don’t speak it to well. I believe the child was 5. In my native language the word for toddler and baby are kind of the same"	Asshole	0	0

"I'll try and keep this as brief as possible. I've been job hunting for about a month now, I finally got a call back from two recruiters. I had an interview with each company and they both went well. Both companies appear to want me. Good news, right? Not for me.

&#x200B;

Job 1: 20 minute drive, salaried, excellent benefits, casual workplace atmosphere

Job 2: 1 hr drive, hourly pay (works out to just a little more than the other offer), unknown benefits, seemingly more strict workplace

&#x200B;

Now, I don't know why I did this, but when I was going back and forth with the recruiter negotiating pay for job 2, he asked me if I had a number where if they accepted, I would cancel with the other company and commit to his offer. I agreed, kind of. I said, verbatim, ""Yeah, that sounds fair.""

&#x200B;

He came back after that to let me know that my counter-offer for higher pay had been accepted. I have a final interview with the 1st company on Monday, and all signs point to them enthusiastically making me an offer. I know I want that job more, but I already agreed to cancel with them for the 2nd one. I am not good at conflict and I feel if I tell the recruiter for job 2 that I prefer the 1st job (and by extension, the recruiter for that job), he would take it as an insult and that I had wasted his time. He's been trying to call me this morning to get all of the paperwork in order so I can start at job 2, but I want to hold off until I know for sure with job 1. He's been very pushy, though. I get that he's a recruiter and it's his job to fill spots, but dang, dude. I just want some room to breathe and this whole going back and forth between these two companies has been really stressful.

So we have this d&d group that is transforming into a new group because of relocation. The group before was alright but I always had an issue with the DM’s gf, let’s call her T. Every session, T would be on her phone 90% of the time. I’ll admit I’ve played on my phone before but never to the point where I had no idea what was going on. She does it so much that we have to stop playing and explain everything to her. Which sometime she doesn’t even care to listen.   She’ll even leave the table and go sit on the couch and just play on her phone. She constantly gets upset whenever we try and role play and takes any criticism super personally. She really just doesn’t get the game and half the time we have to meta explain to her situations that should be blatantly obvious.
(For example, this murdering bandit that is walking away from 8 massacred bodies is going to try and murder us, even if your alignment is lawful good it doesn’t matter). She got so upset and refused to participate after. I have more examples but in short, she just doesn’t understand/want to understand role playing. It’s not like she’s new to this either, she’s been playing for several months. She just doesn’t care about the game at all and at one point made her BF (DM) level up her character for her because she didn’t want to. I don’t care if she has a hard time understanding, but she doesn’t even care to learn.

Now to the WIBTA part. Our group is breaking up so I’ve decided to recruit people off reddit for a new group including me, my bf, and the original DM. T is moving 3 hours away from where the campaign will take place so I told the DM that I don’t think we can have someone that far away in the group due to attendance issues and he agreed. I’ve told him about the people I recruited online and he seemed to be excited,
Except earlier today he mentioned adding two more coworkers to the group (making it 7 with current and new players) and I asked him if that was too many. He listed the people who he thought were playing and in that list was T. 
I don’t even know what to say, I really want to play d&d with him as the DM, but I can’t bring myself to play with her again. She makes me dread sessions and d&d is supposed to be fun. There’s also the 3 hour away thing that makes it a bad idea as well. If he insists on her playing I might have to tell him how I feel. WIBTA if I said I didn’t enjoy playing with his GF because of how she plays?


TLDR; DM’s gf is a terrible and inconsiderate d&d player that now lives 3 hours away from where sessions will be. WIBTA if I said I don’t want to play with her?"		1	0

c68s04	2019-06-27 18:02:32		AITA for distancing myself from my family?	"My family is deeply religious, and their parenting wasn’t always the best. Throughout my entire life and even today, their love was conditional as long as I was the daughter that fit their expectations. My dad only gave a fck about me if I got straight A’s, and my mom only accepted perfection “in the eyes of the lord”. 
At eighteen, I put myself on birth control because I was in my first physical relationship. To keep my family in the dark, I paid the 1,400$ out of my own pocket. Money I didn’t have but wasn’t willing to put it on my moms insurance. Well...they found out. The statement was sent to their house and they opened it (illegally I might add because only my name was on it). I was subsequently told to pack my things and leave. An hour later everything important to me was stuffed into my car and I spent the next week with my boyfriends parents. Eventually we rented a house and that’s where I am now. I’m currently 21. Eventually they tried to get me to come home and I come over to visit now and then. However it’s very clear to me what they expect. My younger sister does everything “the right way”, and a blind man would be able to see clearly who the favorite is because of it. 
And basically that’s how their parenting works. If I don’t fit their mold, no matter how responsible I am being, I am not worthy of their love. They don’t know I’m bi, and never will. But after many, many smaller incidents, such as my sister texting me one day “I don’t know what went wrong with you, but I bet it was (boyfriends name)’s trashy family”. Yeah, that one hurt. His family is the most loving in the world. But comments like that are a regular occurrence. My dad even called me a huge disappointment and a complete ass in the middle of the church parking lot during my sisters wedding. Quite loudly. His disappointment over the fact that I am an athiest. 
After being hurt so many times I have finally come to the realization that it is okay for me not to want to have a close relationship with my family. I desperately want one, but I know it will never happen. AITA for cutting ties with the people who raised me?"		1	0

The water is ice cold and the room has their A/C in full blast. It’s 90 degrees outside so stupid me, I came in shorts and sandals. Not even two cups in and I begin shaking like a leaf. I decide to pace my drinking and the nurse comes to me and goes “I can’t let you see the doctor until you finish the last cup” Ugh...I tell her I have a condition where liquid goes right through me due to having children they screwed up my bladder so I’m pacing myself but she insists that the sooner I finish the sooner I can get seen. I chug the final 5th cup and tell her. The clock hits midday and my bladder starts hurting. I need to pee. I tell her and she goes “the doctor is running behind. Sit and wait” I do as told and then it’s 12:30. I get up and tell her “listen I really need to go. My bladder is killing me and will probably pee myself in front of everyone.” She asks me when I drank the water and I tell her 10:45. She goes “who told you to start drinking so early?! You only needed to start drinking 30 minutes prior to being seen” I point to the nurse and she acts like she can’t see me and walks off.  I go “what happens if I use the bathroom” and the nurse goes “you’ll have to drink the 5 glasses again and we will move people ahead of you while you wait for maybe another hour” At this I snap and go “it’s already 30 minutes past when I was supposed to be called, I’m going to piss myself because it’s ridiculously cold in here and because one of your nurses made me start drinking this ice water way too early! And now you’re telling me if i pee I’m going to have people skip me?! In total  I’m going to be here for 4-5 hours for a 10 minute procedure?! This is fucking ridiculous!” One of the nurses hearing me causing a scene goes to the back and runs back to me saying I can go and to go ahead and pee. She then gave me a bottle of water to drink after and apologized. 

 I called and told my husband all this and he laughed. I feel like such a Karen right now...I’m a fairly tolerant so I feel guilty for snapping and raising my voice, especially at a nurse that had nothing to do with my situation . But I feel that I was justified in being angry. So...AITA?

TL;DR: I was told to drink a shitton of water then told to hold it for hours so I snapped at a nurse and ended up getting immediately seen"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c68nm0	2019-06-27 17:52:38	bilbo-swaggins69	AITA for being shirtless around my roommate's GF and refusing to stop	"Ok so some background. Ever since high school I'd walk around without my shirt or socks on when I'm just relaxing in my own home since I have hyperhidrosis and I sweat terribly through my armpits and feet and I dont like wearing damp clothes (IDK why it just really bothers me, I change socks like 3 times a day). In college I was self-conscious about my family always hounding me to eat more and put on weight so I started working out and never stopped, so I got reasonably large, as one would expect. Later, I moved in with my current roommate who at the time was single but eventually got a girlfriend. In the past I'd usually put on a shirt when I'm just chilling in the living room but I never put a shirt on when I'm hanging out in my room and I'm just leaving to grab a drink or something. When his GF first started coming over to the apartment I'd obviously make sure I looked presentable (showered, fully clothed, etc), but then she started coming over regularly and I started to get more comfortable with her. One day she was over again (at this point she started practically living here) and I finally thought ""Nah I dont need to throw a shirt on to go get a drink"". So I left my room no shirt or socks and did my business, while they watched Netflix on the living room coach. I did this throughout the day to make a sandwich or dinner or to grab another drink or something. Sometimes I'd make small talk with her like ask her how's she's doing and stuff, and then go back to my room. At the time I didn't think anything of it, but then the next day he came up to me and told me that they both thought I was trying to ""flex on him"" and hit on his GF or some shit (I'm single right now) in the douchiest/creepiest way possible. He then told me we'd have problems if I kept ""being weird around his GF"". At this point I got kinda pissed (it's not a big deal for me to throw a shirt on but just the way he approached me about it pissed me off) and told him that I'm the one who pays rent, not this semi-permanent resident of a GF so I'll walk around my apartment however the fuck I want. He thinks I'm an ass, I disagree. AITA?

Edit: For clarification, the GF wasn't like psyched about it but she wasn't really uncomfortable or too mad about it either. It was mostly my roommate who had the problem with it. Also the GF had lived in the apartment for a week straight at this point (as in sleeping, showering, and eating here) Which I honestly don't mind since it's his apartment too. Part of the reason I was mad was that I thought that should afford me the right to walk around shirtless than. I'm not sure that how that stuff works though.

Final edit: I only small talked with his GF because that's my way of being nice, since I'm not super close to her. I feel like I don't need to do the same to my roommate since I've known him for some time now, so we don't ""small talk"" all that much, maybe that's wrong though. Lastly, I only mentioned working out since I think that's part of the reason he was mad. I think he'd be less mad if I was thinner, but then again this is just my side of the story, up for your interpretation."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c68mc2	2019-06-27 17:49:26	Kriegerbursche	AITA for being angry at my mother for forcing me into being a vegetarian	"Context: I am 16 years old and live with my mother and older brother. Up until about 4 years ago my mother wasn't a vegetarian and would eat meat. Ever since she became vegetarian she tried forcing me and my brother into also becoming vegetarian and for a few months she even tried to make us vegan.

Through all of this time neither I or my brother wanted to be a vegetarian/vegan, but she doesn't care about that. She even talked multiple times about making our 2 cats vegetarians.

In my opinion everybody should choose for them selves and ONLY for themselves whether or not they want to turn vegetarian/vegan, but my mother doesn't see it like that. She thinks that she's doing the right thing forcing us.

Now we get to present day, I bought meat from MY money for myself, and put it in the fridge in the kitchen. After she realized where I had put it she started screaming at me to take it out of there or she would throw it in the trash(this part I find dumb because she is a person that allways calls people out at home at dinner for not eating everything of their table with the argument that how many people don't have the food which we waste). Right after that I get up and take it out of the fridge and put it into my mini fridge in my room(I didn't instantly put it in there because she doesn't want it to be turned on over night).
Right after that we get into a conversation where I am basically just pissed off because of her shouting at me. I tell her that I think it's shitty to force other people into being vegetarian and inhuman forcing animals into being vegetarian. This is where she tried pulling the normal ""vegetarian cards"" by that I mean that animals get killed for meat and that how could I eat meat and so on and on. Shortly after that she just grabs the meat that I bought with my money and goes to return it.

Additional info: she also pulls the ""I dont want meat in MY apartment"" card even though I feel like she can't say that because she doesn't even work, 95% of the money comes from our dad who works his ass off and also just gets shouted at by her."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c68l7y	2019-06-27 17:46:55	lizxlizx	WIBTA If I told my family I didn't want to associate with my grandfathers widow during our visit next week?	"Context: My grandfather  cheated on his first two wives (my bio grandma being his second.) He married my grandma  when she was 17 and he was in his late twenties. He then met the third wife (M) years later and cheated on my grandmother with her, both M and my grandfather leaving their spouses for each other. I'm told my grandfather was also a well known philanderer during his time as a CHURCH DEACON, so he didn't just cheat twice.

Growing up I was always instilled with confidence and told I should never settle for someone who wouldn't put me first. It came as a huge shock to me when a relative told me that my grandparents hadn't just divorced, my grandfather had cheated on my grandma. My parents, brother and I live in the U.S while the rest of the family live in the U.K, so my brother and I were disconnected from most of the family. Unfortunately my grandfather was dying of cancer when I found this out, and while I thought he was a scumbag, I didn't want to hurt my mother by creating a scene.

He died March of this year, so this is the first time I'll be seeing the family without his presence. I found out that M wants to spend a day with my parents, brother and I. I'm pretty angry at the fact people are even entertaining continuing a relationship with someone who was fine with emotionally destroying my grandmother, and since I'm nineteen now I should be able to decide who I spend time with.

WIBTA if I told my relatives I didn't want to see M nor have a relationship with M for the above reasons? Since his death is so recent and he's still my mothers DAD would I just cause more unnecessary suffering?

Am I overreacting? Because I'm so far away from them should I be asking more questions to get both sides?

&#x200B;

EDIT 1 INFO: My grandmother is also to blame for her part in cheating with my grandfather on his first wife. I just think that since she was a teen and he was a decade older when they married that she was probably groomed for a year or two beforehand. 

I'm coming to the conclusion that my anger towards my grandfather was redirected to his widow upon his death, and that I need to rethink how I feel about her. She's not innocent for her cheating but my grandfather's the one who hurt my family with his repeated transgressions."	Asshole	0	0

c68jhr	2019-06-27 17:43:02		WIBTA For telling my mom that my step dad jerks off to Hentai in the kitchen night?	"There's a few background details about how this came about, but aren't wholly relevant for this sub. To cut a long story short, at 1am I walked in on my step dad jerking off to Hentai. What makes it worse, is earlier that day I had said to him and my mom that I would be popping in and out of the kitchen that night because I wasn't sleeping well, but will make sure to be super quiet so I don't wake up either of them (whose room is above the kitchen) or my two little brothers (around 8yo). They both acknowledged this conversation.

So a bit about the layout of my house. There four bathrooms, one which is in my mom and step dad's room. There two living rooms, one that's never used and the other which my brothers play in. We basically spend all of our time in the kitchen/dining room.

My step dad has his huge computer screen set up so that it faces the kitchen door (which is slightly blurred glass). You can see where this is going: a few nights ago I walked in at 1am, and seen this massive image of a naked Hentai girls ass and vagina, he rapidly hunched over and closed the screen. I acted like I seen nothing, made a drink, asked for a smoke, and went back to bed. 

I was fucking fuming. He *knew* I was going to be in and out of the kitchen that night, and my brothers are well known for sneaking in to try and get their video games, or a glass of water at night time. There were *five* other empty rooms he could have gone into. But no, he jerks off in the hub of the family home, with the screen facing the door.

I'm worried about saying it to my mom, because me and my step father basically don't speak, and the few times we have in the past few years has been over disagreements and he always brings my mom into it to talk for him. I don't want it to come off as anything to do with my passionate dislike of the man, but it's just fucking gross in itself, let alone the fact I said I'd be coming in, and the fact that my brothers often sneak in too. I only come home a couple night a week to visit, so I'm not sure it's my place to be stamping down rules there, but it's just disgusting, so disrespectful, and realistically very irresponsible for him to do that in full view of anyone walking into the room with two young kids.

I gave him $40 and said to get me whatever that would cover. He did, however he only brought me back one item that only cost $15, and didn't make any mention of change. It's been several weeks and I have thought of a plan to get my money reimbursed. I don't like confronting this person because it always turns into an ordeal and I am the type who just likes to avoid any argument at all costs. Continuing, I am in charge of paying the utilities for our house, so everyone sends me money through Venmo. So what I ended up doing was adding the remainder of the change from the $40 I gave him to each of his utilities payments, so he just unknowingly paid about $7 more than everyone else. Am I the asshole for doing this, or is he the asshole for not giving me my change?		1	0

I park my car in front of my house, next to my neighbors porch and their is a small pathway down to the landing where my house is. All of this is considered ""my land"". I come home to other day and there is clothes line put up from the neighbors porch connecting to a tree I own, and their dirty clothes are hanging down over the one path to get into my house. I promptly left a note saying I felt it was inappropriate and rude, and told them to take it down tomorrow or I would be happy too. The next day as I am getting home from work, I see them on their deck so I remind them to take the line down and how I feel it is disrespectful. My neighbor who is a 33 year old women, begins sobbing on the spot, saying that that clothes line has been up since she was a kid, and then comments about how ""you haven't even been alive for 30 years let alone lived here for thirty years"". I was pretty shocked by her reaction, especially the crying. After a 10 minute conversation that went no where, I just left and took it down and told them if it went up again I would take it back down. For the past couple of days whenever I see her she gets teary and emotional and says I am a ""bully"". She gives off hand petty remarks like ""if you were so mature you would've used proper punctuation and capitalization in your note or talked to me and my family man to man"" Did I handle this wrong? I feel this was a very blunt, direct and sensible request on my part. I am pretty confused by the all around response I got and feel they are trying to take advantage of me because of my age and being new, and weren't prepared for any resistance. I am a 22 y/o male."

c68gx7	2019-06-27 17:37:15		AITA for asking my roommate to pay more rent?	"Ok so I’m in college living in an apartment with 5 roommates. The apartment has 4 rooms so 4 guys share rooms and me and another guy have our own. This is important because we determined rent prices based on sharing a room or not, where I was paying $170 more than the sharers for the luxury.

Anyway the school year ended and 4 of the guys moved out. They still pay their rent just fine but now we have run into the situation where me and my current roommate have the same living situation, but I am still paying $170 more than him. I talked to the other guy also paying more and he said he didn’t care, he will continue to pay it through the summer. That is fine.

I cared however, so I approached my current roommate and asked if he could pay an extra $50 of rent this month (would have been $85 if we split the extra $170 evenly but I was being nice). He said no since he still has the possibility of sharing whenever his roommate comes back to visit this summer (1 night so far in 1.5 months). I told him that is ridiculous and does not constitute a $170 discrepancy but he kind of just wasn’t giving me the time of day and wasn’t budging. Also, we have extra rooms so even if he does come back they don’t have to share!

c68gfw	2019-06-27 17:36:11		WIBTA for offering a homeless guy $20 to be tased	Had this debate with my friends since we’ve recently acquired a handheld, somewhat cheap taser. Basically we have a bunch of homeless dudes that live near us always asking for money. Since we’ve gotten the taser, as a self defense tool, I’ve been offering my friends $20 to try out the taser on themselves, but nobody wants too. I don’t plan on actually doing it on a homeless guy because of the obvious liability that could occur by tasing a stranger, but most importantly I don’t want to see somebody get seriously hurt unless they were posing a threat to us. We want to test it to make sure it will actually be a useful self defense tool.  I was really thinking if you ignored that issue ( I know a big issue) it treaded on the line of asshole or NTA. The homeless guy could obviously use the money,, but the method doesn’t really feel right. The situation is something I would offer to a friend at the same price for the same amount of effort, and is a pretty fair price for a something that most likely would only hurt for a few seconds (this also isn’t like a police grade taser it’s a somewhat cheap one that isn’t crazy powerful). But at the same time it feels like it is taking advantage of someone’s situation for a cheap thrill. It also wouldn’t be someone who doesn’t have the mental capacity to understand what they’re doing, but a fully knowledgeable consenting adult.

c68foa	2019-06-27 17:34:19	brenn34	WIBTA if I defaulted on a personal loan from a potential stalker?	" 

Many years ago I met a cool person at a party and we went on a date. Nice, funny, smart, good job (tech bubble), perfectly fine in the looks department. But we did not “connect” on the level I need for romance. So I quickly let them know I thought they were great, and I wanted to be friends only. I could not have been clearer (or nicer!) about it. I promise you, I did not lead this person on. There was zero ambiguity.  
The person agreed, and I thought we had a friendship. For years.  
We dated other people and broke up with other people, saw each other through family deaths and pet deaths, helped each other move, the whole thing. Several years into our friendship, I was in a jam and they loaned me a chunk of money that was significant to me, saying “pay back what it's worth to you.” So I always intended to pay it back at least two-fold (ten-fold in my lottery-winner fantasies) in small payments.  
Turns out I am not great at making money, so I have probably paid back about 25% of it by now. They never made me feel bad about it or indicated a hardship. I really thought it would be paid off sooner.  
But a few years after the loan, now several years deep into this “friendship,” I realized this person was never going to stop trying to date me. We lived in different cities by this point, and when they came to visit for a few days, they spent the whole time aggressively trying to act like boyfriend/girlfriend, with gross lingering eye contact and unwanted caresses. It grew more and more uncomfortable. Then something blew up, it's been so many years I don't remember exactly, but I wound up literally chasing them out of my apartment and yelling, and told them to stay away for good.  
Aside from me sending them a few chunks of money once or twice, we have not communicated since.  
More than 20 years since our one and only date, more than ten years since I banished them from my home for years of relentlessly pushing for date number two while pretending friendship, they just now found me online, and they just casually messaged me saying they're coming through town. As if a breezy little catch-up visit would be a perfectly natural thing.  
It made me feel like this person still Just Doesn't Get It. So I blocked them.  
I think they're loony and I don't feel safe.  
But there's still this debt. I always intended to repay it, but now I feel like even a check in the mail or a paypal alert is going to be seen as encouragement to keep this sick dynamic alive.  
Am I an asshole if I just go 100% no-contact, even including the money? I just feel like there's no other way to protect myself.  
I can make all the excuses I want, about the times I've loaned money and not been paid back, about the real pain they caused me by not actually being a friend after all. Or maybe 25% of the amount is “what it's worth” to me after all. But what I really need is to fade out of this person's consciousness forever.

So, my brother is a huge fan of bob the builder and mickey mouse.
My parents, especially my mother buy present for him quite often maybe it is partly also from jealousy, because when I was younger I could choose a few of the birthday presents I got and the rest would be given away to other people when it was their birthday (we are not poor btw, so it wasnt because of poverty). Apart from birthdays I also rarely got presents (which I dont mind because I hate getting presents. It makes me feel in debt to them).

Anyway, my biggest reason for not buying him anything is because he already has all the toys he has.
He litteraly has all bob the builder toys. 4 TIMES! 
I am not even kidding he litteraly has most toys 4 times. They are in diffrent sizes and my mom already told me that my dad would buy a whole box of those toys again (he buys the boxes from a second hand site).
He also already has all the Mickey Mouse toys he wants.

My mother asked me why I didnt give him money so he could go to the store and choose somethings, but I honestly dont want him to have anymore toys. I think that it is rediculous to have this many toys and that most of them should be sold so that he doesnt have every toy 4 times.
If I gave him money to choose a toy while he has so many toys already he wouldnt play with it anyway, so I just see that as a waste of money.

Also, I dont know if it matters, but I dont live with my parents.

I confronted him. He denied it. Over and over and over and over again. Saying he was hacked. 
There was no way he told her details about his day only he can know. Finally he admitted it. 
I'm stupid I already know this. I've decided to stay and work it out because I feel this is my fault. I'm obviously lacking something or he wouldnt have needed to go to another girl again. 

Anyways I'm rambling. His ""boyz"" are upset hes deleting his discord. When it happened before he just told them he was talking to a girl in a way he shouldn't. This time he told them the hacked excuse. I feel like...even though I dont want our family to know. I dont like that he's downplaying his actions. I want them to know exactly what he did to our family. He says he doesn't want his friends to hate him.  I know I should leave him but I'm just not strong enough right now. 

TD;LR AITA for wanting to tell his friends that he kept his discord for after cheating the first time that he cheated again because hes downplaying it to them?

c68ctj	2019-06-27 17:27:54		AITA for influencing my friend's school choice	So just some background. I, along with all of my friends, am currently looking for a college to study at for the next few years (live in the UK so college is where 16-18 year olds go to school). In my area, there are pretty much two colleges that you can choose from to attend (I'll just call these College A and College B). Most people go to College A, which is much closer, but early on in the process of choosing Colleges I and a good friend (who I will just call Ben), both said we wanted to attend College B. I think the fact Ben knew he would have a friend (me) going to College B alongside him influenced his decision to go, since I don't think Ben is too confident and would likely find going to a new College alone a scary experience (as would I), this means he may only have wanted to go to College B because I was also going there. Everything seemed pretty set, but recently I have completely changed my mind and want to go to College A along with the rest of my friends, I am really worried that when I tell Ben I have changed my mind, he will regret signing up for College B and be annoyed at me for possibly misleading him (I was always confident that I wanted to attend College B with him.) I honestly am unsure if I am in the wrong for saying I was sure I wanted to attend College B for so long, perhaps influencing his choice to sign up to College B, and then changing my mind and leaving him alone at College B with no-one he knows. Ben also cannot change his mind since he only signed up for College B, while I signed up for both College A and College B, allowing me to change my mind at a late stage.

However, I think what I’ve been doing to help her “fight her addiction” has become so far-reaching it’s actually becoming an enabling behavior. Also, for reference, I’m 20.

At first, helping her fight her addiction was occupying her with other activities so she wouldn’t boredom-drink. Sometimes that also meant giving her a clear idea of my work schedule (sometimes she would use not knowing when I’d be around as a reason to go to a bar). These are things I didn’t really want to do, as it limited my social life. But it was working at first.

Then it’s progressed to helping her when she’s gotten in trouble. The cops were called on her for starting shit at a bar once but let her go in my care. Instead of letting her spend the night in jail after she got arrested, she was released in my care. She attacked me at home once and someone else called the cops and she got arrested for that, and I basically begged to have the charges dropped (they were). It’s progressed to the point where I’m now trying to mitigate the damage her drinking does by driving her to get drinks etc so she’s not driving/publicly intoxicated. I have tried to dilute her drinks but she notices and that causes a different kind of trouble. 

And honestly I just want to stop. I can’t deal anymore. I love my family but it’s starting to wear on my mental well-being and eat into time I’m supposed to use for my obligations."	Not the A-hole	1	0

Introvert, kept to himself, very clean, personable to his friends and myself, etc. All of the signs of a great roommate.

We would go and get drinks, food, LAN party, go to strip clubs; typical shady roommate stuff.

So 10/10 awesome dude.

In the next couple months he became passive-aggressive and emotionally dependent on me. I would get finger snapping, eye rolling, caught him smelling my clothes, wearing my pants, sleeping in my bed while I was at work, waiting in my doorway sighing about his day, etc.

Whatevs, he was tired, wanted to see what detergent I was using, wanted to try a new brand of jeans, had a bad day. It's cool, no harm no foul.

I noticed he had more telltale signs many of my gay friends show (a lot of my good tennis friends are gay) and during a party he came out to me while I was pouring shots for the mentioned tennis team.

Roommate: ""Do you even care! I'm BI! I'm not gay, you can be so uncaring and crass.""

Me: ""Men, Women, Trans, the only thing I care about is that you drink your special medicine with everyone else so we can go to the bar""

Roommate: ""You've never cared about me. You only care about yourself, this is a big deal for me.""

My stepmom was 19 and he was 31 when they got married. My dad and stepmom were married for 40 years when he died. So the point of my question: My stepmom keeps calling me in the middle of the night, crying over missing MY dad. This really upsets me. Like, am I supposed to comfort HER because MY dad is gone?

"My parents had me when they were 19 and quite poor although they split up when i was 4ish and remarried when i was 9/10 they had me weekdays mum and weekends dads. My entire life my dad played the shout and scream untill i would cry and do a complete 180 as soon as i did, as such i cry very easily even now and it has had a negative impact on me due to the stereotypes of being a guy. 

It remained at a steady level screeming 1 time a day when i was there 2 days a week, that is until my dads business went under just after his 2nd kid with his mew wife was born and the 1st had mental problems which makes him extremely hard to take care of. The way i see it he used me as a stress reliever shouting and screaming at me every time id go there while my step mum would just watch it happen. 

Early December I accidentally broke a low hanging light in my room that hadnt been put in right years prior and i told my dad unapologetically which i now know is an asshole move he went ballistic and pushed me in the corner of the room and screamed he would beat me up all while i was sobbing i decided i had enough and put on my shoes to walk to my mothers house which he blocked me from leaving the house and forced me upstairs. I had agreed to do things with him until the new years of which i cut contact with him after it including my grandmother and grandfather which witnessed his actions over the years and to my knowledge didnt say to him about it. 

He has now apologised alot over text and my gran came to my mother crying at her clinic of which i work at but wasnt in that day. I dont know if i should reach out to them but whenever im with them my anxiety and deppression gets quite bad even with the help of medication i went to lunch with him in febuary and he said he will change (hes said this a million times before) and that i should go out and do stuff with them again.

c689u3	2019-06-27 17:21:10	Largetetas	AITA for posting about our wedding before my groom told his dad?	"
My husband and I got engaged in the begining of this year. Hes in the military so for BT he was only communicating with me through mail for 3 months, and in one letter he proposed. He picked a date for me to go visit him at his training school and get hitched. I told my immediate family to keep it on the down low for superstitious reasons (we are a Hispanic family mal de ojo is legit people lmfao) anyway, him and his mom dont have the best of relationships but she bonded with me during his BT and I told him he should tell his mom about the court ""wedding"" to see if she could go (she couldnt) and she follow up with telling him ""not to post anything or tell anyone about the wedding"". Okay that's fine! We werent planning on it.


So fast forward to about a week after the wedding I still havent posted any of the cute pictures I have of the wedding because once I brought it up to him he told me he hadnt even told his DAD (whom hes much more close to than his mom) or his best friend (whom he wants to be his best man for our actual big wedding.) 
I told him ""why? I told my best friend and my immediate family, why cant you? Nothing bad happened. We are already married what could go wrong?"" 


And he just said that his mom mentioned ""something bad would happen if he did post or tell anyone"" he has since spoken with all his friends and dad multiple times. We never brought the topic up after that situation. 
It is now months later and I didn’t think there would be any issues with me posting it this far down the line. It turns out he never told any of them and he’s mad because I took his chance away of being able to tell them on his own terms that he got married. When he had all the chances in the world and at the end of the day I'm sure nothing bad would have happened if he told his DAD. 


I just didnt get why he is so gung ho about not mentioning it to his best friend and dad just because his mom said ""something bad would happen"" if he did. She got to flaunt her marriage idk why shes trying to control ours and hes just going with it, and now his mom is complaining to him about me posting the pictures. AITA for posting it? Or is he just low key ashamed.

UPDATE: the dad ended up finding out and though he said It sucked to find out through a post  he didnt understand why my husband didnt tell him about it. He expressed always having my husbands back and is very happy for us. So mo harm done. Universe is still intact! Lol my husband and I have known each other for years since middle school and are in our mid twenties, and though it might have seemed rushed we had been living together before him being shipped out to BT. We didnt want to fall into that stereotype but the military really made it hard to even see each other if we werent married."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c689cq	2019-06-27 17:19:58	dramatic_coffee_boi	AITA for telling my boss his business is f***ed	"Hey AITA, long time lurker finally needing some judgement in my life too :D

So basically I work in a bar/cafe that does a lot of coffee (in fact coffe is the main thing we even sell lol), one of those real fancy machines that you grind the beans manually then run it through the machine and steam-froth the milk yourself. Fancy smansy stuff, basically.

Well this place isn't really turning profit (definitely not significant profit), hasn't done for a while which is pretty obvious (on a good weekday we'll probs take about $40 -  $50 max, sometimes as little as $15 for a whole day). 

Well, when we froth our milk for a customer there's usually a bit of milk/froth left in the bottom of the little jug (maybe a shot glass worth at most) which I tend to just pour down the sink since customers are few and far between so there's not much point, in my mind, in saving a tiny bit of froth for like half an hour (at which point it'll be gorss to add more fresh milk imo).

My boss (owner, stressed out guy, can't blame him tbf) disagrees, he saw me pour this tiny bit of milk and told me ""don't throw that away, it's wasting my stock and wasting profits"", to which I replied ""if milk is eating all our profits then the business is already f\*\*\*ed tbh, bud"".

Oh man did I push a button, he got pretty mad and told me to ""do as you're f\*\*\*ing told and don't get smart with me"". I miantained that it's just a tiny bit of milk which is cheap af, but backed down since he was pretty pasisonate about the milk issue and I don't want to tick him off too much.

c689cb	2019-06-27 17:19:56		WIBTA if I didn't let my mom use my room as a guest room while I'm at University?	"TLDR: My mom now wants the key to my room to use it as a guest bedroom. I won't be taking all my things and have some expensive stuff in my room and don't want people I don't know in it. I also will come back home during winter and spring break. I may be coming back during the summer.


My mom recently asked me to give her the key to my room when I leave for university. At first I was like heck no but I've been thinking about it and now don't know if I would be an asshole not to give it. In the past during around middle school and elementary school, my mom would have guests from our home country that just came to the US. They would stay in my room and I would need to sleep on a spare bed in my sisters room. Most of the time it was guests I've never met before. Since I started high school my mom hasn't had any guests and I assume because it would be weird if I slept in the same room as my sister. Currently in my room I have a $1000+ PC I built, a $300+ monitor, and a Xbox one x that cost $500 when I bought it. I probably won't be bring them to University and will just bring a laptop. I probably wouldn't mind an adult but I'm really afraid if my cousins come over and break something. My mom does have cousins come over often and my mom is very oblivious and forgetful. She will probably forget to lock my door and my little cousins may break my stuff. Things like this have happened in the past when I was younger where cousins have broken my Nintendo DS. On my Wii they messed up all the save files. I'll also have a lot of my clothes and other belongings in my room still. I will be back home during winter and spring break but possibly not during the summer. If I get an internship in New York where I'm going to uni then I might stay in New York for the summer."		1	0

"My girlfriend and I have known each other for three years and been together for two of those. By luck of the draw, my birthday falls on New Year’s eve. Nice in theory, right? Well, in actuality, it kind of sucks because everyone’s too focused on the holiday.

The issue is that my girlfriend considers NYE to be a “family” holiday and thus, refuses to miss out on New Year’s eve with her family. This would obviously be fine, if it was not my birthday. I feel somewhat neglected by this and feel like what should be my special day does not matter to her. I wouldn’t mind spending NYE/my birthday with her family, but I would also love to actually go out and celebrate New Years and my birthday properly with her. 

This has caused friction between us in the past. Although we’re only in our early 20s now, I can’t imagine being in my 30s or 40s and spending my birthday each year without my would-be wife.

c688fy	2019-06-27 17:17:46		AITA For Wanting the Freedom to Get Tattooed. My Fiance Doesn't Find Them Attractive.	"Me (29M) and my new fiance (25F) have been together for 7 years, and are planning to get married in a year.

&#x200B;

We've always been a very strong couple, but we got an issue regarding whether or not I should have the freedom to get a tattoo. Which she doesn’t find attractive. 

 

We've grown up differently, my parents have always been strict, but also very supportive of creativity and freedom. On the subject of tattoos, my father had a rule ""No piercings or tattoos while living under my roof."" I've always been cool with that, I basically left home for college and career at 18 and still never got one. Instead, I waited for the right idea to come, spent years trying to find the right artist, and do the tattoo ""right"". I've always made this known to everybody, and never kept it a secret. This was 3-4 years ago.

&#x200B;

During this, my fiance (GF at the time) had MAJOR issues with this. She doesn’t find the attractive.  

&#x200B;

Throughout that entire process, I tried my DAMNDEST to explain to her the ""self-importance"" of doing this for myself alone.

&#x200B;

She didn't see it this way... I told her I cared about her opinions and views, but in the end this is something of importance to me. I can sympathize… but I also hold my values.

&#x200B;

Anyways through all of that buildup, I got that original tattoo years ago. She couldn't look at it for a while. But we worked through it, and she still finds me attractive. I know she doesn't love the tattoo on my shoulder, but she isn't disgusted by me. 

&#x200B;

So between then and now, I had mentioned to her i'd like to get another. To which she would roll her eyes and give me a lighthearted ""ugh, where this time."" I kept transparency with her on placement, design idea, and have never been secretive. I found a new artist, and want to get another piece on the inside of my bicep, nothing vulgar or trashy. I asked her if she'd want to accompany me this time, and worked to book the appointment on a schedule where it worked for both of us.

&#x200B;

But now I'm a week out and this is starting to blow up again. And back to the root of the problem on her end ""I don't respect her opinion or I wouldn't do it."" We've had extremely long conversations where I’ve gotten emotional and sad and explaining the importance of being able to have certain life freedoms, I think all people should have. I want more than anything for her to understand where I'm coming from and to trust in me.

&#x200B;

She's mentioned we're about to get married, and it's not just about me anymore, we're a unit. 

&#x200B;

She says ""don't say you care, because between a tattoo and my feelings, you pick the tattoo"" and I feel like that’s not fair and missing the point of this whole thing.

&#x200B;

I don't know how I can mend or help this scenario, without compromising my deeper-rooted belief that I should be allowed to have freedom for personal self-expression."	Not the A-hole	1	0

It's the last inning of the game. I'm sitting at third base just dicking around with the pitcher/catcher, dancing while walking back to third, running halfway and starting pays that go nowhere, that sorta thing. 

Third base coach looks at me and says, you don't need to do anything, we're gonna lose anyway. I already know that, that's why I'm screwing around. I took it fine, since i don't ever feel too much pressure, and i don't beat myself up over plays. But the coach said it a little too loud, and this mom/dad starts yelling at him about it. After inevitably losing the game, they're still arguing about it. Then the mom came over to me and started talking.

 ""See, he's wrong because it made you feel bad.""

 ""Uh, no lady, it's just good fun. I was not getting upset at that at all, ok? ""

""No, it's not good fun. The coach shouldn't be saying that.""

 ""C'mon, none of here are upset about it. You need to calm down. ""

Right about then, my parents forced me to stop, and the coach started giving his end-of-game speech. I was then forced to apologize to her (parents) even though I felt no shame from it. My parents explained her view of it, parents pay $100 fpr the season and feel that the coach shouldn't be negative about it, especially when he could be teaching us. My view is that the lady was trying to use me to further her view. It pissed me off because she told me how I felt, and i wasn't feeling bad.

I had been there three four before and my favourite ride was (and still is) The Hollywood Tower Of Terror. It was a ""scary"" ride based of of the Twilight Zone, which is a very old TV series. In the ride you sit in a large elevator which pulls you down faster than gravity which makes you get lifted off your seat (we're strapped in).

Well, when  we arrived my parents promised me that i could get one piece of merch at the end of the trip, as we were staying there for three days and i wanted a T-shirt from the Tower of Terror. On the last day we went to the ride, also the park was about to close in 15 minutes which would give my dad and I just enough time to go on the ride and get a shirt on the way out. So ten minutes later we are next in line to go on the ride but then I see a maybe 16 yo girl exit through the emergency exit doors because she was scared and that set off the alarm meaning that we ALL had to leave by the EMERGENCY DOORS. When my dad and I were outside, my mum decided to go into the shop to get the shirt that I wanted, but THEY HAD JUST CLOSED! So my mum couldn't get in, meaning i couldn't get the shirt that my parents had promised me three days ago which made me start crying A LOT. Now, I'm not spoiled but I have ADHD which can make my emotions go ALL OVER THE PLACE. So my mum and dad tried to get me the shirt and were telling that to the shop employee. I can't remember what They said but i figure it went something like this:

Mum: Can I please just go inside and buy this shirt.  
Shop employee: Sorry, ma'am but we can't let you go inside. There has been an emergency and-  
Dad: The ""emergency"" was a wimpy girl!  
SE: Sorry sir, but no matter the emergency we can't let you in.  
M: Do you see my son? \*points at me\* We have promised him this shirt for three days.  
SE: I understand your problem but we can't let you in.  
D: If you don't let us give you money for this T-shirt, this will be the last thing that he remembers of Disney Land.

After about 5 minutes he let my mum buy me the shirt and I loved it. But now I think of think of this from the SE's perspective and i wonder, were my parents being entitled?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

That, is 100% understandable. Everyone should explore their sexualities when growing up, and i want them to know what's good and what's bad.

What i would be furious with, is if my daughter ever got a boyfriend until she's at least 16. 

I have a friend, and he has a little sister who's 14. She invites over a new boy from school once every 1-2 weeks, has a lock on her door, and the parents don't care what's going on. Even tho you can hear moaning and stuff, they don't censor their voice and it's extremely disturbing. She even openly said that she's refilling her entire bottle of birth control pills that contain 70, and got empty in a month.. wtf..

I'm thoroughly disgusted as i would not want my little angel plowed by an army of boys going 100% all out on her, while i am still a virigin at 21. I feel like I'd fail her as a father by not having these standards.

To back up my opinion, she now thinks shes an adult just because shes in highschool, and does things on her own decisions, and they are not good decisions at all. At this point she isn't listening to her parents/friends and wants to 'move away'.

As a downside, MIL's youngest adult son is a severe drug addict and still lives with her in the same house, leeches off of her financially and expects her to pay all of his bills and eats a ridiculous amount of food due to the drugs he takes. He buys none of this food. For the last week, I've been buying all the groceries, and large amounts of it disappear in the same day because of him. Including drinks, multiple packages of bread and meat, etc. He doesn't contribute to anything in the house, and makes a mess all the time expecting MIL to clean it up, but he will spend hundreds on designer clothes and drugs. MIL is in denial about the drug use, even though he's openly talked about it with us and his friends, and has been brought in by the police multiple times. He's very agressive, ignores his family most of the time, and just generally isn't himself. 
 She also still uses the ""he's young/ still a teen"" excuse even though he's 23 by now. 

Girlfriend has been sick for the last couple of days so I went to the healthfood store and spent a lot of money on some probiotic drinks to boost her immune system. Girlfriend had two drinks the day I bought them and the next morning all of them were gone because my brother in law drank the entire package. I even found empty bottles in his room. 

 Today, I went grocery shopping and labelled only the case of probiotics as ""for girlfriend. Do not touch"". Mother in law proceeded to freak out at me, saying I hurt her by doing that because brother in law lives here too and he's entitled to have whatever he wants in this house. I calmly explained that girlfriend is sick and brother in law would drink the whole case if I didn't label it. I also mentioned that even I am not going to drink from the case. She denied everything about brother in law eating my food and insists that he definitely buys his own food and doesn't steal from me. She continued to get annoyed that I could be so selfish and said she would do the same with everything in her house. I tried to get her to understand and she said she never would and asked me to leave. 

I'm feeling really bad about this because me and MIL have never really gotten into an argument before and I am staying in her home. We've also been pretty close until this point so I thought I'd ask you guys, am I the asshole?"		1	0
c6843g	2019-06-27 17:08:00		WIBTA If I ignored a former friends existence?	"I am no longer on good terms with a friend. We'll call them Sara.

In the beginning I tried to fix whatever issues we had and in return I was met with major gas lighting and some narcissism. After our last exchange I was met with radio silence for about a month and thought to myself, ""I shouldn't even be entertaining this."" and I just blocked her on everything so she has no way of contacting me. We still have mutual friends, they understand how she is, how she acts but choose not to take sides. I said no problem, I don't bring her up, speak her name, or speak bad of her. They still do (bring her up) and bring up good times which doesn't bother me at all, I just let it go in one ear and out the other. 

She just doesn't exist for me anymore. 

We all worked together, but she was not able to join us on this new assignment due to pregnancy in the beginning of assignment. 

We head back home next month and I still plan to continue as if Sara doesn't exist. Mutual friends have been bringing her up more lately, how's she's doing, her baby, and other things. People have been pitching in for baby things. I give no reaction other than, ""Oh okay,"" ""That's nice of you."" ""Glad her pregnancy is going well.""

I had honestly thought for a moment maybe it would be nice for me to make a baby blanket as just a show of good will. I might not like her but I don't wish evil on her. In the end I decided against it.

They plan on doing a card for the birth and having everyone sign. I'm leaning towards not even being a part of that. 

Friends want to do celebrations and have her there. I'm planning on just saying no thank you. 

I literally want nothing to do with her. Sara's mouth is rude and mean and I'd rather not have to snap at a woman who is pregnant or just gave birth. I will not tolerate being treated that way anymore so I will. Without a second thought, and NOT be nice about it. 

The only thing I would do is just be professional/polite at work. If it's not work related, it's a hard nope for me. Not even a ""Hi"" or ""Bye"".

Mutual friends tell me not to be an ass about it, especially with celebrations because it's not about me and such yadda yadda, just be happy for people yadda but I honestly don't think I'm as bad as I can be with this. WIBTA?"	No A-holes here	1	0

c683ax	2019-06-27 17:06:09		AITA for arguing over a school group chat ?	"To set out the context, I moved to Switzerland when I was just a Kid (Less than 2), so I grew up in the same city (Guess where) for about 80% of all my life. During all these years, I went to the same international school (There aren't much) and followed the campus changes that occured, so I believed to be part of ""Family Spirit"" they announce. Lived awesome moments with awesome teachers and friends and also some more shitty moments.

So in secondary school, in MYP2 or 3 (12-13 yrs old), everybody started getting their own mobile phones and thus, a year group chat was created. People went on and off, but there was only 1 ""mod"" to avoid all the trolling. She was the ""I'm a cool kid"" girl, only talk to my friends and don't give a f about others. So when I moved back to France in Summer 2017, this year group was one of the last ways of communication with my old school. I was able to keep up with all the scandals and affairs that happened until today.

So I wake up this morning, revise for exams, browse reddit and do usual stuff until I see on the group [this message](https://imgur.com/a/3bJYoZ5). ""Hello guys so i've heard multiple people want all the people in the group who are not in the school anymore to be removed so ye. Plus we are going to organise our gradtrip so it just makes sense if only the people going are on the chat ! Sorry"". And she then proceeds to kick out about 20 people from the group. Like WTF. I've been in the school for longer than you. But since most of the girls there were just pure B's, especially one of her closest friends, a spanish ""I'm a popular kid"", which I suspects for being behind all this. 

So I hit her DM's asking :

1. WTF did she do that ?
2. Why kick us out as we are still part of the school ?
3. Why just not make a separate group for the grad trip ?

And a sum up of her different answers is : 

* Why do you care, you are not part of the school anymore.

&#x200B;

I'd like to tell her to go fuck herself, but I don't think it would be ideal for reintegration. In addition that the group isn't official or endorsed by the school so complaining to teachers wouldn't lead to nothing either.

Still venting about it now.

So AITA for arguing about a group chat and believing kicking more than 20 people just because ""They aren't active students anymore"" is a dick move ?"		1	0

Long story short, she never left lol. I have a pretty big 1 bedroom apartment. I have the bedroom, and she’s been sleeping on my couch, and keeping her stuff in the adjoining dining room. She brought basically nothing when she moved in, no towels, pots/pans, dishes, or furniture. Rent for my 1 bedroom is $1410 plus utilities. I’ve been charging her $550, but this month I told her I’d really appreciate if she starts paying $650. She really doesn’t want to because she doesn’t feel like she’s getting anything more in the situation. But I don’t feel like she should be paying $300 less than me, when we’re basically just splitting the apartment. I’d also like to add that we carpool to work (and basically everywhere) because she doesn’t have a car anymore, and she never helps with gas. AITA?? Or is raising her rent fair?

**edit** For the YTA voters saying we’re not really splitting the apartment. We’re splitting the common areas, and she has had the choice of using the “dining room” as a bedroom. But she’s chosen to keep using the couch, and not buy a bed and dresser. Once she realized this was going to be longer term, her plan was to buy a divider so it felt like a studio set up, but she just hasn’t done any of that. By her own choice. Plus I go out of my way to not hang out in the living/dining room anymore than I have to. Not even having friends over anymore. So in that way, I feel like we are basically splitting the apartment."

Last night I got off work extra late and need to grab some minor groceries and stuff so I went to the seedy Walmart by my house get my stuff pay and start heading to the parking lot.  

As I’m waiting for the cars to pass so I don’t get hit a younger woman ( early 20’s) came out of the Walmart and waited next to me to cross.  We both cross at the same time and end up waking down the same parking lane. No biggie right? Well she picked up her pace and kept looking back at me which I found odd but paid it no mind.  

She turned into the gap between my car and the one parked by my drivers door so I assumed it was her car I pulled up to grab my little box I like to keep my eggs in out of my back seat and she was standing there with pepper spray pointed at me.  I guess she thought I was following her but when I explained that this was my car and I was just trying to put my groceries away she said I should have walked on the other side of the parking lot to make her feel safe since it was at night and I “ look like a bad guy” granted I’m a  bigger person in life but I’m also pretty tall so this isn’t the first time I have accidentally scared someone.  She then said I was a creep for following her went around her car and got in backed out very fast and gave me the finger.

I am a female who is really interested in herpetology (reptiles and amphibians) and have had an issue finding people in my area who share the same interest.  Going out looking for things usually results in being alone in really out there places, a lot of the time at night, without service, which I don’t prefer doing.  I recently reconnected with a guy I went to high school with who is also into herpetology. I was super excited to have someone interested and willing to go out with.  He is also extremely knowledgeable on the subject matter and I am learning so much every time.   He also is really connected within the community. I am really passionate about herpetology and am probably going to pursue my masters in a field related. I spend most of my time reading about it as well.

My boyfriend and I recently became long distance because of a job offer he had to take.  He is not happy with me spending my time alone with this guy.  I have offered to introduce him to my reconnected friend so he feels more comfortable and less threatened but he says he doesn’t want to meet him.  He doesn’t like me spending night time hours in these random places with him.  I don’t really want to go back to having to be in these sketchy places alone at night. I should also emphasize I’ve tried to find female friends that are interested but haven’t had much luck or people don’t really understand how long the hours can be when looking for things and lose interest.  I am a believer that guys and girls can just be friends but my mom called me naive in thinking that and kind of sided with my boyfriend in being upset.

The problem is, she has been telling me lies and disgusting things about my sister. Recently she told me she told them to my mother, because, as a mother herself she would want to know the thruth about her own daughter (6F). 
During final season, she brought her daughter to the house almost every single day and just made small talk with my mother while the daughter runs around, screams, jumps on the beds, throws things around, not once she told her to stop. It got so bad my sister had to go study to my grandmas house.
It feels like she has a secret hate towards my sister. Yet, somehow she wants me and her to spend the holidays? She even said she would leave her car for us to drive around.
Now, she accepted a job far away, and only comes the weekends, the daughter is with the father and grandmother but due to their work she ends up in the neighbors house a lot. But now she wants to take her.
And this is where it all makes sense, she wants me and my sister to take care of her demon child while she works.
She is living in a 2 bedroom house, with her new boyfriend, 1 bedroom for her and her boyfriend, the other she is furnishing for her daughter... So where would we sleep? The couch, maybe the floor?

c680i7	2019-06-27 17:00:09		WIBTA if I called CPS on my parents or ran away from home to the police station?	"They don't want me to take to Reddit. They want me to talk to family members or a licensed psychologist. And they believe going to Reddit is ""immature"" and ""a violation of my parents' privacy"".

They always laugh and scoff at me if I ever threaten to call CPS or run away. But at this point I'm about ready to do so anyway.

-----

I am 17M and my parents are 56F and 59M. I've recently been complaining about their helicopter parenting, but they believe that I'm not at the maturity level I need to be, and feel the need to police everything I do in life and online. They take everything I've done wrong, instead of done right, and use it against me and to try to justify that.

I was diagnosed with autism, and apparently I'm at a lower maturity level than I need to be, so they shelter and police me. And being that I can't argue, they believe that what they do is justified since I can't make a good argument against why they shouldn't.

When I was 12 I got caught looking at porn and as such they set up parental controls. I have a history of repeat violation of this so for the past few years they've kept my (yes, mine) computer in the living room. I've recently been complaining about it but they tell me that I need to have a ""higher maturity level"" before they let me.

They say I argue for the sake of arguing, and that it's very circular (I don't see how) and they always have to shut me down. Again, I've never been taught how to argue effectively, and even if I say something, they always have something to say back.

They take phone at 9pm because I'm ""on my phone all day, don't need it at night, and I need to get good sleep"", even though I good sleep already. 

They do it because ""the city police and school district said so, even your psychiatrist, and it's my job as a parent to know what my kids do"" and I don't know what to say back.

They're like,  ""If you can sleep, then why do you NEED it?"" And I didn't have an argument against this, because I can't argue. They always shut me down by saying, ""My house, my rules"". And if I challenge them, they threaten to take away my internet access.

They don't even take my sentiments and resentments into account, nor the fact that I legally can't move out! I've tried getting a job but they have not called back yet, and they won't even let me drive a car until I'm 18! 

They don't want me getting a brain tumor, but they don't realize that the radiation phones emit is harmless.

They want to monitor what I do on my phone and computer to prevent me from looking at porn, see what I chat about, and control my stream of information. I live in a Christian household. And I'm against alternative medicine, and they believe I'm searching misinformation (I look at Wikipedia and meta-analyses). I'm allowed to have my own beliefs.

It was quite crowded, and no tables were open. There was one four-person table, with a bag on the inner seat, and a newspaper on the table. I moved the newspaper to be next to the bag, and sat down with my friend. Midway through our meal, a large man, probably around 5’10 or so came over, and I stood up to let him into the seat, but he began yelling at me. “How could you move my things? That is so rude! You saw my stuff!” I gestured to allow him through, but he shouted, “It’s fine, I’ll just sit somewhere else!” At this point, the table next to us had opened up. Since he clearly didn’t want to go anywhere near the inner part of the table, I sat down. This made him more angry and he asked, “Well, can you at least hand me my bag?!” I handed him his bag, and he went to the other table, continuing to mutter things about how I was so rude and that I had seen his bag. My friend and I exchanged a look but didn’t say anything, and we continued to eat our food. About five minutes later, he turns around, stares directly at me, and says, “The word you’re looking for is ‘I’m sorry.’” I didn’t respond. 

For context, I am a 5’1 petite woman, and while I understand that some people see all people as equal, the physical disparity and anger made me feel really uncomfortable and unsafe. Additionally, he never acknowledged, looked at, or yelled at my friend, who is a 5’8 male.

c67xqd	2019-06-27 16:54:08	Rivsmama	AITA for telling my 5 year old that he will never die and neither will I?	"I have a 5 year old son. He's very sweet and sensitive and smart and just a really adorable, awesome little guy. He has adhd and some behavioral issues, and I'm afraid he has also inherited my anxiety. 

 The first time someone told him and explained to him in detail about death was when he was at a playdate with one of his friends. Her uncle had recently passed away from an OD and it was a really sad, shitty situation. She was struggling with what happened and very upset. Her mom, who is a close friend of mine, explained that he was dead and some other details about death, in general. She decided to tell my son about it, and that he would die too and get buried in the dirt. It terrified him. 

He would randomly starts crying and saying he doesn't want to die, he couldn't sleep, he was attached to me constantly, and he was afraid of everything. It was awful. 

I finally got him to where he was ok, still afraid and would occasionally get upset about it, but pretty much ok. I reassured him that he was a little boy and he has a mommy and daddy who will never let anything happen to him. I avoided telling him that he will not die, ever, because I didn't want to flat out lie to him. I just sort of worked around it.

 Then, a few days ago, a little girl in his afterschool program who was a few years older than him, told him that he *will* die because everyone dies when they turn 100 and that I will die too and he will never see me again. When I picked him up, he was crying. He was so terrified. He doesn't really understand numbers, so 100 years old doesn't really mean a lot to him. For all he knows, that could be next week or tomorrow. 

I initially tried the same approach as before, but when he asked me if he can still see people after they die, I admitted that he couldn't. 

 He got scared again and started panicking and crying. I finally told him ""bud. You are not going to die. Ever. Not when you're 100, not ever. And neither will I. Your friend from school is just a kid and she doesn't know what she's talking about. ""

 I told my friend about it later because I felt kind of shitty for lying to him, and she said I shouldn't have done that because he will find out eventually and it was fucked up for me to do that.

 I just feel like he's too young. He can't handle it. He doesn't have the capacity to really understand, and all it does is scare him. I don't want him being afraid of everything and sad all the time. I tried to explain it more realistically and it didn't work. Idk what else to do. 

TL;DR Told my 5 year old he will never die and neither will I, because he's terrified of death. Might be an asshole for lying to my son about something so important

Edit: Thanks I realize in this situation, I'm an asshole. I shouldn't have lied. I should have known I was wrong because of how guilty it made me feel. That's usually a good indicator that you've done something you shouldn't have. I'm going to pull his therapist aside at our next appointment and ask her for some advice on how to better handle this."

My entire family is against tattoos, mostly my dad's side because they were mostly raised catholic and every time I bring it up to my grandma, she says it's 'against God' or something like that.

I feel like it would be a way of honoring her, I wouldn't be who I am without her, and even without that day.

I don't want it on display or anything, I'm thinking about having the tattoo over my heart that way it's out of sight in public.

I also think my dad doesn't like the idea of it because he likes to shit talk about my mother. They did not have a good relationship near the end of her life.

My main concern about being the asshole is that my family doesn't want me to do it. I think that they will take it as a 'fuck you' to them, and I don't want that happening. I just want some other people's opinions on it.

I haven't asked anyone on my mother's side about this because they all live far away, and her parents have also passed."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We typically need about 4 employees on the floor on a given day and we only have two full time people (me being one) and 3 part timers. We recently fired an employee after 7 YEARS of her not doing her job when she was here and calling off at LEAST once a week. I'm pretty sure this employee has job security so that's not an issue. They rarely fire people here.

So this employee hasn't always been reliable. She is always going out on work nights coming in hungover or calling off (I'd say at least once a month). Well the past couple weeks she's been complaining of back pain, which I understand totally sucks, but she's been calling off due to said pain (about 5 times in the past 2 weeks). Now, normally I'd totally get it, as I've thrown my back out before and it totally sucks, but she will go out and make posts on snap chat and Facebook showing her going off and doing things where she's clearly walking around just fine. She also waits until less than an hour before her shift or when she's supposed to already be in the building to say she can't come in, which makes it super difficult to cover her shift on such short notice and screws the rest of us  The last time she called off she went to a wedding and then called off the next morning. Later on that day she posted about her out and enjoying the weather with pictures of her where she was clearly not in pain. After having to work short handed for so long (which makes the day super rough) and getting incredibly annoyed about it I took a screenshot of the pic and sent it to my manager. He's been aware that she goes out a LOT and he was the one who had to cover her shift and miss a family engagement because of it, so I thought he deserved to know. Today she storms into the lunchroom saying ""hey snitch"" and going off about how I'm childish for telling him. She claims that she sees the chiropractor before going out and doing these things so she feels fine and her back pain only occurs in the morning. I asked her if resting instead of going out may help, and she stated that has nothing to do with it and she just needs physical therapy (which she's not getting). She also said she would never do that to me, which I replied she wouldn't need to because I show up to my shifts and don't go out and party on the days I call off. 

Edit: She has been spoken with about the behavior from our manager and a few other employees and she just doesn't care. She's also the employee that begs for more hours but requests a LOT of days off because she ""wants to enjoy the summer"".

c67w25	2019-06-27 16:50:21	Xtracripy25	AITA bc I am always a dick to my dad?	"For context, I’m 35 and my parents are in their mid 60s. My parent were divorced when I was 2 years old. My dad always lived in another state and would visit my older brother (18m older) and biweekly/monthly. 

I have resentment for my dad and don’t respect him as a person. I find it unbearable to be around him and his fiancé (not actually getting married). They visit monthly now, mostly to see my children and “hangout.” Let me give you some facts about why I feel I have resentment: 

1. When my mom and he were married, he treated her like shit. Being hard on her about her weight, being selfish, thinking the world was his oyster. For example, while my brother and I were 1 & 2, he went to Hong Kong for business for two weeks. Called my mom on the way back and said he needed some rest and relaxation and that he was going to Hawaii for 3 days on his way back home. Inconsiderate prick. 

2. He is very concerned with having money, although he has pissed everything he ever made away and has nothing to show for it. He always thought the world owed him something and was hard to work with. Every business job ended badly, all the prospects he told us about never panned out, and he is now “retired” basically living off his rich GF. He saved nothing, has no retirement, and travels to Europe, LA, UK on her dime. He sends pictures showing the great time he’s having. 

3. He thinks women should take care of him financially. He has literally said, “what? Girls get taken care of by men all the time.” His second wife was a millionaire trust fund baby. He helped to raise her two kids for 10 years, then she kicked him to the curb when things never improved for him financially. Even in financial ruin, he continued to try and uphold this ritzy lifestyle until he could find his next sugar momma. He has now been with a women for 10 years, who’s family owns a multimillion dollar company. He lives in her and her ex-husbands family house where her and ex raised their kids. It’s a $1m house with pool, lawn service. My dad pays for nothing and shuffled around the house in slippers. OH and he (well she) bought him a grave plot next to hers in her family cemetery 400 miles away from his families cemetery for when they die. 

4. He’s oblivious to how pathetic he is. He wanted to lock down current GF so he proposed to her as a promise to her. He bought her a ring... with her money. Now she wears it everywhere and they refers to each other as fiancé. They are not planning on getting married as much as my dad wants to (bc he will get her $).

Overall, AITA? We have no deep relationship, only surface level interactions. I have a nice home, great job with pension, a beach house for my family to enjoy and I have had a lot of success working with people and making this happen for myself. I can’t stand that he is so pathetic and I resent that he has an entire life of no self reflection/change, trying to mooch off others, and he’s totally fine with it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

People 
Nob & Sob - friends
Mark & Sally - couple
Evelyn - friend
Shaun - side player
Bob - very good friend

Sorry a bit of history. 
I started working at a place, one that serves beverages. About a month or so later Evelyn started coming there. I was smitten at the time I thought she was amazing. We tried to date but it was never going to work out 

She was a more nicer person than me and made sure we became friend. I though my work introduced them to Nob and Sob, Bob & Mark & Sally. We seemed like a great bunch of friends. We have been on holidays together and I thought everything was going great. I left the place I worked for a better job

As single guys, Me, Nob, Sob, Bob & Shaun used to go out a lot have a good time and generally had fun. Shaun got married, then moved 100 miles away. Bob met a wonderful lady and moved 50 miles away. They still stayed in touch so all seemed well. Me and Nob would go to cinema, meet up during the day. Meet Sob as he would only drink at the place I used to work.

2 years ago I moved about 5 miles away. It would take me 30 minutes to travel back to town on public transport.  At first I didn’t think anything was different but I noticed my messages were either ignored totally or replied too a couple of days later. Over time I noticed that the only ones who would invite me out to catch up was Bob and Shaun.

So I decided that I would stop messaging and see what would happen next. Nothing. I realised 2 weeks ago that the only time I have seen or spoken to my “friends” in the last year and a half is because of either Bob and Shaun. However I saw on FB they were doing things meeting up etc but not inviting me.

This eventually led me to become depressed. Reviewing the above I decided to block all but Bob and Shaun on social media and mobiles. I’ve been feeling incredibly lonely and seeing so called friends going out and having a great time hurts when there is no sign of an invitation.

Since I made this decision. Bob and Shaun have been contacting me saying the rest 
are upset with me for blocking them, I should apologise and make amends for making them feel rejected. I sat down with Bob yesterday and told him how I felt he didn’t notice what had been going on and agreed that everyone should make more of an effort but I should give them another chance. Shaun still insists I’m TA

So eventually the question. AITA for blocking who I feel are not friends?"	Asshole	0	0

"I know this sounds dumb but I'm literally at my wits end with my relationship. I've been with my boyfriend for two years now and I knew getting into the relationship he had children with someone who has been labelled as a narcissist sociopath. 

She's one of those mothers who says ""you don't take care of your own kids!"" and then never allows the kids to see their father. He begs and pleads to be able to see his own children and she refuses. If she actually let's them come and see them, I'd like to describe these kids as clearly brainwashed. They distance themselves away and are on their phones the whole time, looking annoyed. And then their mother will retaliate ""see, they hate you! They don't even WANT to see you!"" 

I don't want to sound rude but his children are obese due to the fact that she doesn't make them do anything. My boyfriends son didn't even know how to properly sweep, and proceeded to cry when shown the correct way. These kids lock themselves in their rooms all day, eat whatever they want (she doesn't cook and only feeds them fast food), and do not exercise. She is not teaching them healthy behaviors and these kids have beautiful personalities when given the right environment to let them grow and shine. 

I love his kids, and I want to see them as much as he does. I'm a big piece of shit according to his ex, but I don't care what she thinks of me. My main huge problem is my boyfriend complete unwillingness to do anything about this situation. Him and his ex wife argue constantly. She harasses him consistently. He will not go and attempt to get any custody of his kids because he thinks he will lose. I highly doubt that. He's a great father and she has a history of severe mental issues. 

I think he needs to get custody of his kids and block his ex wife so they can no longer argue and fight constantly. I am about to break up with him as sad as it is. I do love him but seeing him pissed off constantly and hearing him fight with ex wife every other day is exhausting. I want a partner who is with me in the present and not stuck in the past. 

So WIBTA if I throw this ultimatum at him? I know he has every right to talk to anyone he wants to but its negatively affecting his life, and his children's."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c67qz2	2019-06-27 16:38:57	jormungandratemdingo	AITA for not wanting to be around the recovery community/friends from rehab?	"TL;DR at the bottom.

I am gender queer/non-binary and bisexual, my husband and I moved from a fairly liberal area of the country across it back to our conservative home towns for familial support a year ago when I decided to get sober. I'm female, mid-late 20's. When I come out with my pronouns **I always let people know that it is OK if they mess up - the fact that they are trying is what is important and that I greatly appreciate their effort, and they themselves.**

For the past year, I have had a lot of trouble and inner turmoil about the disconnect from the recovery community (including the healthcare workers) about respecting my pronouns and my identity itself when I come out to them. I went to an ""all women"" 3/mo rehab center last fall-winter and it helped me greatly. Not incredibly LGBTQ+ friendly, but other than that it was very effective.

I'm 4 months out of the facility and have since completely stopped going to NA meetings and do not go to the special ""women's only"" meetings held at the center I went to. A few weeks ago someone from NA messaged me asking if I was doing OK. I explained why I have ex-communicated myself from the community and they said that they are the most accepting group ever, etc. They aren't. I've tried. It doesn't work. I even explained it was because of my gender-identity and they continued to mis-gender me in the message, which is fine, it takes time, but I'm sick of it.

My family and my husband have also expressed concern about why I have stopped attending NA/AA meetings, when I explain to them why that is, they tell me that I'm over-reacting and that it will help me stay sober. I disagree, feeling alienated in a group that is supposed to be supportive and accepting of me ""no matter what"" is not going to keep me sober. **It hurts**. I don't think they understand the amount of **self-loathing I feel on an almost daily basis**. I feel like an inconvenience. I feel like I am ""making a big deal out of nothing"" even though it physically hurts when people belittle me about something that causes me so much pain. I'm not exaggerating even though I wish I was. I wish I cis-gendered. **I wish I was cis-gendered and I tried to be/act cis-gendered most of my life.**

AITA for not wanting to deal with this? 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** I'm gender queer/non-binary trying to get sober in a conservative area after moving from a fairly liberal one. Recovery community is not respectful or receptive to my preferred pronouns or my identity - after being in the closet and brushing it off for most of my life, I am in a place where I do not want to deal with this anymore. Family and husband think I am ""overreacting"" and that despite feeling alienated, will benefit from being submerged into a community where I feel ultimately unwelcome and belittled."		0	0
c67pg4	2019-06-27 16:35:14	hopefullynotme1	AITA for wanting to spay our pet cat?	"My partner and I have several cats, two females and a male. We have had three litters 'for fun' from one female (the other has been neutered) , once a year. The first was a still birth, second had 5 brilliant kittens, and the last had one survive (despite us staying up and attempting to support fading kittens every 2 hours for days).

Now we both work full time jobs, and there is a lot of stress associated with the kittens. thankfully, this is once a year, so not so bad. what really bothered me was the male cat would spray several times a day in the house, making it stink of cat urine, despite attempts to find and clean it (usually me, not my partner). This smell isnt just me being funny, it is commented on by each visitor to the house.

We are about to move, and I expect to spend a lot of money replacing carpets and deep cleaning the current house to 'fix' the problem. After suggesting we neuter the male to stop the problem, and therefore stop having kittens, my partner got very upset and mad, shouting and screaming, naturally, calling me the asshole. I have now 'ruined' the process and enjoyment of kittens apparently. While the spraying was half the problem, I want to see the cat as a pet and not have it live outdoors as an alternative to ruining the next house.

Am I the asshole and should I have respected my partners wishes and accepted the new house will stink?

&#x200B;

Update - Appreciate your honesty all-  Spaying/Neuter is not controlled in the UK, so not a legal thing. The cats are pedigree, the 5 kittens went for free to vetted owners who give a loving home (usually 800 dollars each here). I mistakenly said spay in the title when I mean neuter, sorry all.

      The problem is, she has been telling me lies and disgusting things about my sister. Recently she told me she told them to my mother, because, as a mother herself she would want to know the thruth about her own daughter (6F). 
      During final season, she brought her daughter to the house almost every single day and just made small talk with my mother while the daughter runs around, screams, jumps on the beds, throws things around, not once she told her to stop. It got so bad my sister had to go study to my grandmas house.
      It feels like she has a secret hate towards my sister. Yet, somehow she wants me and her to spend the holidays? She even said she would leave her car for us to drive around.
      Now, she accepted a job far away, and only comes the weekends, the daughter is with the father and grandmother but due to their work she ends up in the neighbors house a lot. But now she wants to take her.
      And this is where it all makes sense, she wants me and my sister to take care of her demon child while she works.
      She is living in a 2 bedroom house, with her new boyfriend, 1 bedroom for her and her boyfriend, the other she is furnishing for her daughter... So where would we sleep? The couch, maybe the floor?
      I can't stand it anymore, I don't want to take care of her demon child, I don't want to be cooking and caring for her, and sure as hell I can't stand another lie about my sister coming out her foul mouth.

"I (M23) have started a new job (about 2 months ago) that has me getting up around 4-4:30am to do fairly physical work. When I get home we have been remodeling the kitchen and so I get exhausted throughout the day. My Fiance (F24) has been saying that she wants to do more things together, because often when we have a break I will just sit in a chair to relax. It has also led her to asking about having sex more often, as my new sleep schedule doesn't fit hers (she gets up around 8). So often I work and then come home, work on the kitchen until I have to sleep, and I'm just too tired to try and do anything. I do stay up later some nights with her, but we don't often have sex unless it's the weekend and I can sleep in the next day.

Am I the asshole for wanting to sleep, over having sex?

EDIT: just wanted to clarify a few things: the kitchen is not ours, we live in (effectively) a duplex,  with my FMIL living in the other space (aka:her kitchen being remodeled). The remodeling was not my idea, I understand it needs to be done, but I wouldn't be working on it as much as we do if I had more of a choice (entire kitchen was taken to sub floors) and it has become a form of tension for the three of us. I love my fiance and am very attracted to her, just get tired after 14-16 hour work days."	No A-holes here	0	0
c67o7s	2019-06-27 16:32:24	throwaway2343133	AITA for calling in sick to work because of depression?	"I called in sick today because I could not mentally handle having to work. 

For context, I have been diagnosed with severe depression and am currently off of medication, although I'm trying to seek treatment (it's difficult to get in to see my doctor). 

I've been having a mental breakdown for the past few weeks, which has gotten progressively worse. I self harmed last night and genuinely wanted to end my life, although I ultimately didn't go through with it. 


I feel like an asshole, because the shift I was working was a closing shift, and my work has a hard time finding people to close. (I work at a fast food restaurant) I feel like having depression isn't a genuine excuse, and I feel like I'm that shitty employee that takes sick days for no reason. I didn't want to be that person who let their mental health consume their life and affect their job, but here I am. My coworkers always talk about going to work despite all the problems they have in life, and it makes me feel like I have to go in to work no matter how bad my mental health gets.

I try to keep my sick days to a minimum, and I even go in when I'm sick some days (mentally or physically). I've been forcing myself to go into work for the past few days, and people have been noticing that I'm not myself. Today, I can't handle it.

c67lx4	2019-06-27 16:27:12	notme1242	WIBTA if I collected money from a friend who threw up in the back of my GF's car?	"My girlfriend, Lucy, surprised me with Dead & Co concert tix recently. We brought Mark, whom we'd met once. Mark had posted on social media about how much he'd love to go - he's got Grateful Dead posters, show tickets, and vinyls covering his walls. We offered a ride.

He asked to stop at a tobacco shop on the way and bought a vape pen. I hate to quantify things such as how long we went out of our way because it seems to go against the spirit of the music, but I want to say it was an hour detour. Mark was friendly on the way down to Bristow; he filled a small pod for Lucy and shared his new vape with us.

Mark took five weaker tabs of acid at the show. He also shared one tab with me and offered drugs to all of us. Additionally, Mark brought a wax pen and smoked through the show.

I want to keep some emphasis away from the drugs taken, but I know it's not possible. We were at a Dead concert; Mark embraced what he thought the music meant more than needed. I don't want to blame the kid, the show was very pretty and Bob Weir hoarsely singing on I Know You Rider just sounds nice on acid.

Luckily Mark managed the way back to the car. My very kind and loving girlfriend was DD'ing. We bought some food and water and tried to take care of him. I don't want to say we were the most responsible people at that show. I should have been more realistic about how he was feeling & should have kept him away from more drugs.

On the very last leg of the drive home Mark threw 2-3 times on the floor of Lucy's sedan. He was instantly apologetic. I want to stress Mark really seemed sorry, and I've got many conflicting emotions about how to make things right.

We dropped him off and asked for a wax cartridge, Mark ran outside with one half-filled. To put arbitrary numbers on it, it would be ~$30.

Lucy and I went to a nearby gas station and cleaned out the car for one hour with sprays, paper towels, and air freshener. I washed the car mat. I don't know how clean it is now. Mark threw up around a liter of liquid.

We spent ~$15 on cleaning supplies and are considering taking the car to a wash, not sure about biohazards & prices. Lucy's dad was upset it was so damn late coming home but emotions are alright and we're both safe.

Mark texted throughout the night, and I asked him if we could drive by and get $40 in the morning. It's a far drive and now it seems like I'm an asshole for asking. Mark overdid it, but I'm sure a bad trip is worse than cleaning throw up out of a car.

WIBTA to go and collect $40? Am I an asshole for taking what he's already given me?

c67l75	2019-06-27 16:25:29	call-me-jane-doe	AITA for wanting to legally change my name against my parents wishes.	"Throwaway for reasons.

TL;DR at the bottom.

I come from a typical ethnic background where names are stupidly long and even more stupidly difficult to pronounce. My parents raised us abroad as they wanted to give myself and my siblings a better chance of a good future and I am forever grateful for this.

However, I want to change my name legally. I have four names. My first name has 12 letters. My middle name 7 and my last two names have 16 letters between the two. All up, I have 35 letters in my name. 

More letters than the blasted English alphabet. Ironically enough in my parents native language, we only have 14 letters in the alphabet.

Throughout my life I have used a shortened version of my first name and opted to only use the shorter of my two last names. It's been a constant inconvenient pain. From trying to fill out forms to having to spell out names to strangers over the phone to my names never being able to be fully printed out on cards because they're too. Freaking. Long.

I have thought about legally changing my name for the last few years so this is not just a whim of a decision. I wish to legally erase my middle name, second last name and shorten my first name.

So I texted my mum to see if she had my original birth certificate and when she asked what it was for, I told her. In the past we have always made jokes about my name and my mum has always shrugged it off when I have mentioned having it legally changed and made comments such as ""whatever you choose to do, it's your life"".  

Howeve she was not too happy when I told her my plans and why. She has since told my dad and now both my parents are upset, my dad more so as he was the one who named me. I was christened after my paternal Grandmother and my two last names are in honour of my paternal Grandfather. 

I am not close nor have any emotional attachments to either my paternal Grandmother or Grandfather. My mum often took us to her family growing up and subsequently, I grew a far deeper bond towards my maternal Grandparents. 
The other issue I have is that said Grandmother only passed away last month. My mum and siblings both think I'm an insensitive asshole towards my dad for wanting to change my name so soon after the passing of his mother.

Now my parents have threatened not to attend my graduation if I go ahead with the change and I would be devastated not to have them there as I've always been close to my parents. However regardless of what name I choose to put on the degree, I still want to legally change my name as I feel life will be a little more simpler with having a nine letter name.

So AITA for going against my parents wishes?

TL;DR: Grew up with a 35 letter name, wanting to legally shorten it both for career and personal reasons but parents are against it and are threatening to boycott uni graduation."	Not the A-hole	0	0

If we die tomorrow our state would be in the high six figures. If we die when we hope we die it’s well into the seven figures. We won’t have kids and just assume we will die in our 70’s. At that time her brother and my brother would be in their 60’s. My brothers kids would be in their 50’s and so would my wife’s brothers kids. We also assume they’ll have what they need in life. If not then they did something wrong and oh well. 

We recently made a will and are leaving our entire estate, money, life insurance, everything to The Ronald McDonald House. My brother is pissed. He thinks he and especially his kids should be in the will. My wife’s brother actually thought it was cool we would do that. His reaction was so refreshing that we actually changed the will so he or his kids (if he has any) would get our house and the contents. We told him we changed it to reflect that strictly because he didn’t think it was bad we “left him out” originally and thought it was very generous we would give our estate to charity. He’s only 22. 

Now I’m concerned that I’m a huge asshole because we are leaving our house and contents to my wife’s brother/his family and nothing to my brother or his family. I hope that makes sense.

They have over $20,000 of my money in their bank account for “safe keeping” (money from a lawsuit years ago that ended in my favor) and refuse to let me have access to it in fear that I’ll spend all of it. 

Being a senior in college with no current source of income (I plan to get a job in the coming months), my parents give me $100 every week (of my money) to spend. Often enough though, with the purchase groceries, toiletries, and workout supplements, I will use all of that money as soon as it is transferred.

So fast forward to last night, I was out with friends, and I check my bank account to find a whooping total of $0.00 in there. Not wanting to back out of another night, I texted my sister asking for $12, promising to pay her back in the coming days. When she asked why, I said I would explain later. But she insisted, so I quickly lied to her saying I was going to get gas. She’s pretty straightedge and wouldn’t have given me money to get drinks. 

So she transfers me the money, and within 10 minutes I have both my parents calling to yell at me for lying to my sister for money. 

My sister makes $80,000 a year and is pissed at me for borrowing 12 goddamn dollars. I have over 20 grand to my name but can’t afford to go out for drinks with my friends. 

I get that I shouldn’t have lied for the money, no matter how small the amount. But my argument is that I shouldn’t have to lie, give me access to my money and let me make the big boy decision on how to spend it."	Asshole	0	0
c67hq0	2019-06-27 16:17:19		Aita for not wanting to quit aita because my boyf thinks it will cause drama in our lives?	"I am into yoga, pilates, ballet, dance, eating well, skincare addiction subreddit, book club, sewing, becoming minimal and mentoring people. I'm pretty chatty but also love alone time. I get a real kick out of realbeesfaketophats and hydrohomies.

I don't drink smoke or do drugs. Grandmas love me, dogs love me, people trust me with their kids and I am a very great choice for a plus one.  I love learning languages and random facts. 

I am basic AF and probably boring as hell. 

I don't start fights, don't go into flame wars and have never once thrown a shoe. I watch very little reality tv and for the lols only. I don't go onto gossip websites or talk about celebrities like I know them. 

But. 

I LOVE aita. I love thinking about both sides of topics especially when they aren't clear cut. 

I find it a fascinating look into people and I think the answers say more about the people responding than the actual question. 

Often, I ask a friend or my boyf 'this was a good one on aita, what would your answer be?' and it is mostly friendly and comes up with some good chat. We don't live together. 

I get to see perspectives I hadn't thought of and from completely different genders and ages. 

HOWEVER. my boyf of almost a year is freaking out. He says that this is a prelude to me becoming more dramatic that clearly I seek drama in my life and that I will start to bleed this into my real life. That he worries that he isn't seeing 'all of me' and that the real me has to have constant drama or else I wont be satisfied. That I will start to need drama in my everyday and find that by blowing up issues that were minor issues. He has pointed out us debating hotly on a few of them as proof that I am taking this sub too seriously. 

He says that this is unhealthy behaviour and that I need to stop reading aita and focus on other more important things in my life and use the time more wisely not on a 'gossip site'. 

I think he is being dramatic himself. Yes I'll admit I enjoy this subreddit but this isn't crack. I don't want to quit. My life is very quiet and tbh I kind of get bored. I get to live vicariously through you people sometimes. 

This is not a validation post because I worry that he might have a point. I really do enjoy reading this sub and getting into the nitty gritty. I  would really like to know aita for not quitting aita? 

Tldr I love aita and my boyfriend worries this is a prelude to becoming dramatic."		1	0

I've been invited to a friend's (I'll call her A) party that is coming up, a mutual friend (I'll call her B) of ours is hosting it, along with 3 other girls, in honor of A. Well, B asked me if I wanted to help with the party, and instantly I had the feeling I was getting one of their tasks put on me. Feeling the need to be a ""good friend"", I asked what I could help with. B gave me a list of stuff, worth around $60, for me to get for drinks. Well, B had just told me they were at the store, so I said they should have grabbed the stuff then. They came up with some reasons on why they didn't have time. Also, that one of the other hosts oversees drinks and didn't include these drinks (not sure why I'm getting supplies for drinks that were not chosen by the person in charge of drinks?). I have already spent a good amount of money on gifts for A (over $100) and I really don't feel, as a guest, I should be spending more money. Mind you, this party is right around the corner, and I have had no part of it other than being a guest (which I prefer). So, I guess, my questions are, am I the asshole for not helping to a friend that might be just trying to include me? Or am I not the asshole for saying no to a friend that is throwing a task on me?"

c67gmc	2019-06-27 16:14:56	VladZxc	AITA For basically (unintentionally) ruining a picnic?	"So , I'm in highschool and this girl said that we should have a picnic on the day  school ends. We were gonna bring money and she was going to buy food and stuff and we were supposed to go in a popular bbq and picnic zone near our city. 

So , we made an Whatsapp group chat , and we started chatting about random stuff as well as the actual picnic. 

Now , I'm going to have to give you some background on this. In my country , there is a certain genre of music influenced by Turkish and Arabic music , as well as Latino. But the lyrics are mostly about money food and women. Stuff that I don't enjoy listening to at all. 

So , at one certain moment in the Whatsapp group chat that I was talking about , I said "" I *hope* you guys aren't going to put on that kind of music "". One guy proceeded to ask me how can I not like this kind of music. I told him I just don't like it , someone else asked me if I have never danced on it( it has a very definite rhythm , so it is easy to dance on , but I just don't enjoy it). After this, another guy said he doesn't like it either.

And then , out of the blue , with no real explanation , nothing really , the first guy left the group chat, followed by another guy.

Now , after a while , the girl who organized it all(for clarification she is/was  a close friend of  mine) send me a message in which she asked of me not to play any rock ( that's the genre I listen to and am somewhat known for it) on the picnic. I didn't find this a fair request , If I couldn't play my music why should they?

 Anyway , I already knew they were gonna play the music anyways and at this point it was just an argument of principles and opinions with her( at least on my side). 

But soon enough she sent a big , caps locked message in the group chat announcing there wasn't gonna be a picnic anymore( that is , after postponing it twice because someone couldn't make it) and kicked us all out of the group. 

What I think happened is that those guys complained to her about it , and apparently she decided we shouldn't have a picnic anymore.

And now , everyone blames me and calls me names after I just expressed my opinion. Probably those guys got offended , but I never said it anything like ""THERE SHALL BE NO MUSIC LIKE THAT AT THE PICNIC"" or anything. I just expressed my honest opinion. And as long as I could play my own music too , I didn't really care about it, but then she asked me not to do even that. 

She could've asked me not to come or something , not cancel the whole damn thing.

For clarification: I was not a host of the event or anything. She was the only one doing this , so what I said was no rule , it was just my opinion. I said **I** don't like it , not that they shouldn't like it or that they shouldn't play it. 

Oh and it was never a vote or anything. I didn't overreact over a decision of the majority , I just expressed my own opinion and that was it.

And now almost everyone blames me on everything.

c67f7l	2019-06-27 16:11:42	Throw_it_away__again	AITA for refusing to spend time with my 'reformed' father in law?	"Side note, I was mildly abused at home as a child, and my wife, Jill, hates my family for it. I'm totally fine with this.

Jill's parents split when she was very small.  Her mom stayed here in the Midwest while her dad went off to Florida for a change of scenery.  Jill would go spend every summer growing up with her dad in Florida, where she had an absolute blast because she basically had no rules and got to do whatever she wanted.  

She got to do whatever she wanted because her father had an endless supply of money from selling drugs, and he was too high, drunk, or both, to enforce any rules.  If she had a bedtime at all, it was only because he wanted to get high in the house.

Example: Jill learned to drive back in the early 90s at 9 years old because dad was too drunk to drive to the meetup to his cocaine supplier. 

Jill is super close to her father to this day, and they video chat almost weekly for about an hour at a time.  She looks back on her summers in Florida very fondly, where I can only be horrified by how irresponsible and reckless her father was.  She was a child allowed to roam the streets at all hours of the night, and her father would have had no idea if something had happened to her because he was too high to care!

Jill as an adult is very driven and she's kicking ass at her career.  She doesn't party hard, she doesn't do drugs, she's exceedingly focused on excelling at everything.  And her dad is so. Damn. Proud.  He gushes about her to everyone he meets.  He comes to visit us often and begs us to come down to Florida all the time.

I can't stand him.  Every time I look at him I think about the danger he put her in, and he can't shut up about how good a job he did in raising her. It's to the point where, when he visits, I often have Jill just go see him by herself so I don't have to see his face.  I'm avoiding going to Florida.

He's noticed that I'm extremely cool toward him, and he's apparently sad that I don't like him.  Jill wants me to try harder, because he loves her so much and he's 'changed' (supposedly he can't do drugs anymore because of health issues that have cropped up in the last 10 years).

I don't keep her from visiting him, although I wish she wouldn't.  I just want nothing to do with him.  Jill is becoming aggravated that I won't bend on this.  AITA?

Follow-up question I should have included the first time: we don't currently have kids, but we're talking about it.  I don't think I'd want my kid anywhere near this guy alone, but he's expressed interest in babysitting for us.  AITA for thinking ""absolutely-fucking-NOT""?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c67e4z	2019-06-27 16:09:22	Lady__stoneheart	AITA for not scolding (?) my niece for saying hurtful things back at my cousin who was bullying her by saying similarly hurtful things?	"Hey!

Bit of a background. I'm from India and so are everyone involved in this. One of my super extended family on my mother's side (think my grandma's cousin's daughter's family) was facing crisis for the last few months. By relations she is my cousin but I'll refer to her as my niece's mom henceforth. Her husband had cancer and he passed away last month. His treatment was being done at a hospital in the city me and family live in, so my cousin and her daughter (my niece) used to visit us sometimes. My niece would stay with us sometimes if her father had to stay in the hospital for longer periods. 

After her father passed away, my niece and her mom visited us on Monday. Her mom had to payback some money she had borrowed from my family or something. But one of my younger cousins was staying with us too. Both the girls are around the same age and both are in 8th grade. 

My younger cousin is known to be mean. She is adopted so everyone takes it easy on her (for the time being they say) since she was told about her adoption just last year. I was supposed to be keeping them company but I wasn't paying a lot of attention. 

Something happened between both and they started arguing and saying things like you're fat/your hair's greasy etc. I asked them to knock it off. Then my cousin started taunting my niece by saying that her father has passed away, she's half an orphan, she should keep close to mommy or else she'll be a full orphan, etc. Before I could ask her to shut up and apologise, my niece said ""You're lucky if you were an orphan. Otherwise you're just a piece of trash which wasn't even wanted by your real parents and they threw you out."" And she went out the room. 

My cousin ran out and went to other room and started crying. I didn't say anything then because I didn't want my niece's mother to scold my niece especially because of what had triggered her reply. I planned to talk to my cousin later and try to make her understand why what both of them did was wrong and make them call each other and apologize. So the matter would be solved without having anyone's parents being involved. 

But my uncle called that night and told my parents that they'd be coming early next morning to take away my cousin because I don't care enough about her and they don't want to be a family with someone like me. So turns out my cousin called her parents and told them the story making her the sole victim. I let my uncle know what happened, he said we'll talk tomorrow. The next day, they didn't even bother to see the full picture and called me an asshole. In a fit of rage I told my uncle that they should teach their daughter that if she should dish out only as much as she can handle herself. That promoted them to saying that I support what was said and that I hate her(cousin) because she isn't blood.

      The problem is, she has been telling me lies and disgusting things about my sister. Recently she told me she told them to my mother, because, as a mother herself she would want to know the thruth about her own daughter (6F). 
      During final season, she brought her daughter to the house almost every single day and just made small talk with my mother while the daughter runs around, screams, jumps on the beds, throws things around, not once she told her to stop. It got so bad my sister had to go study to my grandmas house.
      It feels like she has a secret hate towards my sister. Yet, somehow she wants me and her to spend the holidays? She even said she would leave her car for us to drive around.
      Now, she accepted a job far away, and only comes the weekends, the daughter is with the father and grandmother but due to their work she ends up in the neighbors house a lot. But now she wants to take her.
      And this is where it all makes sense, she wants me and my sister to take care of her demon child while she works.
      She is living in a 2 bedroom house, with her new boyfriend, 1 bedroom for her and her boyfriend, the other she is furnishing for her daughter... So where would we sleep? The couch, maybe the floor?
      I can't stand it anymore, I don't want to take care of her demon child, I don't want to be cooking and caring for her, and sure as hell I can't stand another lie about my sister coming out her foul mouth.

c679gd	2019-06-27 15:58:53		AITA for making this joke?	"So my friend (22) I met 6 months ago blocked me over a joke. We got really close with eachother and we shared personal things too. At first she sent me nudes and stuff but regardless of that. She usually doesn't talk to guys any further than that. But I got to know her more and she would tell me things like how she had mental breakdowns and stuff. So I was always there for her. We even played video games late at night despite the crazy time zones. 


Now I adore her, like I rarely connect to people so I really valued this friendship. So to open up to her like this and be blocked, frankly it hurts so much. Its like 6 months of understanding everything about her and she doesn't give a fuck. She is depressed and is a huge introvert, she is probably going through a bad time. So hence why I was trying to cheer her up. The joke was how someone uploaded a vid of her (I guess this part made it sound sketchy) and that its her gameplay compilation (she plays video games as I mentioned). I guess things got worse one time she lashed out on me for being annoying.


She said she found this really annoying, how were not friends and that she doesn't feel like joking around with me. She said how I could've just asked how she was feeling. I apologised, I even said how I don't go out of my way to talk to people because I don't really like getting to know people. That I found her when I was entertaining myself (met her on this app). She said how I made it seem like its a privilege to talk to and that she doesn't want to talk anymore. Besides this entire thing blowing up. I can't help but feel that she never gave me a reason why she wants to stop talking... like all because of a joke? Am I that bad of a person?"		1	0
c678qj	2019-06-27 15:57:10	_Rather_Confused	AITA unfriended someone because she constantly puts herself in a rut and cannot take feedback.	"Hi there,

I have a lovely friend who is one of the nicest people I know. Me and her are like two inseparable peas in a pod and we're very close, which kind of created this issue for me.

On the flip side she is her own worst enemy. Every problem she ever faces is all self inflicted and every 3-4 weeks she spirals out of control as all her poor decisions cripple her to the point of being sick. I'll just list them off.

She is a people pleaser to the nth degree and she stretches herself so thin that it socially exhausts her to the point of isolating herself for days at a time.

She knows drinking gives her crippling anxiety; however, when she stops drinking for a week or two and feels better, she forgets and then goes out with her bad influence friends (cause she can't say no) gets absolutely wasted and she falls into life ruining anxiety.

She has insane money problems and maxes out each credit card. She owes like 3 different people thousands of dollars as well as student loans, etc. Credit card companies raise her limit and she sees it as opportunity to blow even more.

She is addicted to her phone. She gets this idea she'll only use a non-smart phone daily to halt her addiction and spends a bunch of money. The idea lasts 2 days and she is back on her smart phone because she apparently has to be at everyone beck and call to 'please them'.

Awful guys pray on her, and she knows it. Doesn't even like them but she can't say no so it leaves her open for manipulation and very controlling men. This compounds things.

The list goes on and on and on. And as all her poor decisions pile up from prior weeks she becomes a hypochondriac and constantly thinks she has cancer. She finally implodes and isolates in her apartment for a week or two. Hates her life so much that she comes out with this new energy to change and she DOES!

I constantly help her through all of this. I believe her when she says she'll change and I'm there! But the cycle repeats so much I finally started calling her out and telling her she is her own worst enemy. She takes defense to everything I say and a rather significant argument erupts. She tells me no other friend talks to her this way and I told her that is because her friends don't care for her and any friend that did, would point out how her lifestyle is ruining her life.

Am I an asshole for leaving her? I basically delete blocked her on all social media because I don't have an interest in just being some superficial friend to her. I believe we are a summation of all the people we surround ourselves with and she is taking a place in my life where someone healthier can hold. Is that selfish? She was literally my best friend and we'd talk daily. Now she's gone."	No A-holes here	0	0

Earlier today I was having a conversation with my co-worker about upcoming changes at our workplace. In the middle of the conversation he reaches down and scratches his family jewels right in-front me. In an admittedly snarky or sarcastic tone I exclaimed, ""really dude?"" ""You're going to do that right in-front of me?"" He immediately seemed bewildered and offended by my remark to which he replied with, ""What do you mean?"" ""I'm a dude, it's natural."" I could tell by the tone of his voice and his mannerisms that he took offense to my objection; additionally, to avoid any escalation or conflict I played it off as a joke and walked away. I could feel the awkwardness and tenseness in the air.

Am I the asshole in this situation? Perhaps my knee-jerk, snarky remark set off most of the response, but is it wrong to not feel comfortable with a person scratching their junk in-front of you? He's a good friend, but I would never scratch my balls in-front of him. To me, it's like ripping a fart next to someone-- it's rude and distasteful."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6761n	2019-06-27 15:51:08	loverookie95	AITA for not wanting to go on vacation with my husbands family?	"I want to start off by saying, I love my husbands family. I really do. His sister is my age so we always hang out. I am a nurse so getting vacation is hit or miss. I got a week off in August, and my husband also got approved for that week off. Anyways. I asked my SIL if she, her baby (18mo) and her babydad would want to go to the beach with us (baby would be included as well). That turned into her inviting: her sister, her sisters boyfriend, her mom, who decided she would bring along two other grand children. They then proceeded to book a hotel to someplace I said I did NOT want to go to.. and now my husband doesn’t understand why I told him I’m not going. 

My husband and I do not have children, nor do I want kids in the future. So going on vacation with three screaming crying children who need constant supervision, nap time, go to sleep early, wake up early and never shut up sounds more like a form of torture than it sounds like a vacation. I understand that we won’t be responsible for the children and we get our own bedroom, but I don’t want to be around them 24/7, let alone sharing a hotel, as hotel walls are thin and I like to sleep in. I also simply don’t want to go to the beach that they booked. And if I’m paying for myself and my husband, I should get to go where I want.

My girlfriend has pretty much been living with me for over a year. She does have an apartment which she pays rent for so she wasn't officially moved in. Fast forward and she's moved all her stuff in, she's trying to find someone to sublease her apartment. I work a full time job and make decent money. I have my own apartment and car. She however doesn't have a car, so my days off are spent running errands. I pay for pretty much everything except she does split groceries. We're a pretty good couple but one thing we fight about is chores. In my opinion since she's at my apartment all day, she should be cleaning it and cooking, I'm pretty much just home for a couple hours before going to bed. She sees that as being taken advantage of, let me say, she doesn't work, she's not currently in school, and doesn't contribute financially. She complains about having to cook, do laundry, clean. And she does the bare minimum, dishes that are dirty are put up. Im getting tired of it. Am I the asshole for expecting her to at least clean and cook because she's home all day every day?

I am a sensible 35 year old woman. No drinking, no smoking and no drugs. I don't 'party hard' nor am I a 'woo girl'. Never been in a fight, never thrown a stiletto, or had a speeding fine. 

Basically I'm basic af. 

I love eating right, yoga, ballet, sewing, my book club, foreign films and learning new languages.

I even look elegant with a grace kelly vibe. People trust me with their kids, grandmas love me and I am a great plus one for any event. 

So my issue is that my partner doesn't like me reading aita. 

He says that it is promoting drama, and that this could bleed onto our lives and that I could become dramatic, emotional and start to become like the people who post. He accuses me of spending 'all my free time' here and of getting far too involved with the drama. He says that this is a precident for how I will act in the future and that maybe he just hasn't seen that side of me yet since we have never lived together. He says that I talk about it too much and that I clearly have a need for drama that is fulfilled through this

Now if I was the type of woman who referred to celebrities by their first names or read tmz or got into twitter beefs I would get it. 

How is this not a validation post? Because I LOVE the drama here. I love picking one out and reading it to my friends"		1	0

"Please note, my mother in law has late stage Alzheimer's, and we're to the point where we're just ""waiting"" for her to go into a facility (we're just waiting on my FIL to decide when he is ready). It's a sensitive topic with members in the family, so I try to avoid bringing it up (it's a conversation people aren't ready to discuss, and even though I'm married into the family, it isn't my decision to make).   


We're heading on a family road trip to visit with some of my husband's family, and the car ride is about 6 hours each way. The plan is for all of us (me, FIL, MIL, husband and SIL) to ride together in a larger vehicle.   


I battle anxiety on the daily, so it isn't weird for me to possibly ""overthink"" something prior to it happening, however, this is almost a month away and I'm quite nervous.   


My MIL is incontinent and only uses diapers (and, with her stage of Alzheimer's she cannot communicate when she has used them, and does NOT want to be taken out of them once soiled). My FIL is a bit scatterbrained, and will put things off to the last minute, so I'm dreading the possibility of being stuck in a vehicle for 6+ hours with well, shit?   


In addition, I'm also a little nervous about the possibility of these thing being put on me (I am uncomfortable having my husband or his sister having to take care of these things) - my FIL won't be able to go into a women's restroom, and I can. I've been in charge of changing her in the past, however, it is a very long, drawn out experience, she gets quite sassy (pinching, light hits, yelling) and she won't sit still - so things get.... around. 

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for wanting to drive separately and avoid this? How do I approach my in-laws in a ""kind"" way to avoid this car ride? I've going on this car ride before while she was ""with it"", so they know I'm not prone to being car sick, etc. (Trust me, I already  thought about it...)"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c674k8	2019-06-27 15:47:42	c-crook	AITA for not inviting my friend to impromptu brunch?	"I recently had a birthday. To celebrate, I invited my friends to go dancing. It was a fun night, nothing crazy. We all drank and danced. By 1am, I was practically falling over and ready to go home.

As usual, I got a massive hangover. No amount of hydration/food before falling asleep drunk ever helps. So my friend, Layla, who had spent the night, offered to take me out for brunch. It was just three of us - me, Layla, and my boyfriend. It was a good time.

Layla later told me that my other friend, Stella, got mad we didn't invite her to brunch (they live together). She was also at the club the previous night. The three of us have been friends for ages, so I do feel kind of bad, but at the time I was just thinking about nursing my hangover. We also all aren't *that* close anymore - like, I would drop anything for each of them in a heartbeat if they needed my help, but as we're all now adults, it's hard to find/make time for each other unless it's made in advance.

Additionally, Stella and Layla live 40 minutes away on a good day of city traffic. Don't know if this detail matters, but my reasoning is that even if I had considered inviting her, we'd have to wait for her to get there, and I was kinda dying with my hangover, which, again, is why I didn't think to invite her.

Now, since I haven't actually talked to Stella since the club, I don't really know how angry she is. I'm not very socially active, so I don't text much or communicate via social media. I kind of usually just hit up my friends once or twice every couple months for miscellaneous activities. She didn't actually text me 'happy birthday' on my actual birthday (which came on a day after the club/brunch), so I'm low-key upset about it.

She also usually cuts my hair, and I'm due for a haircut which I planned for this weekend (or next), but am now unsure if I should. Usually I book an appointment via an app, she approves, and I go (no actual texting involved). Should I book the appointment anyway? (That way I'll know she's truly upset if she declines it.)

Another detail that might be relevant: Stella and I didn't have much 1-on-1 time at the club. In my defense, I was mostly focused on drinking + dancing, but I did inadvertently give other friends attention, like for smoke breaks and getting drink breaks. In retrospect, I feel bad about it, but it's not like I did it on purpose - it was mostly situational. Like, me and another friend both finished our drinks, so we went to get more. There's also only one other smoker, so obviously I'm gonna go outside with them. But she could've propositioned things too? Like, it's my birthday, so buy me a shot?? Then we can sit at the bar for 5 minutes and talk shit about our boyfriends or something.

I asked her why and she said she wants a new insurance policy (I’m still on my parents’ insurance). She just got a new insurance policy three weeks ago, so I asked her why she was getting a new one.  I really didn’t mean this question any type of way, I was just curious because it sounded like a really good policy (for what little I know of insurance) and because of the new policy I am able to get an IUD not covered by the last one so I was excited to take advantage of that. She doesn’t know the last part and I didn’t mention it.  Plus, she didn’t need my SSN the last time she was shopping around for a new policy, so it struck me as odd that she suddenly needed it now. I do have my problems with my mother but I don’t think she’d do anything intentionally malicious. I was just curious about what my SSN was needed for and why. I did tell her what it was. She collected other information she needed to call for quotes. The entire phone conversation took less than 5 minutes. 

My dad immediately called me to rip into me about being a bitch to my mom and that “when she asks you a question you answer. You don’t ask her anything”.  He added that I either needed to make her day easier with instant answers or get my own policy immediately. He finished with I was ungrateful child who isn’t smart enough to know what’s good for her and they didn’t need me to be making their lives any harder by asking questions. 

I really didn’t think I was rude to my mother and maybe it’s none of my business why she’s switching policies again because they’re generous enough to allow me to remain on theirs, but my parents and I are usually very open with conversations like this.

&#x200B;

I was recently invited to a school event and had to fill out a survey of information, including any dietary restrictions, because it's a fancier event which will serve dinner. When I filled out the survey, I clicked the box 'vegan' for dietary restrictions. There was an option for vegetarian but no option for dairy-free. 

One of my friends said essentially I was TA for doing that because it's a lie, but honestly I find it a little complicated to explain my dietary restrictions. To me, it's not hard to understand but a lot of people have a hard time understanding that I'm a vegetarian but don't eat dairy either, and I really don't want to get sick from eating dairy milk or butter which is why I often say I'm vegan for things like this because it just makes it easier. 

AITA for saying I'm vegan for things like this when I'm not? IRL when people ask about my diet (if they do/if it comes up), I usually say I'm vegetarian but no dairy and I have a chance to explain it or I'll just say plant-based."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c66yia	2019-06-27 15:33:37		WIBTA if I backed out of a favour after I already said yes?	"TL;DR at bottom;

I'm a University student currently between years, I'll start my next year at the end of this September, and I work part time. I live with my partner who works full time. 

A few months ago, my mum asked if I could watch her elderly dog for her whilst she goes on holiday to visit a good friend in Australia. 
At this point, I thought it would only be 1-2 weeks and I didn't know what month she would be going so I said yes, sure. 

I've recently found out that she's already booked the flights and is going at the end of September (right when I start Uni) for a month. 
She didn't check with me before booking and has chosen the worst dates for me (I asked her to try and avoid September if possible). 
Because of this, there's a number of reasons I do not want to look after the dog for a month;

- Partner & I will be out most of the day, leaving dog alone. He's old, has health problems and separation anxiety. He would be very unhappy. 

- We have a cat who *hates* the dog. It would cause her a lot of stress to have him here for a full month. 

- It will distract me from my first month of uni, and cause partner & I to miss out on social events because we can't leave him alone too long. 

- Our tenancy agreement states we're not allowed dogs. A lot of our neighbours personally know our landlord and may complain (Because of this my mother asked us to stay at her house with the dog, but it's a 40min round trip from work/uni and would be expensive to travel)

- We love the dog to pieces, but he's old, smelly, sheds fur everywhere and has digestion problems so it's more than likely he'll have a few 'accidents' inside our apartment. We like to keep things clean and tidy so that would stress us out. 


With all that in mind, I feel like I'd want to back out and say we're actually too busy to have him for a full month, even though I already said yes a while back (although I didn't know the full details then). I'd be happy to help for a week, two at most, but it'd be a huge ask IMO. 

I've vocalised this to my sister and she says I'm being selfish and silly, and if I don't help my mum and her will be really upset with me and won't help me if I ever need a favour. 
Also, if I don't have the dog, she'll probably still go and the dog will have to stay elsewhere with strangers or professionals, which would cause him a lot of stress as he doesn't like strangers. 

So my question is, if I do back out and say I'd rather not have him for a whole month, WIBTA?
Thank you


TL;DR: said yes to dog-sitting a few months ago. After finding out more details I want to back out / take a smaller part in helping. AITA?"		1	0

I cancelled going there last minute and he got so pissed.

I told him that I just didn't feel like going and  eventually even offered going to the sleepover but without the sleepover but and that I would come home just before the actual sleeping so that I wouldn't miss anything.

I told him in a call and he got really pissed and just ended it.

"So a bit of backstory; my parents split in december of 2018 because my father cheated on my mom with one of his coworkers, lied about it for months and when she wanted to work on things he would get angry and leave the house (we all assumed to the other womens house). Since then both of my parents have been ""broke"" because as my fathers child support for me and my 2 brothers he pays the rent for our house and then his apartment on top of that. My mom works 2 jobs to make ends meet for us and my dad tries his best, he spends his money on weed and cigarettes then by the end of the week he only has so much money for food and he ends up going to the dollar store. My mom buys the things we need first then she get US the luxuries maybe herself sometimes too. 

(Story)
My father has always been kind of abusive towards me (not physically but emotionally). He would always yell at me telling me that im a liar and a manipulator and that I'd be lonely at 40 just like him and we'd have arguments with me ending up in tears and him yelling at me more for crying. But yesterday took the cake. It's the summertime where i live and yesterday was super hot. I went to my boyfriend's house for a bit and my mom told me to go to my dads house for dinner because i hadn't seen him all week. I told her i would and around 6 i decided to start walking. It was like 30⁰C and i was in sweatpants and a sweater. After 15 minutes of walking i finally got to my dad's house and hi to my brother and my dad and i only got on back from my younger brother. I walked to the fridge and grabbed the last pepsi and sat down on the couch next to my dad. 15 minutes passed and the first thing he said to me was ""is that the last f*cking pop"" and told him yea and he said ""of course it is because you're so selfish to drink the last pop and didnt think i would've wanted it"" and i was just trying to defend myself at this point. He told me he didn't know why i even went to his house so i got up and left and while i walked down the hallway he shouted at me it takes 2 people to make a relationship and about 2 minutes later he texted me saying that i used him and didnt actually care about him and that i was just a manipulator.

I went to interview at this one specific place and they said they liked me and that I needed to send over three letters of reference. In my field, the reference letters can only come from very specific people. I told her that as a graduate with no work experience, I did not have three. I have only two. She said that she is required to have three or they cannot even consider me to be hired. I told them thank you for your time, I'll see if I can get another reference letter.

I didn't get another reference letter. In fact, I got hired somewhere else. I keep getting phone calls every other day from the job, looking for a follow up. I was never offered a position, they never even flat out said that they wanted to hire me.. just that they needed my reference letters. At the interview, I said I would TRY to get them. That's it. No commitments either way. 

They didn't contact me for almost two months, and now they're suddenly super interested, bombarding my phone and I'm basically ignoring it.

Am I the asshole for not answering and just telling them I am not interested? I thought it was pretty clear after the conversation we had face to face at the interview. I'm terrible at confrontation in a professional setting and so I realize ghosting might make me an asshole, but at the same time I'm not sure because there was no commitment promised on either end."

I posted my couch onto a bunch of sites such as offer up, letgo, Facebook. My first bite came from one of the apps telling me to email someone, I assumed the guys mother (we’ll call her Cindy). I email her explaining that I need the couch gone this week as I am moving and I will need it picked up no later than Sunday. She explains that she is out of town but is willing to send me a certified check and willing to arrange for movers to come pick it up. Cindy wants to send me a check with the cost of the couch plus the cost of the movers, then I pay the movers whatever they quoted her. I tell Cindy that I am ok with all of that, I just really need confirmation that it will be gone by Sunday at the very latest. Cindy says that yes, she can arrange that. I give her my info and she says ok.

A day goes by and I do not hear anything from Cindy, so I email her again confirming that she is sending the check and ask her when I should expect the movers. Cindy says that her son was arranging a courier service to deliver, and will send me the tracking number whenever she has it. Cindy has still not mentioned anything about the movers. 

So today, Thursday, I still have not back from Cindy. My friend, we’ll call her Kate, texts me and asks if the couch is still available because I had mentioned it to her a couple days back. Kate’s roommate is moving in on Friday so will have a moving truck and can come pick it up in the evening on Friday, which is perfect timing for me. So I email Cindy again and explain that I am worried that with her lack of communication  it will not get picked up in time and I am going to sell it to my friend. I have told her that I will reimburse however she needs me to if she already paid for a courier and that I will destroy the check if she has already sent it.

My \[25M\] ex-GF \[24f\] cheated on me with Pete (fake name obviously) in early stages of our relationship. I found out about it at the end, I wanted to fix things, she didn't. 

I suspected she was already laying grounds for next relationship (with Charles) at the end (same story with me and her previous ex but nvm) and as of now I'm 99% convinced they are together since the very same day we broke up.

Now I have very little reasons to trust her and as the dust settles I start to see what kind of person she really was so I'm starting to think about contacting Pete and asking him his version of the story (I know the guy, met him on the University once, we aren't friends or anything so doubt he knew she was in a relationship during thier hook-up, she as well said he didn't).

Why do I want to do it:

\- want to verify what is the truth,

\- stop thinking about her feelings and do something for myself,

\- somehow I think he also deserves to know she was in a relationship back then (he ignored her for few days, then contacted her again, she basically said him to fuck off, didn't mention she was with me),

\- I don't know but I feel like this might be a way to close this chapter?

Reasons not to:

\- it might be petty and unnecessary while might hurt her,

\- maybe some part of me wants to make her face the consequences of her actions? (not sure if it's true - I'm confused),

\- it's been 2 months since a break up so why bother?

Please hear me out before the judgement commences!! \*Obligatory 1st time poster/throwaway\*

I have been with my boyfriend now for almost 2 years. Last year on my birthday we were saving up money for a trip, so while we celebrated, we did so very lightly and I was 100% okay. We have a group of friends, however they are all his friends. I get along with a few but for the most part I dislike them for various reasons. I like to make sure he gets plenty of time with his friends and he isn't always expected to be with me every single weekend. Mainly to make up for the fact, I rarely ever want to spend my own time with them. For his birthday, I knew he would obviously want to spend time with them, so while I had a private date planned for us, I made sure to coordinate with his friends so that they could all get together to go do whatever they do! When I was asked to join, I put on my happy face and went. The evening was fun and I enjoyed myself but as an introvert it was tiring, but I wasn't sorry I went.

As he tells it ""They all really like you and think you are hilarious"" (I was drinking in order to be more social) Well my birthday is in 2 weeks, right near the 4th of July. They are having a cookout party thing, I had already declined the invitation to the cookout once because of my own plans (stay home with my dog who is terrified of fireworks) But now they are starting to put pressure on me to come , saying things like ""We can make it for your birthday!"" I thanked them for thinking of me but told them AGAIN (about 3 times), I couldn't make it, but to go ahead with their plans! I even told my boyfriend he should go to the cookout, and that we can celebrate my birthday on another night. My boyfriend said I was a being an ""asshole"" his friends are trying to throw me a party and I should go.

My argument is mainly that it is NOT a party for me, it was already planned and declined by me as a cookout, so they are not trying to throw me a party, they are trying to guilt me into coming by saying they will turn it into a party for me, as if I am acting like a petulant child wanting attention when really I just didn't want to go. Normally, my bf accepts it when I don't want to go somewhere.

My boyfriend is adamant that I'm being a huge bitch because I'm always refusing to hang out with them (which imo is untrue, I make several attempts to include his friends or family just not every week, more like every month) and that I should accept their invitation to have a party for me. I don't pressure him to hanging with my friends, (which he’s never met) I wish he'd back off and stop pressuring me to hang out with his, ESPECIALLY on my birthday! This is our main sore spot in our relationship. I make every effort to see he gets the social interaction he needs, yet I am expected to not receive the same respect on my birthday!

I realize we're all technically competition, but I have no problem supporting other artists. Most people have no problem with this. They'll link to their posts in the chat and most everyone will go and like/comment on it. Others, however, will open chat and ignore everything. Never contribute, never say anything, just sort of freeloading. I haven't said anything yet, but I'm very tempted to. Instagram recently added the ability for admins to kick users from group chats.

The problem is I mentioned I had a crush and my friends were able to pressure me into admitting it was a friend in our group. The next day me and the friend sat down with one other friend to talk about it and I explained that I knew he was straight and would never take any action irl. He rightfully felt ackward since I mentioned I had masturbated to him. I tried to explain that I had self control and didn't bring my feelings into real life but he was very upset. He said that unless I swore to never sexually think about him again I would permanently destroy the entire friend group and he would not hang put with me as much as possible. I agreed to his demands but I was lying to his face because I was still very unsure. Should I not be able to have freedom of thought if I never bring it into real life?. He also started denying that I was gay and said that my emotions might be confusing me. Not really sure if im being selfish or if he's not willing to move on.


Edit: Just to clarify I told him I masturbate to him cause my other friend asked me if I did and I felt like there was little point of lying about it.


Edit2: I'm seeing a lot of posts about the detail about masturbation being disturbing (I agree). my dilemma is that my other friend who was a bystander put me on the spot in front of him and I felt bad about lying after already confessing this. In hindsight I probably should have lied and said no or said its non of his business.

Edit3: I just wanted to thank everyone for their responses and help in helping me clearly see everyones mistakes/misjudgements (including my own) in this mess. I really appreciate the time and effort people have put into their responses."		0	0

I was going to split a room with my buddy John.  As it turns out, basically airfare and hotel would be roughly equal, so like $200 for flight and $200 for hotel per person. 

Well, due to random reasons, I'm now able to get 2 free plane tickets.   Would I be an asshole if I offered to cover the flight costs if he covered the rooms?  Does your judgment depend on whether I told him I had free tickets or not?  To be clear, he wouldn't be paying any more than he would have in the first place, its just I'd be essentially going for free. 

Also, if it matters, he makes a decent amount more than me"		1	0

c66hoz	2019-06-27 14:55:00	geosj	AITA for commenting on someone else's weight, when they would comment on mine?	"This happened a few months ago.

There is this chubby girl who was friends with me. She seemed normal and we got along alright during the years.

One day I was being polite and I said ""good morning"" to her. She laughed called me rude names, then ran off with her other friends. This was fine with me because I had nothing to loose, and she was just an extra person to talk to.

Of course, she did this over and over. One day I was so mad that I called her a ""b\*\*\*h"", and told her to leave me alone. After I let out what I wanted to say, I started to ignore her.

I am pretty skinny, but I'm fine with it.

&#x200B;

One day she came up to me and called me a ""skinny white boy,"" she would call me ""skin and bones"" and other rude names. Until I just said ""What are you coming to me for? Weight Watchers is down the street!"" She started to cry, and got really upset. But this is exactly how I felt when she would call me rude names.

&#x200B;

After the incidents we went through periods of talking to each other again. She would talk to me for 5 days, then would start crying saying I did something wrong. Or she would just block me all together.

There was one point where we were in a phase for 2 weeks, then she had to say ""You know we aren't friends, we just talk to each other to talk to each other.""

&#x200B;

It all continued until this month she would start dancing at me and giving me the middle finger. Her friends would harass me and be rude to me.

One of her friends put a slimy piece of gum on my neck.

EDIT 1: And yes, she told me she likes me a long time ago!

Any time that she leaves the house for an extended period of time she expects my gf to stay there all day and watch them. I think that’s a bit over the top. I told her that these dogs are not her responsibility and that her roommate should board them if she really needs that much attention paid to the dogs. 

Another thing that irks me is that her roommate will be shitty to her if she doesn’t help her with her dogs. Like she expects my gf to essentially be there every waking second to take them out and feed them and play with them. It annoys my gf so much that she doesn’t want to live there anymore.

c66fq5	2019-06-27 14:50:07	ReverenceAsmodeus	AITA For Talking to my Best Friend's Girlfriend about Relationship Advice?	"So my friend B has a girlfriend (named C) whom I used to date in High School in our first year, it was never serious and I ended up breaking up with her because, by my own admission, I wasn't a serious or mature enough person to be able to date her and I really regretted not being able to be the type of guy she wanted. Recently B and C came to my house with a few others for a party I was throwing (very small get together with like 5-6 people throughout the night). After a few drinks her and I ended up talking about how I was upset over the fact that non of my love interests really seemed to reciprocate it and that I was just feeling a little worthless over it. To add some context my other friend was talking about the same stuff as me, being upset that he couldn't seem to find a girl who liked him. She did the standard friend thing of telling me that if I keep looking I'd be fine and that I wasn't worthless etc. I told her I really appreciated it and hoped I could be as happy as her and B one day.

&#x200B;

A week or so later I'm talking with B and out of the blue he asks me if I've got a thing for C. I tell him no, because obviously she's his gf and I wouldn't ruin our friendship by going after her. He tells me that he's relieved because the party made him think that her and I were seeing each other behind his back and that it seemed like she was interested in me despite the fact that I was just being plain depressing all night. He asked me to stop talking to her about my love life for his peace of mind (to which I agreed) but it really makes me wonder if I was overstepping our bounds in my friendship by talking with her about it. I think the way he interprets it is that when I broke up with her it was not because we weren't compatible (which we still aren't) but because I couldn't make her happy. Am I the asshole for talking to her about this, and should I avoid talking with my other friends gfs about it as well? (To further specify most of my friends gfs are also close friends of mine and I talk with them about things like this due to my own insecurity)."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I had plans with my coworker (42M) already, with timelines set and hotels booked. 

The morning of the trip my coworker walked in my office and said that him and his dad are waiting for me in the car. Apparently he decided to take his dad, who has a Alzheimer's with us. I felt trapped. Nothing against my coworkers dad, but I would feel akward the entire trip, especially since I didn't even know until the day of the trip.

I told him I felt uncomfortable and got another coworker of mine to go in my place who didn't seem to care.

I will go out and say from the get-go I'm not too fond of this guy, and neither is (as per conversations in groups and one-on-one) anyone else at the work place. That does include my bosses as well, who have openly said they dislike this person for a multitude of reasons.

When (I'll refer to him as Scoob) first got hired he checked off all the boxes as an employee that would fit in, and be a perfect addition to our crew. That was of course on paper, Scoob turned out to be a compulsive liar. To not exaggerate, Scoob, quite literally cost the company a couple thousand dollars in repair costs within his first couple of weeks on the job. For example, he would leave with said piece of equipment, come back with it and the next person to pick it up would bring it to a coworker and me, and let us know it was broken and needed to be fixed. 

When asked about all said equipment Scoob always says, ""it wasn't me, I found it like that."" Then the stealing of personal equipment started. All of a sudden the the equipment we use started disappearing I just figure the other guy in my department was using it and didn't think about it. Until one of our bosses came in and asked us if we had given it to Scoob to use. We were both shocked and said no. Of course we didn't do that and never would. I would report all of these to my bosses and let them know. They actually started making a journal of all the stuff Scoob has broken and lied about. That's how much there is.

c66dqk	2019-06-27 14:45:24	fear_of_government	AITA because I changed the agreement my cousin and I made before he moved in with me because he wasn't holding up his end of our deal?	"My cousin, we'll call him Joe(28M), and I(32M) grew up together. He got in with the wrong crowd and did some bad things that he ended up doing jail time for.

After jail time, Joe found success in crypto trading when the bubble was still booming and became a multimillionaire. At this point, we didn't really talk as he had moved away overseas and he didn't reach out. (I from time to time would reach out because his family would tell me that they didn't believe he was mentally in a good place.) I check in see what's up, and he would be short with responses, just saying that he's good.

Fast forward several years, he lost all the money he made, was living in a third world country, albeit in the nicest area the country has because the money he had was enough to live nicely, and a bit more receptive to talking.  He mentions that he's running out of money and will reluctantly come back to the states

In March I called things off with my gf and later in the month him and I agree to him moving in with me, Joe said that he didnt want to get between her and I and I assure him he wouldn't. 

**The Agreement**

* Find a job near home
* Help with Utilities/Food

He gets to the house and does not look for a job. He says that his job is the market(he said this a lot), but he wasn't making any money. I'm buying food with no help from him. He eats way more than me. He keeps all his electronics ON the entire 24/7. He sends me texts when I'm at work saying ""bring food"" meanwhile I'm getting no help

I remind him that we agreed he was going to look for a job and that I knew I was going to take a hit with my own finances(by not charging him rent) but I didn't think he wouldn't help at all. Nothing comes of it. Few weeks go by and my gf and I talked things through. Joe still hasn't helped but the crypto apparently saw a small surge and he was ecstatic and couldn't wait to tell me. He acted as if he had money and then asked me ""how much do I owe you?"" I tell him $500 and don't hear anything else.

Few days go by and he again tells me that his stuff is making money and I ask him when he planned on paying, this sets him off on a rant where he claims he's making $300 a day, accuses me of being jealous of his success, says that I said money wouldn't be an issue. and I'm flabberghasted. I only brought up payment after he asked how much.

A few more days go by and I tell him that I'm going to ask my gf to move in November time frame and in my head I feel that's ample time for him to pick himself up and get a place of his own. He starts raging saying that he told me to make sure I knew what I wanted(he's mad about the gf) and he still hadn't given me any money and I told him it felt like I was being used and reminded him he didn't hold up his end of our agreement from the beginning. He ended up leaving that same day and has since blocked me off everything. He gave me $700 for the month and 2 weeks he stayed with me(he also broke some of my stuff)"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c66dam	2019-06-27 14:44:13		AITA For Rejecting a Bisexual Man Because I am Straight? (Female)	"This actually happened three years ago when I was 20 but it’s something that has been on my mind recently. I had met this guy on tinder because I was interested in a casual hookup. At that time, I had just gotten out of a long-distance relationship with someone, so I felt exhausted. The first meet up was okay but when I initiated for more with the emphasis on casual, he told he would prefer dating and asked me if I would like to try it first. After thinking about it for a week or so, I decided to give it a shot because I respected his straightforwardness and liked his personality so we started to date but he didn't tell me he was bi-sexual until after a month or two. 

To be honest, I don’t have a problem with non-hetero relationships, it’s none of my business and I support the right to love who you love (within the laws of common-sense of course). Which is why I felt so hypocritical when I ended things. It’s not like that guy could choose who he likes, just like anyone else, but I still felt deeply uncomfortable being in a potential relationship with him. I just don’t see myself with someone who is gay because I am straight.  

It’s hard to write about this because if a guy finds out a girl is actually mtf and he doesn’t feel comfortable, from a Western perspective, it’s generally okay to leave because the distinction is clear from the expectation and reality. Whereas I feel that this is grayer area. Is it wrong to want someone who is only straight or is that inherently homophobic of me? 

In the end, the breakup ended okay, I wasn’t rude or bitter, I just explained I don’t feel comfortable. He did try to make things work but at that point I just felt that relationship wasn’t going anywhere, and I was already burned out from one relationship prior. I also think I rushed into that one too fast because of my loneliness when I was trying to avoid doing so in the first place when I was trying for a hookup. My judgement was really clouded. 

To add; I am not really insecure, I have a relatively healthy amount of self esteem and mental stability. I also didn't see his queerness as a something that he had to choose; either me or them type of spiel. I was even bi-curious at one point but realized that I 'm straighter than a ruler hah. If I am really honest with myself, If this happened again I think I would still decline. 

I haven't told anyone because at that point my friends were probably tired of hearing about the long-distance one so it's just something I kept to myself. But I want to know if this a wrong mentality to have, am I looking at this the wrong way?"	Asshole	0	0

She is bipolar, which is not her fault, but she has been on disability since her mid 20's for it. She refuses to stay on her meds and admits to lying to her psychiatrist and telling him what he wants to hear.

4 years ago when she was full blown manic. She checked herself into a psychiatric hospital. She left within 4 hours when she found out she couldn't have her cell phone and cigarettes. Her two teenage children that were still living with her were scared. So I went over there to try and talk to her and hopefully convince her to go sign herself in and get her meds sorted out.

When I got there she rambled for over an hour about how God has put her on this earth to change the way people see mental health. She then started talking shit about my husband, her own son. She talked about how he ruined her life and he was a horrible child and she is a saint for having not drowned him in the bathtub. I just tried to ignore her and keep focused on her getting help. Until she started talking about my son and how sorry she felt that he had to be raised by us in a ""Godless"" house. That he deserves better and regularly thinks about going to court to prove us unfit parents. I lost it, I said some horrible things about how she has treated her kids and left.

When my husband got home from work I told him everything, the continued abuse with his sister, what she said about him, me, and our son. He went over there, she screamed at him and when he told her, ""I've been holding so much in for years I've needed to say to you"" she said ""get the fuck out of my house you whiny little bitch"". So he left and that was that. She has never made an attempt to reconcile anything, has never apologized and uses her son disowning her as a way to get sympathy from everyone.

She continued to badmouth me on facebook. I almost wasn't hired for a job because of it. While she was \]manic she was messaging people and trying to cause problems. Two years ago she set her facebook to private so i couldn't see what she was saying about us.

Now, she is becoming manic again. So I created a fake facebook profile. I added some of her friends and built a whole lie of a life to make this look like a real person. She added me as a friend. I don't interact with her. I just read the stuff she posts. Am I the asshole for invading her privacy like this? Does it make me a shitty person that I created a fake profile and baited her into accepting a friend request?

TLDR: We are estranged from my mother in law, she likes to lie about me on facebook and has tried to ruin my relationships and even my job, so I created a fake facebook profile to stalk her and what she says and does online."		1	0
c66aiu	2019-06-27 14:37:34	Funguy0623	WIBTA if i got mad at my friend for not showing up to my birthday party?	"so for some background information, i have talked about this person before in [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bu6r89/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_she_needs_to_fix/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). TL;DR at the bottom.

lets just call the friend in question Jane

At the beginning of the month i started sending out invitations for my birthday party on the 22nd of June. Now i have been friends with Jane for almost 3 years and she lives on the street below me. So when i sent Jane the invitation i was expecting her to say that she could go. when i asked her she said ""maybe."" This is an understandable answer because graduation at our school was the day before on the 21st of June and if she had any relatives that graduated they would have a party on the 22nd because it is the weekend. As the day approaches i ask her again if she can go and she still doesn't give me an answer. Finally on the 21st she sends me a text saying that she cant go because one of her friends is having a graduation party on the 22nd . I accepted this and didn't send her the message i sent to everyone else clarifying the location and time.

Finally the 22nd approaches and the parts starts to get rolling as people start to arrive. One of our mutual friends arrives and we are just talking. She then asks where Jane is. I respond by saying that she had a graduation party to attend. The mutual friend responds by informing me that Jane DOESN'T have a graduation party, she just went shopping with one of her friends. This kind of annoyed me but i didn't want it to ruin the mood of the party so i just brush it off and keep going.the party started at 6 and at around 9:30 pm we decide we are going to walk to the park which means we are going to walk past Jane's house. As we are walking by her house she notices us decides to JOIN US in going to the park, either completely oblivious to whats going on or she is just ignoring the fact that this is the party that she said she wouldn't be able to attend because of the party. The party continued and we got kicked out of the park by the police for a noise complaint. After that everyone just went their separate ways.

Jane has a history of not going to important event and going shopping instead. The mutual friend i mentioned before was performing at a local coffee house a couple of months back and Jane ,who is a very good friend of hers, says that she is busy that day and cant go. later that day during the time of the performance, Jane posts on her Snapchat story showing that she is at the mall shopping.

So here is the big question i am trying to ask, WIBTA if i called/texted Jane and asked her why she didn't go?

TL;DR: I had a birthday party and one of my friends said she couldn't go. I found out she lied to me and then later joined the party uninvited and completely oblivious to what was going on. She has a history of not going to friend's important events and going shopping instead."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c66985	2019-06-27 14:34:32		WIBTA for refusing to pay someone money I morally owe them?	"Hello everyone, this situation is a lot more complicated than I can detail within character limit. So if I accidentally left anything out I'm happy to clear up any confusion! 

As a dumb 17 year old I illegally downloaded a movie and got caught. John and Linda (parental figures, not the only ones in my life) received a cease and desist letter asking for a fine just below 1k euros. I was told of this and got scolded. I heard that John consulted his lawyer and that was the last thing I was told. 

Since I was a minor and John owned our Internet, he legally was held responsible and had to deal with it. They never communicated to me about what was happening and guilt-riddled me wasn't keen on asking. After not hearing anything in the past three years (if not four), I thought it was done. 

Apparently not. Some stuff happened and I have strong reason to believe John will ask me to pay him back the money. I'm hesitant for mainly four reasons: 

1. Linda abused me since I was a little child. She gave me a lot of issues that I still carry with me today. John used something I said in explicit confidentiality against Linda in a fight (toxic people, infidelity) which was the final straw causing me to go NC for quite a while. I don't carry a lot of love for Linda and part of me wants to just say ""fuck you"". 

2. I received some information that the case got escalated to court. This means John acted either wrongly or riskily. Court escalation includes penalties, lawyer fees, etc. I had no control over how he handled the case so I don't want to pay possibly triple (or more) the inital amount. 

3. It feels unfair of them to jump this on me now after not saying a word of this in 3/4 years. In my opinion they should have asked me back then to pay them the money (even if at a later time) or at *least* given me some indication that this was still an unsolved issue. Like do they still get to hold this over my head in 15 years if it isn't resolved soon? 

4. It comes at an extremely inopportune time. I already had to drop my last job because of my insane work load at university. I currently have no social life and barely time for self-care. Not only would me being forced to pay this back mean a definitive drop in grades and health but also a complete destruction of what's left of my personal life (not kidding I'm walking the tight rope of mental health and finances right now - only temporary, but at least for another year). Feels unfair that consequences can be so severe right now when at other points in my life they would have meant a little less gaming time for me. 

I'm not completely ready to say no though since John did enable me to get my HS education and I do morally subscribe to ""do the crime, pay the fine"". Just feels wrong that paying the fine at a random point in my life could literally cause me to lose scholarships. I am not legally forced to do anything, so WIBTA if I refused?"	Asshole	1	0

c668bg	2019-06-27 14:32:30	GreyAsh	AITA for confronting a kid who jumped at my car?	"This happened a long time ago, I didn't think that I was an asshole at the time but I could have been wrong.

I live near a park not huge, maybe half the size of a football field. The park is surrounded by a gate with two entrances/exits, one on each side. I was heading to a movie theater near the park with a friend and as we passed I noticed a group of 7-8 kids ages 13-15 walking down the road. I pulled to the opposite side of the road since there was space and it's not a huge deal to me to drive around them. One of 14 year old's nearest my car waited until I was close and suddenly jumped at us with his arms out. I wouldn't have hit him because cruising slow, but I did slam on my brakes since it was sudden enough that I didn't know if he was going to keep going. The kids started to laugh so I rolled down my window. This caused them to bolt into the park through the gate nearby in an attempt to cut to the other side. Like I said, it's about the size of half a football field, so it's not a quick sprint.

Quick aside, when I was around the same age I threw a snowball at the side of a truck as it passed and the driver stopped and asked me what I was doing and told me how dangerous it was to pull a stupid move like that. Well I never did that again. So when they ran, I did what the driver did. I reversed the car, and drove around to the other side of the park where the gate lets out. The kids noticed I turned around and doubled back towards the first gate, so I did the same. When they realized that they couldn't just flee the kid who jumped at my car actually walked over. He asked if I thought that he meant to jump at my car and explained that I misunderstood and he was just joking around with his friends. His friends were around 5-10 feet behind him just watching. I stayed in my car and let him know that I knew he wasn't joking, that if I had to guess he was trying to look cool in front of his friends, and that the last thing he expected was for the driver he was messing with to stop. He initially began to disagree but then apologized and said that he didn't mean for it to be such a big deal. I let him know that it wasn't, but not everyone who he jumps at is going to be paying attention and that could lead to him or them getting hurt. The kid understood and we parted with me telling him to be safe and him and his friends heading into the park.

I didn't mean to parent him and I wasn't trying to embarrass him, but I also didn't feel bad about anything I said. My friend was silent and when I asked her if she thought it would actually have any impact or if he was just bs'ing she snapped that I didn't have to be such an asshole and they were just kids, I humiliated him for no reason. I explained the story of the snowball truck driver and she told me that he was an asshole too. The movie was good.

A while back, my mom told me that my dad was thinking about taking me to see my grandparents (dad's parents) I haven't seen for over 5 years. My mom also told me that my dad and I would go alone which really scared me. 

It's not like I don't like my dad or he's abusive, it's just that I really depend on my mom for things like my mental health so being away from her is really hard. I told my mom I didn't want to go if she wouldn't be there, to which she basically told me I might not have a choice.

Last time I saw my dad's side of the family (they came over to our house), we all went out together but my mom got sick so she couldn't go. I broke down when she told me she couldn't go, when in reality, it was only 2 hours without seeing her. 

The main reason why I don't want to go is my anxiety, I get really really anxious whenever talking to strangers or people I haven't seen for a really long time. I'm afraid that I might start crying whenever I have to speak to my grandparents and that'll make everyone worry. 

Another reason is that my dad's side of the family is really sketchy and ghetto. This is kinda mean to say, but I really don't like them. My grandfather is pretty racist and that rubs me the wrong way.

If my dad decides he does want to go, I don't want to make him upset by saying I don't want to go with him. But I also feel it's best for my mental health to stay home with my mother. 

So, would I be the asshole?"		1	0

She had this one snow globe with a bear inside that you can rotate the bottom and then it plays Beethoven's "" Für Elise"".

Now one day I was cleaning the apartment so I cleaned all of the snow globes, by the end of day I stayed up watching a movie until 2 am. Then out of nowhere the snow globe starts playing that song and it freaked me out. Happened again a few days later with my sister.

&#x200B;

Now I am in engineering school and I don't believe in that possession crap, I fully believe that it was just stored energy from moving it around since in both scenarios we were cleaning the house.

&#x200B;

My sister fully believes in demons and ghosts, so she asked me to get rid of it.

Here is the catch, I had a trip to Goodwill to donate clothes, so I sorta took it with me, dropped it off there, now I'm worried it's freaking some lady out at home.

"So my mom and I [25M] both have an app called “Find my Friends” on our iPhones which you can use to show your location to other people. I agreed to share this with her since I thought it would be for emergencies only. 

Lately though, she’s been making comments on my location that make me really uncomfortable. Like the other day I went to a city I wouldn’t normally go to after work and she asked me about that on the phone. I’m on vacation right now and today on a call she commented on how I must have had a good night’s sleep because I was in my hotel room for a long time. Again this creeped me out.

She means well and doesn’t realize this makes me uncomfortable. I also still live with her so I’m not totally independent yet. She’s also sensitive and would likely take it the wrong way if I told her I wasn’t comfortable with this.

So WIBTA if I told her to stop?

c662di	2019-06-27 14:17:55	one2manny	WIBTA for not supporting SO taking out more student debt	"New account. Been dating my SO for 7 years (since undergraduate).

Background: I have recently graduated with my terminal degree and started a job making roughly $150,000. Throughout my years of schooling I never chose the best school I got into or a dream school in order to keep my debt down.

My SO took out 6 figures of undergraduate debt and has only been able to make minimum payments due to job outlooks in her degree so is still in 6 figure debt. As we get closer to looking at marriage I have always been fine with accepting that her debt would become mine and that her career choice will make very little money so I will have to shoulder most of it. This has never been a problem, but now she is looking into her masters and PHD in the same field and refuses to look into any school that's not her dream school.

Now for the problem. With my new salary she has made comments about how it wouldn't be easy but we could pay of a 300k loan for those two degrees and that its unfair that I got to spend the time in school getting the final degree I wanted while she never did. Even with a PHD her career field is limited and I have tried my hardest to find programs and research positions so that she can get her education paid for without debt. She has not been interested in these routes as she is only interested in going to a ""top school"" such as Berkeley.

c6621h	2019-06-27 14:17:08	cuztrouble2	AITA for telling my cousin that what she did was shitty?	"There is a LOT of backstory here that I won't get into, mostly involving all of the other similar shitty things of this nature that my cousin has done in the last 3 or 4 years.  I just want to know if in this particular instance, I was being a jerk.

So my cousin, let's call her Jen, has been living with her boyfriend for about a year. For just about this whole time she's been cheating on him with one of his friends. She also is currently unemployed and even when she was working did not pay rent or bills, her boyfriend pays for everything. At our best, Jen and I are really close even though I get very annoyed with her choices. She constantly turns to me for advice so I am not meddling, she asks. She's 31, so not like, a confused college kid just trying to navigate adulthood. 

Anyway, Jen texts me saying she is going to break up with her boyfriend for good (mostly because she wants to be with his friend) but she wants to wait until AFTER HE TAKES HER TO THE ROLLING STONES. So seeing as her boyfriend is a little crazy, my concern is that this will only anger him further when she dumps him. Rightfully so. She tells me yea, you're probably right but I don't want him to go alone, he'll be sad. I say, I'm pretty sure he can find someone to go with him without problem.

The next day, of course she goes to the concert. 

So I text her and say: I see you made your choice. So how long are you gonna wait to break up with him now?

Jen: Hopefully not long.

Me: That was a shitty thing to do.

Jen: Idk I thought about it and I decided it was the right thing to do (BISH REALLY?????)

She goes on to say: But he is controlling right? (This was one of the reasons she says she is going to break up with him)

This is when I say: Honestly the controlling part is just as much your fault as his because being financially dependent on him gives him that. And he knows he can take you places and give you money to keep you around. That's why financial independence is so important.

This is what sends Jen into a rage. She says she's very offended and if I want to ""discuss how all I am is a gold digging whore I guess we'll just have to wait a little while"". And she hasn't talked to me since.

I got out of bed, walked over to the light switch, and turned the light on. Normally I tell my SO before I turn the light on because they get migraines with sudden light sometimes, but SO was sleep. The light stayed on for about 5 minutes while SO slept as I got my clothes together. SO then wakes up, scolding me about not telling them I was going to turn on the light. 

I told SO that they were sleep, and didn't know whether I should have woke them up to tell them I was turning the light on. Then I asked directly if SO wants me to wake them up to warn them about the light, rather than letting them sleep. SO cut me off mid question and started saying that I don't need to explain myself and that I was wrong. I reiterated that I wasn't trying to explain, but rather ask directly to make sure I do what is best in the future, but I get cut off that time again with the answer yes and that I need to stop repeating myself. 

At this point I feel disrespected for being repeatedly cut off, whether this matter is big or small, so my tone goes a little negative (clear that this is rubbing me the wrong way, but not yelling). I explain that I only repeated myself because SO didn't answer the question at first, cut me off, and was thinking I was trying to explain myself when I was just trying to get an answer. SO says that they aren't willing to hear me if I am going to talk to them with a ""jacked up attitude"" and asks for me to stop talking to them.

c65z3c	2019-06-27 14:09:56	KidPowered17	AITA? She’s not invited to the party	"Backstory:

I have known T since college in the early 2000s, and we have been friends ever since. He recently moved to my current city and then into my building about two years ago, and we hang out 4-5 times a week. About ten months ago, he started dating S, who was awful to my girlfriend and has also been rude to me on a couple of occasions. It’s well-known that we don’t like each other, and are somewhat cordial only because T is there. 

In early August, my city throws a huge block party where everyone dresses in white and comes out to support the local business district. It ends up being a giant street festival for the better part of the day, and thousands of people in the city come out to enjoy it. I am fortunate enough to lease an office space less than a block away from the area with free parking, a panoramic view of downtown and access to the space after hours to throw a private party for friends and family (about 40-50 people). This is an annual event for my office, and has gotten to the point that it is probably going to be invite only to prevent overcrowding. 

AITA for telling T that she is not invited to my party? They aren’t in a committed relationship, and he swears that this is nothing serious with her and will probably go nowhere. Her attitude sucks and I don’t want her to ruin the overall mood of the festivities."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I don't really like gifts. I'd rather you spend time with me than buy me something. But I do keep a collection of Father's Day cards so far in my desk. I don't throw away cards even though the card I got my wife was long gone by now.

Father's Day came and went and I didn't get a card, or anything. Not even a verbal ""Happy Father's Day"" from my wife. She knows I don't like gifts but this went a little further than that. The day after Father's Day I asked her why she didn't do anything at all and she shrugged. She got a little upset that I brought it up as now she felt bad. I dropped it.

Two days ago I went to a stationery store and asked if they had any FD cards left and bought one. I brought it home, got my kids handprints inked on it, and put it away. I guess my little one told my wife she handprinted my Father's Day card and my wife is furious, saying I couldn't let it go and I had to go behind her back, etc etc etc. She made me throw it away.

Was I the asshole? Even my own mother said it was devious what I did and I'm just floored. Wife is still not talking to me and I feel like I have to admit I was wrong to get out of this. All I wanted was a card and it turned into this huge mess."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c65x1h	2019-06-27 14:05:10	Whoopsieacct	"AITA for telling my BIL and his husband their financial situation is dire and refusing to ""help"" them?"	"I'll try and make this short, but this one has me reeling.


My brother-in-law and his husband have lived a pretty good life for a long time. I'd long suspected that their income was much higher than they had indicated, because many of their purchases didn't make sense. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Their income was *lower* than they hinted, and their debt load is now massive.


How I found out:


My wife was talking to her brother about the new budgeting software we switched to (specifically, to highlight how nerdy I am. I was excited about it.) Somehow it came up that they were looking for a debt consolidation loan to save some money on interest. She said they should ask me about it, as I have worked in companies that did those kind of loans.


They approached me about it after I got home from work and I started asking pretty normal questions: How much are you consolidating? Where is it from? How much are your current minimums? What other debts do you have? What are your income levels? Etc. 


They're all questions underwriters would need answered, and I wanted a good picture of what was happening before I gave them information. One of the things I've learned is that credit card consolidation loans are almost never used correctly, and red flags were waving in my head when they asked about those loans. 


Final tally came to ~190k in debt without considering the mortgage. They make 80k combined. They have ~$2000 in a checking account currently and nothing in savings or 401k. Their cars are worth about 30k and they have about 30k in equity in their home. They are both in their 40s. 

I told them I couldn't help them, and that giving them any path to new available credit (you take out a new loan to consolidate debt, which means that the credit cards would be open again) before they make serious strides to fixing the situation they've put themselves in (they're still spending) would be like me helping them set the noose around their neck. 

They got upset and left, and we got calls/Facebook messages from the rest of the family accusing me of ""prying"" into their financial life, and a few accusing me of being homophobic (I used the word ""lifestyle,"" which I should have recognized as a dogwhistle for their sexuality, but I was referring to their spending) which all really hurt. My wife is upset and doesn't know who to believe (she was not in the room for most of this). My MIL called my wife and said that (among other things) I should have just given them some recommendations and left it at that. 

I'm stuck because I agree. If I had just given them names and left it, everything would be fine. However, I don't think I was being an asshole. I don't like giving half-answers around finances, but they also hadn't really asked for advice, just recommendations. So maybe kind of an asshole?

So, AITA? I don't think they let the rest of the family know about their situation, and I have thus far resisted the urge to fill all of the family in because I think I'd definitely be the asshole then.


**Edit:** there are a lot of comments, so I figured I'd add a few things I noticed.

The first is the source of their debt. It's mostly student loans, followed by two (very) nice cars (these were actually the purchases that didn't make sense to me), followed by a lot of credit card debt. They had a higher income for a few years, as BIL's husband works in sales and had a run of several good years. I think a lot of the CC debt came from not being able to re-adjust to a more modest lifestyle. The student loans were undertaken to get a Master's degree. 

Second, my BIL has not accused me of homophobia directly. It was my SIL, through a vague Facebook message that was very clearly directed at me. 

Third, my wife is defending me, but thinks I must have said something or done something unintentionally to cause this. It's not that she doesn't trust me, she just knows that I'm sometimes overly blunt when talking about financial matters. 

Fourth, I think they were uncomfortable with my line of questioning from the start, but I can be somewhat intense when I get going. I don't know if they felt pressured into answering my questions and regretted telling me. They didn't explicitly ask for advice, just for a general explanation of loan consolidation and what would be best. 

Finally, I'm at work for another few hours, but I'm planning to drop by their house with some beer and apologize. Hopefully we can mend fences. I didn't want to hurt their feelings or scare them, but they're truly one of the worst financial cases I've seen in my career."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I am visiting my parents for a holiday at the moment. Their flat has three bedrooms: parent's bedroom with a double bed, children's bedroom with two single beds and a guest room with a single bed. Currently I am sleeping with my brother in room A whilst my father is sleeping in his room. My sister (24) is coming for a visit with her boyfriend as well in the next few days and this is where my dilemma arises.

Just before leaving, my mother told me that when my sister arrives, my brother will go sleep to the parent's bedroom, my sister's bf and I will take the children's room and she will go to sleep alone to the guest room. I suggested that I would gladly go sleep alone so my sister and her bf can stay in the same room, but my mother insisted we did it her way. In my head, this is an insane attempt to control a 24 year old girl (she has insane control issues overall); I would myself be extremely angry if she tried to that with me and my partner.

"Basically there was this business trip a friend would have to go on and he needed some unskilled labor and wanted some company. Myself being unemployed and having no other commitments, I thought I'd join him, get some money out of it (not from him, but the organizer of the event he was attending), and see a different city etc. We'd be going halfsies on everything. Keep in mind I got paid about 150$ which barely covered the flights, while he got 8-9 times that with a paid flight. Essentially I thought of it as a cheap trip opportunity.

&#x200B;

The issue is that we had to rent a car from there. I checked online and the price was about 100$ for the days we needed it, from various companies. Now, my friend said he knew a guy which will make a good deal and I needn't worry about it. After the trip is over and we're back at home he gets sent the invoice, which is about 350$. Half of it is more than the entire cost from some random internet company. He says he didn't know, but also when I asked 3-4 times about how much the car is gonna cost before the trip, his reply was ""don't worry about it, I'm sure it won't be something crazy"". I couldn't check the price for myself as I didn't even know the guy's company name or smth.

Edit: the car is not paid for and he will not be reimbursed because it wasn't needed for the business, we mainly used it to travel around abit on our free time

Edit2: it's not about his integrity as a character. I know he genuinely didn't bother asking how much it would've cost, for whatever reason, and the price is correct, I've seen the invoice. The price difference came from a different insurance policy, which was basically unnecessary. I think that his friend's price for that type of insurance was actually quite fair compared to the market price.

c65t3p	2019-06-27 13:55:13	Flammabubble	AITA for wanting a refund from an eBay seller?	"I purchased some football socks from Ebay to finish off the kit I had bought. They are official Adidas socks and arrived as new in packaging as described and looked great.

The week I received them I wore them twice to play football, and after the second game I noticed that one sock had a big hole in the sole. I hadn't worn them any differently to usual socks, and I hadn't been walking in them without shoes on so I was a little annoyed as I had expected they would last longer than two games.

As they had broken so quickly, I messaged the seller with a photograph and asked if he would provide a replacement or refund as they had broken so quickly. While he's obviously not the manufacturer, in my experience on ebay as a seller, the seller assumes responsibility for items in the same way that a store would and I presumed the pair he had sent me were simply defective.

The seller has since been very difficult and is refusing the request because the product has been used and it must have been misuse that caused the issue which is nothing to do with him. Part of his argument is how would he return them to a manufacturer when they have been worn.

"A little back story on my ex, we were ""together"" for 7ish years. She was a manipulative narcissistic sociopath. I don't want to delve into all of that right now, other than explaining she made what were supposed to be the happiest years of my life a living hell.

I finally got out, and I've known my current girlfriend before. We started dating two years ago, had a child, blah blah. There have been times my ex has tried to meddle, God forbid I try to be happy right?

First) My girlfriend has always known my ex's step sister, she's younger and was good friends with my girlfriend's ex-step daughter. But now she's been trying to get closer. Schedule play dates with our toddlers, and have lunches together.

Second) We actually found out last year that my ex's half brother lives down the road from us with his mother. Recently, my girlfriend has drummed up a friendship with the mother. 

Third) I've recently discovered that my current girlfriend is following some of my ex's better friends on social media. For what reason? It wasn't explained to me when I asked.

Two things that make me think it's not all bad are the facts that my ex has told everyone she knows that I physically abused her, which isn't true. My girlfriend gets to set that record straight. Second is the fact that my girlfriend has a bit of social anxiety and doesn't make friends easily. 

So am I the asshole for being upset she's making friends with those people?

Also a side note, my girlfriend is also having dinner and trying to make a friendship with someone I was previously kinda/sorta in love with for a while. She was a good friend of mine, but I respected the relationship she was in at the time and never tried to make her uncomfortable with how I felt. We drifted apart because, well, you can probably guess that my ex drove a wedge between us after we started dating.

Edit: I should add it's not a small town by any means. Also, I've changed some words that I didn't catch were changed by autocorrect.

Edit2: I've never told her what she can and can't do. I've asked to not hear if they talk about my ex. But then afterward, all I hear is about what they talked about her."	Asshole	0	0

I’m not sure if it’s weird or not to take scissors to his wife’s wedding dress so AITA if I do?



Edit 1: my boyfriend was the one who offered the dress to me to repurpose. I didn’t specifically ask for it

Edit 2: the wedding dress in question isn’t owned by the wife. She left it with my boyfriend 

I really just love the idea of giving new meaning to old things to give them a new life and carry on a story

Edit 3: I will obviously now (or not so obviously) ask the wife or get my boyfriend to ask before I do anything if I do anything. I don’t really know her, never met her or spoken to her

The thing is that I just started learning how to use FL Studio, and I'm not advanced enough to do a soundtrack for a game.

Also, I am a bit advanced with art, but I only draw something now and then, supplying a whole game with sprites, world design and everything is too much of a challenge for me. 

I tried making a main theme, but I just cannot make a whole song, I did the beat, and a lead synth, but things are too difficult after that.

I just tried making a character today, and it looks very amateur-ish.

Last week he asked me if I wanted to help him, and I accepted, because I thought things would be less difficult.

Edit: I only expect YTA and NAH answers, since he is not the asshole in any way, he just wants to do something, and asked me for help, since he knows I do things like that in my free time."	No A-holes here	0	0
c65ru7	2019-06-27 13:51:56	AITthrowaway_	AITA for wanting to put our dog down?	"My wife and I have a dog, which was her dog before we got together. He is an 11-year-old German Shepherd. Over the last few years he has started to have accidents (poop) on the carpet more and more frequently. Recently it seems that we come home to poop on the carpet at least every other week.

&#x200B;

He's a big dog. He takes big dumps. They are runny and smell horrible and get everywhere. We've tried changing his diet, had him to the vet to inquire about illnesses, etc. to no avail.

&#x200B;

We love the dog, but this is becoming too much. We are very clean people otherwise. Our house is always clean. It always smells nice. We take pride in our home. So, naturally, having to spend hours cleaning up massive, runny dog shits three times a month is getting to be too much. In addition to the bowel problems, he's having issues with arthritis in his hips (common to GSD breed) and has some trouble getting around. This doesn't come into play with the bowel issues though, I don't think, because he always chooses to go down the stairs to the basement to do his business. He is let out in the morning before we leave, as soon as we get home, and multiple times throughout the evening. We have a large yard that he is able to spend lots of time in. Still, he poops on the carpet.

&#x200B;

I want to put him down. I love him, but I can't keep letting this happen to the house. I can't spend so many hours cleaning up his runny shit. With that, along with his hip problems and general age, I just think it's time. My wife thinks I'm a complete asshole for even thinking about it.

Turns out, she told me that the guy is 30 years old and is divorced. She told me that she hooked up with him.

I became worried about her, because she just turned 18 not long ago, and the man is more than 10 years older and is okay with this sort of relationship with someone that's barely legal.

I tried to talk to her about the consequences and explaining to her that it might be dangerous to see someone like that, and that she should maybe stick to someone closer in age but she just brushed me off and ignored me, telling me it's ""none of my business"".

Since I couldn't get to her, I figured that telling our mom about it would work better, since I'm worried about her as her older brother.

Our mom flipped out and grounded her (she still lives at home) for the entire summer break and checked on her phone to see if there was any sketchy people hitting her up.

c65kqq	2019-06-27 13:33:19	unknownmagicbeans	WIBTA Taking a neglected cat	"Background information:
Live 3 doors down from a neighbor. Neighbor has 3 cats, 2 that are cared for well and 1 neglected. The cat is forced to stay out in the rain/snow/cold all night as it doesn't get along with one of the owner's newer cats.

Due to this the cat is dying for companionship; it's lost a large part of care from its life. The only time the cat is acknowledged is the occasional feeding and when the owner's grandaughter plays with it. The playing is short lived as, while old enough to know the error of her ways, shes very aggressive (even issues I've had with them non-cat related) with it, to the point the cat rarely wants to be near her. 

Around my first time witnessing the cat I genuinely believed it to be stray as it was timid of me at first and never seen an owner call it. Very skinny, matted fur and cuts from fighting (with what I now know are the other cats). I took the cat into my home for a night. She absolutely loved it and so did I. 

A few weeks pass of me letting this 'stray' cat stay sporadically. My last cat had just passed away so I think we both appreciated the company. Anyway, the neighbor knocks on my door after a few weeks and asks I stop feeding her cat as she won't come home. I apologize whole-heartedly as I can't imagine what it would be like to lose a family member like that and agree to stop. 

The current:
Since the agreement to stop letting the cat in my home (October 2018) the cat is still not looked after. In November she came to me sickly thin and was crying for food constantly. I had to give her some, not out of spite to the owner, but out of genuine guilt that if I didn't she would starve. I also went and bought supplies and created her an insulated waterproof box (Large plastic storage container lined with multiple layers of cardboard, blankets, bubble wrap, etc.) In fear that she wouldn't survive the winter. The cat is still outside and whilst I've seen it approach the grandaughter once since the beginning of all this, it proceeded to quickly run away. The cat is always choosing to sleep in my garden. I never hear the owner shout for her even in the rain and snow. 

I'm moving into a new house next week and wanted to take the cat. It's illegal, someone else's family member and has some history here. I just genuinely can't sleep some nights knowing she's outside my house in a tiny box in the cold. It's a selfish reason as it's curing my worrying but I would really like to give her an actual home and life; it seems she wants nothing more than this as she's constantly trying to come in my house still and purrs just on sight of me.

WIBTA if I take the cat? I feel guilty and sorrowful daily thinking about this cat but at the same time, feel awful about contemplating taking someone else's  family member regardless of its state of care. I appreciate the time you've took to read this."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c65knv	2019-06-27 13:33:09		AITA for demanding my friend be a witness ?	"TW SEXUAL ASSUALT 

&#x200B;

So about 18 months ago my (f 22) roommate, Stacey (f22), had some people over, including her brother and his friends. There were about 5 people in our house having some drinks and most of them were pretty drunk. I was not part of this group and was out with my other roommate having some cocktails etc at a local bar. I arrive home with other roommate at around 11pm and we both go to bed. I fall asleep at around 12,30. We leave the group to drink downstairs. Most of the group headed home shortly after including Stacey's brother, but one of her friends stays behind. He is called Dave. (18 m) 

&#x200B;

Dave is vey drunk attempts to kiss Stacey, but she doesn't welcome his advances and tells him to back off, there is another female friend in the room when this happens. Both Stacey and her female friend go to sleep in her room leaving Dave to sleep on the sofa. 

&#x200B;

Dave then creeps upstairs into my room and climbs into my bed, he sexually molests me and kisses me while I sleep. I wake up to him on top of me and him penetrating me with his fingers. I wake up and lock my self in the bathroom and call 911. This was around 1.15am. This whole scenario has left me really anxious and I have lost so much sleep. 

&#x200B;

This has all led to a criminal trial which is due to start soon, however Stacey is refusing to attend as a witness as she says she is nervous. She says she sees no point in coming as her female friend is and will say all the same things anyway. My other room mate is attending as she  witnessed the aftermath and me crying right after etc etc

c65f05	2019-06-27 13:17:57	trowytrow8000	AITA for spending time with my boyfriend?	" 

I have been single for 6 years since my last and only relationship, gay guy here btw. I made many changes in my life and left my country to study, phd student now. Dating in a different country was HARD but I finally met a great local guy. He lives in a city next to mine, he works a lot, so we can only meet on weekends. He is super sweet, doesn't speak English nor my mother tongue so we talk in his language and we do our best to overcome cultural differences.

One of my female friends is very vocal about me meeting with my bf every weekend. She is great, but, and this is not only my opinion, she can be super pushy. She works now so she is  busy. Before having my bf we hanged out when possible, normally at a Friday night or during the weekend. Sometimes she would have plans. 

Me and my boyfriend have invited her sometimes to hang out, but not always as he drives me out of town to visit other places. So, we mostly spend the weekend together.

Some people are very fast to judge that is not ok for me to schedule my weekend around my boyfriend. But we can only see each other on weekends, and sometimes he can’t come on Saturday, so we only hang out for a few hours on Sunday. He makes my happy, and I’m trying to build a relationship with someone that doesn’t share my language or culture, it is a challenge, but we are doing pretty great so far.

Lately, my friend would send me messages on a weekday and be like “let’s do something this weekend”. And I would be like “let me check BF schedule to see when I’m meeting him” or “Sorry, we are leaving town, we are going to \[Place\]”. She knows that I spend my weekends with him, and she doesn’t even ask me for Friday, a  day that was totally ok before. The other problem is that she immediately would make a remark like “Dude, is not ok for you to plan your weekend around him.” Again: we have hang out with her before. Any other of my friends are like “Oh, enjoy the weekend, take pics”. She is the only one that makes this kind of remarks.

2 weeks ago she asked me if I was available, I said that BF wasn’t coming on Saturday so I was free. Her answer? “I have plans, let’s meet on Sunday”. And I was like “Sunday I meet with BF”. I asked BF if it was ok for her to tag along. He said yes. She said no to our invitation because it was too early in the morning. 

She had these plans on Saturday but never bothered to ask me if I wanted to go, she went with other friends.This week, she tried again, I said I wasn’t sure about my schedule with BF. She said “Hang out with me, he can join us if he has time”. Which I found rude, because he has to drive all the way here, or I must take a train to meet him halfway.

I’m starting to seeing her as a demanding, bossy and egoist girl that doesn’t understand that it took me 6 years to finally be in a serious, healthy and very sweet adult relationship. All my friends but her get this."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c65dk3	2019-06-27 13:14:08	throwawaylsjyjja	AITA for telling my friend that it's OK if she doesn't have time?	"My (21) friend (21) recently moved into a new city, about two or three months ago, but still comes home at least once a week. 
I've been really busy with work for uni recently but I still try to make time for her as often as I can, considering that I can't stay at her new flat super late each day without sleeping over, as I have to catch my train in time and like I already said I've been pretty busy the last few weeks. 
My friend is pretty attached? I guess and is a person who doesn't like to be alone and I am more of an introvert. I still try to consider her feelings and ask if she has time to hang out, just this week I asked her two times but she was busy with something else each time or hanging out with someone else. No big deal right? We'll just find another time that works for both of us. I am generally a person who is very forgiving, so I often say (after I asked someone to hang out/ for a favour/ etc etc.) that it would be nice if something works out but it's OK too if it doesn't as I don't want people to feel pressured into something. 

Well, today my friend asked me if I wanted to come over after uni and I had to decline, but I offered to come by tomorrow. There was a problem with our schedules again because when I am done with classes for the day, she starts. She then said that she would come to her parent's home tomorrow evening and we could hang out around here. I said ""Okay sure, *but you don't have to go all the way only because of me.*""
She took this very wrong apperently and then called me crying while I was on my way home and said to me that she has the feeling that I don't want to spend time with her, that she's lonely when she's alone in her flat, that I'm avoiding her...
I explained that I say this sort of stuff to everyone and not exclusively to her and that I don't mean any harm by it. Like I already said I do this because I don't want people to be pressured by me or to make them feel like they HAVE to do something. I also said to her that this doesn't have anything to do with me avoiding her, that I like spending time with her (if I was avoiding her I wouldn't have asked her to hang out multiple times) and that I didn't know that she would take this to heart this much. I also sent her a text but she hasn't replied yet.

I told them that I'm in, however I've chanced my mind about it in the meantime. 

First of all, this ""vacation"" would probably not feel like one, it'd  be more of an alcohol fueled getaway for 7 days in which the goal is to destroy your liver. I have no problem with drinking, but 1 day or maybe 2 is all I'd partake in, because after that I just feel like a walking corpse. In addition to that, this little trip  is exactly after I'd return from a 1 month of working in a different location than my home, so I'd already be exhausted as hell.

Second, I feel like I'm a bit too tired of this type of escapade. I've been having these types of trips for about 4/5 years in a row, ever since I was 15 so I feel like I've done and seen pretty much everything there is to be done/seen. I'm more interested in a ""just sunbathe with a cold beer in your hand for 8 hours a day at an all inclusive resort then sleep"" type of thing, which is 101% NOT what my friends have in mind.

Barely any planning has been done, no tickets bought and no accommodation booked, so I wouldn't screw them over financially, but I'm sure they'd get extremely mad at me because I already agreed to go on vacation together.

I've known this friend for about 2 years now, he's always been a bit full on (due to minor Autism) but he kind of started hanging around me and I grew to like him as we shared some interests. Recently he moved away for university but we remained in contact through platforms like steam and discord for a month or two before he stopped talking to me. My other friends never liked him because he was a compulsive yes man who agreed with the room and kind of creepy to our female friends but I mainly chalked it down to his mental state and it was never serious, just awkward unrequited flirting.

"I work at a library, when a woman came in with her daughter. At first, when the two were in the designated children's area, it was fine that the child was having fun and making noise, as it wasn't bothering anyone. However, when she brought her child into the main part of the library where it is generally quieter, the woman continued to play with her child in the same manner, making enough noise to disrupt other customers. 

I thought to myself that she should either quieten down or go back into the children's area where they were free to make noise. But then I got busy doing something else and forgot about it. A couple of minutes later, an elderly man reading a newspaper spoke up to the woman. I had no idea what he said, but he ended up leaving in a mood.

The woman then came up to the counter with her child and told me that the man told her to 'get lost' at the end of their argument. Rather than apologize and end the issue (which I probably should have done), I explained that there is a designated children's area, where there is plenty of space to run around and make noise. Then she said she doesn't understand my viewpoint and that children should be encouraged to come into libraries and restructuring them to one area won't do that.

c658zc	2019-06-27 13:02:10	kindakeen	AITA for hating my partner's tattoos?	"My SO has some tattoos which she got when she was younger. I really don't like how a lot of them look, especially one on her wrist and one on her inner arm between her elbow and armpit. I have a stupid tattoo myself, but it is on my back and no one can see it. It's not something I think about daily, as with time I have become blind to them. But anytime it's summer or we are on the beach, I can see people looking at them. My girl is a great person but I feel like people often judge her based on these visible tattoos (me included, I guess). They are nothing gruesome, wrist is a date which is unnecessarily bolded and the arm one is a corny Latin saying about fate (the embodiment of teenage tattoos which you thought were a good idea that one week 10 years ago). I don't think having tattoos per se is bad, having corny ones is the issue. I have mentioned this to her carefully and she says she kinda hates them too and will look into removing them, but I doubt that will make them go away 100% and will possibly only make it worse. So, AITA?

Edit: The beach was a bad example, as obviously mine is just as noticeable as hers when naked. I was trying to say hers are visible with, say, a short sleeve on, while mine isn’t (hence the “not as bad” attitude towards mine). Also I am 100% sure our brief conversation about them was nothing offensive, as I know saying something like “I hate your tattoos get rid of them” in an inconsiderate way would not fly with her all and would be a huge issue, which it was not. 
I am not sure that having these thoughts and feelings definitely makes me a shallow person, but I do agree it’s a shallow thing to do- make an issue out of this. Like I said, this has never materialised into a “thing.” I wrote this post to have the chance to consciously think and evaluate why this even comes up in my head and get an objective opinion without dumping this on my SO. All the comments have helped, for which I thank you. Who knows, if this ever comes up again we can try removing them and pretend we were never dumb, impulsive teenagers.

My girlfriend and I were at our friends' apartment last night watching some TV and drinking, just hanging out having fun. For context, our friends recently adopted a puppy that's roughly 6 months old. He has A TON of energy and loves to jump on people and just wont ever sit still, normal puppy stuff. As we were getting ready to leave my girlfriend realized she couldn't find one of her shoes. Come to find out the dog had gotten a hold of it and essentially destroyed the shoes. She was visibly upset because she just got them a few days ago from her work at \*high end women's retail store.\* She gets a discount there and only spent $40 dollars, where the retail on them is somewhere in the mid to low hundreds. When our friends realized what happened they apologized and said ""yeah he's chewed up a few of our shoes."" But then that was basically it.

On our way home my girlfriend was about in tears over it because of how it was handled. She's upset because they knew he has chewed up shoes before but didn't bother to tell us ""hey maybe put your shoes in a spot the dog can't reach."" Since we've known the dog he has never had any issues with chewing up other people's stuff either. She wants to make a big stink about it and ask them to at least give some sort of money so she can get a new pair to replace these ones. I told her not to make a huge fuss because this couple has been our best friends for a handful of years and I don't want to make things tense with them.

So this begs the question; would I (or my girlfriend) be the asshole for asking for some money to replace the shoes?"		1	0
c656bt	2019-06-27 12:54:39	PositivePossibility	AITA for being pissed at my dad although I damaged his most valued possession, but it wasn't my fault?	"Tl;dr at the end

Alright, here's the issue. 

My dad bought himself a triumph motorcycle a couple years ago and it's his most valued possession. We're not that rich, so it's one of the most expensive things he's splurged on and he's taken good care of it every single day. 


I've recently turned 18 and learnt how to ride a motorcycle on a smaller bike, and slowly transitioned to using this huge, heavy monstrosity for errands nearby. I'm not allowed to take it very far yet, because it weighs about 4 times as much as I do and controlling it in high traffic takes experience.

Now here's the issue. About 2 weeks ago, while parking the bike, I fell down and screwed up the clutch and gear of the bike. Luckily, the repair wasn't expensive at all and since it was my first fall, he let it slide and asked me to be more careful next time. 

Now we move to today. He asked me to take the bike and go buy a couple things for him from 2 different stores. One store is the farthest he's ever let me take the bike, and one's pretty close to our house. I went and got the farther one done without a hitch. As for the second store, I parked the bike on a slight incline and went in. When I came out, I wore my helmet, put on my bag, and started the bike. Unfortunately, while I was inside, some dumbass played with the bike and pulled the choke and messed with the gears. The bike suddenly pulled and I ended up falling on my right. 

Now, I pushed the choke back in, and everything was fine and dandy. The thing is, my leg is fucked thanks to a hot exhaust and a heavy bike falling on my leg, and he didn't even bother looking at it. The second I went home, and told him, he ran to his bike and screamed his head off at me for getting scratches on it. I agree, there were a bunch of scratches, but it isn't my fault. It really pissed me off that he didn't Even bother looking at my burns and bleeds. We got into an argument, and he banned me from using any of the motorcycles at home. He also said he isn't going to buy me the car I was promised, and that he'd use my bank account to pay for the paint job and repairs for the bike. 


I don't think that's fair. I've been a good kid my whole life. I turned 18 a couple months ago. Everyone falls from their bikes while learning, and this wasn't even my fault, but now it looks like my dad and I have become mortal enemies. My mum is on my dad's side, saying I shouldn't have damaged his one and only prized possession, and that I shouldn't touch any geared vehicle anytime soon. It got me thinking I'm at fault, and I feel like shit now.


Tl;dr- My dad bought an expensive motorcycle which he recently let me start riding since I turned 18. I fell down and damaged it, but it wasn't my fault since someone pulled the choke and messed with the gears. My dad and mom have stripped me off my driving rights and are paying for the repair and paint job with the money that's in my account. I've been told it's my fault for so long that I actually feel like shit now. Am I the asshole here?"	Asshole	0	0

I saw a video on how to make eggs in a nest and I introduced them to my youngest brother (9) and he loves them. He loves them so much in fact that he asks me to make it for him every morning. Now, I love my brother for the whole world but I don't feel like wanting to make him it every morning. I've told him on some occassions that I didn't want to make eggs in the nest for him every morning and he says he understands but my mom insists that I make it for him anyways because he feels unloved when I reject him that way. I don't think he feels rejected and it's just my mom guilt-tripping me but I'm not sure, maybe it *is* me. AITA?	Not the A-hole	0	0
c655m2	2019-06-27 12:52:35	DidIStutter_	AITA for not saying anything to a dad that was an asshole to his son in the subway?	"I was commuting in the subway and sat down in front of a dad with his son and daughter. I'd say the daughter was 4, and the son maybe 10 (I'm not good at this). The daughter was mostly sleeping, she's not relevant to the story.

The son was trying to talk to his dad, who would not answer. Like outright ignoring him. And the son said things that made me think he was abused. ""Dad are you gonna get us from the subway station tonight? Because I always have to lie to (babysitter name) and say you're getting us home, and I don't want to lie anymore, so you have to come get us this time."" Which means the kid had to take care of himself and the little sister by himself? In a huge city?

The dad did not answer at all, the son was really looking anxious and kept saying ""dad? dad? answer me dad please? dad? please talk to me"" and then tapping the dad's shoulder and saying ""dad please stop being mad"". The dad was reading his book and looking the other way. Acting like a angry child. I was absolutely disgusted.

I don't know much about children but the kid looked really anxious about the situation, he was panicking that the dad was ignoring him and of course the dad was doing this on purpose. 

&#x200B;

Anyway. The dad is obviously an asshole, but am I too? Because I didn't say anything, at all. And I wanted to yell ""fucking answer your son!"" or ""stop being an asshole"" but I did not because I did not want to get the kid in trouble (and the man could have punched me because I'm a weak girl).

c6554c	2019-06-27 12:51:17	lynadeva	AITA for not giving up my friendship with someone after they had an argument with my best friend?	"Hey everyone,

This is my first post in this subreddit so please tell me if I'm doing anything wrong, also excuse my english please, as I am not a native speaker.

I will describe the situation as the following:

Me (a female) and my ex boyfriend broke up about 3 weeks ago, we used to be best friends before our relationship and we planned on still being friends after. 

We have a mutual Friend, let's call him ""Joe"", who knows my ex boyfriend since they were 11 years old, they are now 20 so it's a pretty long time.

After our breakup, I was pretty down and our mutual friend (Joe) talked to me and tried to comfort me, while I didn't know whether my ex and I could still be friends. In the week after our breakup, me and Joe did a lot of things, like going to the lake and eating dinner, watching Harry Potter. There has never been anything romantically going on between us and I see him as a normal friend and I have the feeling he sees me as a friend as well. 

While we were talking and he comforted me, he kind of stopped talking to my ex because our breakup was pretty bad and he said and did pretty hurtful things. My ex got annoyed with him for not being there for him as a friend and rather spending time with me. 

In an attempt to not make my boyfriend mad, Joe lied to him and told him he is with friends while he actually went to the cinema with me. (Sorry if this is confusing, I am trying to explain the situation as clear as I can)

I didn't know that he was lying to my ex and thought everything is fine between them and us. 

When my ex found out that he lied to him, he got very very angry with Joe and quit their friendship. He demanded that I am either not talking to Joe ever again because ""he disappointed me as a friend and because you are my best friend, you have to cut contact with him too"", otherwise my ex would also cut contact with me. 

I told him I don't want to decide on a side and that this whole thing is pretty dumb, because I don't want to give up either one of them as a friend. Now my ex is mad at me and Joe because he thinks I disappointed him as a friend. 

So... AITA? I think I should decide for myself who my friends are but my ex also has a point, that if someone would hurt me he would also stop talking to them so I should do the same for him.

Edit: A lot of people have been saying that Joe is trying to get me into bed and I understand the picture this whole situation paints but we have only platonic feelings for each other and also talked about this. We have been friends before, but now we've just got to do more things together"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c654yh	2019-06-27 12:50:49		"AITA for caling my step mom ""obese""?"	"A little background info: I'm a tall dude. 6'4 to be exact. And on the skinny side of the weight spectrum. Safe to say I'm pretty insecure about my frame. My step mom on the other hand is short and on the overweight side of the spectrum. So apparently she loves calling me out on my frame every time we have a family outing or dinner. I've told my dad that it bothers me and he said to ""just play it cool"" and that it's ""just how she is"". I just let it slide.

Recently my dad held a family gathering at the city beach. Everything's going good and I'm rekindling with cousins I haven't seen in months. Here comes Angry Step Mom stomping up to us, grinning ear to ear, and blurting out how ""skeletons shouldn't be caught swimming"" how it's a ""hazard"" for ""sticks"" to swim. My cousins giggle in what I can only assume is nervous laughter. I reply with "" as long as we're being safe we should also stop the obese whales from swimming, right?"" Her previous smile becomes a frown and she stomps off to who knows where.

My dad overhead the whole thing and scolded me about how I was ""out of line"" and disrespectful. My cousins also agree with my dad and one even said it was ""douchey"", yet no one says anything about Angry Step Mom. She has done this countless times and I've always played it cool but this time was the last straw for me... AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c654xk	2019-06-27 12:50:46	StudentNoob	AITA for not wanting to be a tour guide everyday for my cousin?	"So my cousin just came over from South Africa (has never been to the UK before) last week for a 6 week holiday.

He's been really good to have around, and I've shown him around the area, shown him basic stuff like where the shops are, currency we use, how to top up travelcards etc, buying him food etc. Often, because my parents are at work, it's been us two at home mainly. 

We've gone out almost everyday to the gym (in the mornings), and I've been showing him some sights for 3 of the 7 days. I've got him to try some British foods he hasn't tried back home as well and played a bit of xbox together. I've had some life admin to sort out in the meantime as I'm starting a new job in a few months and the paperwork has taken up a lot of time, so I haven't been 100% free. 

However, I do feel very guilty for not doing something everyday with him. I always make recommendations on where we could go. While I've recommended gently that he does some research of his own on what he might like to do  he hasn't really done so just yet. Whenever I ask, he says he's OK with doing whatever, which is fine, but doesn't help narrow down our choices in any way. So I do feel under constant pressure to find something to do together everyday, especially when he's spending 6 weeks here. 

My parents have reassured me that everything is fine and he appreciates everything, but I can't help but feeling I'm not doing enough somehow. Bearing in mind this is quite possibly my last extended summer I'll have, I'm also keen to have some time to myself without feeling guilty. 

My question is, AITA for not wanting to play tour guide for my cousin everyday?"	No A-holes here	0	0
c653zb	2019-06-27 12:48:16	Auroraborealis-sky	AITA for booking doctors appointment 1 month before pills run out?	"So I am on birth control and once a year go to the “doctor” to get more pills. Where I live there are centers for youths to go and talk or get birth control basically a big sex ed center for free. So I have to book an appointment to get more pills and I did, it was around 2 months until my pills ran out so I decided to book the appointment and it was a long wait time so I would be there when I had 1 month left of pills. Which in my opinion is enough but maybe it isn’t? 

So I then a few days from my appointment get called by them a lot in the middle of the class, ofc I cannot answer in the middle of the day as a high schooler so I call them back on my lunch break, no answer. They continue calling the next day and I go out from class just to answer and they say my appointment needs to be moved and they will give me 3 months without check up because I would run out before they have a free appointment. I am totally fine with it and I book a new time when I am free. 

So at this point I now come to the check up and it is all good. Then the lady just says in a really annoyed voice “oh yeah you unbooked the last one and because there was not enough time left on your pills you got 3 months extra”. I was really shocked because I didn’t cancel they did! Maybe I am the asshole but should I go 3 months in advanced? If I was a doctor I would not want to give out drugs when the patient had so much left incase of overtake or something which I know doesn’t happen with birth control, but just to be sure. 

If I go so early then what is the point of yearly check ups at the point i would be way above my yearly check up? I now have about 5 months left so when should i book my next appointment?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c65332	2019-06-27 12:45:58		AITA for alerting the FBI on a guy who used me to harass his ex?	"So I admit I (M30) was naive. This happened last night & I'm still so pissed at myself for not seeing it, & at being used.  

Background: I've never been confident about who I went out with or had sex with, but I recently lost weight & have been working on my body & confidence to the point where the feedback I been getting was making me feel good for once. I've been researching joining a couple or hanging out with other cool people I met here or kik but haven't yet tried anything.  

Story: So I saw this message last night posted in a local chat. It said there was a couple looking for a 3rd to join them & listed a girl's name & cell number to contact. That should've raised alarm bells right away, but it didn't. In my new mindset I figured it was worth a shot. I pm'd this dude & he starts telling me how they've done this before, & I should be in touch with his girl to arrange it. He kept saying he'd stay out of it, & that he'd send me pics and all. Then he said he was going to bed & I should let him know when things were arranged, and that he'd come by when they were.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I texted this girl & introduced myself, & right away I knew something was off. It took her a while to respond & when she did, it was extremely cold. Asking me ""Do I know you?"" I politely explained who I was & how I got her number, & if it was a mistake I'd leave & delete her number. Here were her words: ""WHATTT??? I don't have a BF he's a guy who's harassing me"" Right away I got this feeling in my stomach. She said she'd told him she didn't want to go out with this guy anymore but he wouldn't take no for an answer, & she asked me if he'd sent any pics of her, which I quickly assured her he hadn't but that he had offered. She thanked me for letting her know & I apologized & told her I'd delete her number. 

I was so pissed. I literally am new to this all & I've heard stories about guys. But to have been played like that, & to have been part of this guy's scheme to harass a girl? More than I could take.  

So I called the cops. 

I explained to them what this guy was doing & they told me there was a division FBI-affiliate division set up specializing in local cyber harassment like this, where they could track anything and everything. They were nice & helped me fill out a profile for the case. They said they were cracking down on things like this & would let me know once they'd been able to 

Meanwhile, I messaged this guy saying she hadn't answered me & must have gone to bed, I'd try again later tonight. 

Now, I'm not sure if I did the right thing. After all, he said one thing, & all I had was her word to go on. But it still felt wrong - like, how is that ok to drop a girl's number publicly just because she won't go out with you- & I hate that I was played. Deep down, I'm waiting for this guy to message me admitting what he did & saying that he'd leave this girl alone, but I know that's probably not gonna happen.

Now we are happily married and we have a 2 year old daughter. Before she was born we were attending the festival every year then stopped for a while, because newborn. Now, when our daughter is 2 year old we are considering going again, this time with her. My parents think it's a horrendously bad idea and are pushing for us to leave the kid with them for babysitting. I know that they would take good care of their granddaughter but there is one issue. My father is religious, bigoted and borderline racist. He calls it conservative. I call it being a horrible asshole. We obviously don't get along whatsoever and I don't really want him to be with my daughter unsupervised. When I come back I don't want to have to correct all the ""knowledge"" and ""worldviews"" he would inevitably bestow on my daughter. I would ask my mother to come to our place for the time of our trip but she acts like I am making too much of my father talks and he is basically a good man who has a grumpy facade. So even if she promises to come alone, she would bring him along. She also points out that it's going to be hot and dusty on the festival grounds and even if we avoid loud music and buy some toddler-sized ear muffs it still won't be enough of a protection. She also says that even if my father talks some shit in her presence she probably won't remember it anyway because she is too young. I think she has a point there but it still makes me uncomfortable to think of her possibly soaking some of that anyway. Moreover both me and my husband were on this particular festival multiple times and we believe we can handle everything just fine and in a way that would be safe for our daughter. Would we be the assholes if we took her with us? EDIT: The festival has  a family camp area. It's fenced and you have to pay extra to enter and camp there, no random passerbys. There are toilets, warm water, electricity, playground, pool etc. The rule is you can't bring alcohol there so I assume it is safe for all the kids and the families. It's always full and you have to make reservations early but I think it's worth it and would make it possible for me and husband to take turns with attending the ""real"" festival""."	Asshole	0	0

This happened an hour ago and I’m currently sitting/hiding in my room, waiting for the fire to settle so I can properly celebrate my dad. 

I’m 21 and staying home this summer doing grownups shores at my parents house. My mother is also working at home but has recently been helping her dad with a side project of his that involves a lot work. 
Before she came home today she called me and asked what we were missing to make dinner. I heard that she was irritated at something. She then came home and went into my room and asked when we should start dinner. I was playing at that moment and said that i would be done in 10 min and that we could start after that since we could pre cook dinner today, she agreed.

I then entered the kitchen and she was making herself some quick lunch. Since she was sitting down to eat and use her phone I decided that i would wrap dads present meanwhile. Thats done and she tells me that she is a bit “tired” because she and her dad were disagreeing. I told her that it was okay and that i were glad that she wasn’t angry at me. She then told me that the food on the counter needed to be sorted and thrown in the trash. I sorted the food and filled the dishwasher, She was still reading on her phone. So I sat down beside her with the intention to rest a short while with her...

She then got up after 1 minute, changed clothes walked to the counter and said that she would cook alone. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that she was disappointed, thought I was lazy, that I couldn’t do anything whilst she was working super hard at her dads, etc. At this point arguing is wasted time so I told her that i was sorry, that i would take out the compost and leave her to it.

I have a friend (tilly) who is 21f she weighs 400 pounds (last time I asked), I had to stop inviting her out because a 10 minute walk would turn into a half an hour walk because we would have to stop every 5/10 minutes for her to rest. we have missed movies and she cant do anything because of her size. 
she also showers once every 4 or so days but because of her size she cant wash everything and so she will normally stink, and sadly it's the kind of stink you notice. 

I started suggesting we do fun stuff at her place as an alternative and it worked for a while untill she caught on and asked me why we never go out. I just explained that it was because of her weight and that I struggle to walk that slowly and have that many stops. 
I also kind mentioned the shower thing because it can be bad.

Yesterday when I got off work I  dragged all the huge branches into his yard and took my chainsaw and cut them up into very small pieces so as to avoid having him put them back on my side again.

I'm a 21-years old student and was on my way to the bus station today. There's a crossroad on my way where you can easily see cars coming around, and I was in a bit of a hurry and just crossed the road at a red light.
Now, on the opposite was a group of small children, led by some teachers I guess. I wasn't really thinking any of it and just walked on. 
At the next light I waited and was approached by an elder man, telling me how rude I was for simply crossing the road and not waiting and being a bad example for the children. 
I told him I didn't care and told him to mind his own business.

"Of course with all Reddit posts, there’s a ton of background here and I will try to make this brief. I know family related posts can get intense so I created a throwaway. I have a good marriage with normal ups and downs. My desire in life is to be a stay at home parent, my kids are my passion and I get more joy out of being with them and watching them grow and learn than I could any job. I do however do bookkeeping from home so I have a decent income(think I make as much as a new school teacher). However my husband confessed to me early this year that he’s tired of feeling like we don’t have the material things his friends do. He said he talked with his mom and she would be happy to watch the kids for free as a test run this summer. 

I reluctantly agreed and asked my work for a full time position while I study for the CPA. I’ve had major issues with my MIL, when it comes to food (worst example: she allowed my kids to eat nothing but marshmallows for an entire weekend), politics+religion (won’t get into it but we don’t agree and she always says things like “xxxxx is evil but don’t tell your mom I said that”) and safety (she flaunts the kids not wearing bike helmets and again tells the kids not to tell me). 

I was also exceptionally taken aback because before I got my first full time check my husband had taken out a loan at line 9% APR for a wakeboarding boat. I know he’s wanted this for a long time but the unilateral decision really, really bothered me. 

We are a month in and it’s not gone well to up to Yesterday. The kids have been repeatedly sick so I’m pretty sure she’s not following my food rules, they have had almost zero active time and she parks them in front of phones to watch unsupervised YouTube literally all day long. I brought both up with her and told her that when I was home with them we cooked together, we did play groups, we went to the zoo and did art camps. She head-nodded me to death and then when I left she apparently called my husband because when I saw him next he told me I needed to go easier on her because she’s why we can afford so many nice things now. Poor choice of words dude. 

Then yesterday she had two separate trips to the ER for 2 of the 3 kids. One severe sprain and one burn because my 6 year old was hungry for something besides candy and tried to make a pizza. Both will be fine but in addition to kids being hurt, she took them to exact ER I told her NOT to take them to and now we are going to have months long battle to try to get insurance to cover the bills. 

Edit: an exceptionally ignorant and argumentative commenter below is taking exemption to the ER thing. To be clear, I would have handled the burns and bruises at home. My MIL in panicked and took both kids to the ER. And she drove past the one I told her to go to in order to take them to one she was “more familiar” with. So it’s out of network meaning we are at least in for a months long battle trying to get insurance to cover and there’s a good chance we may be out thousands of dollars for these Er trips. We couldn’t potentially afford the goddamned boat (that had already needed extensive work  not in warranty) BECAUSE of these ER trips.

Id had it and told my work in going back to part time. I told my husband the boat is being sold and that was that. He is furious with me so is MIL.

c64tb3	2019-06-27 12:17:06	throwaway48e8e	AITA because I was ungrateful about my gift.	"throwaway as I honestly think I'm an asshole, just wanted judgment. 

this happend around 5 years ago but I was laptop shopping and was reminded of this. 

when I started year 10 (age 14) we where told that it was byod (bring your own devices) 
as it was coming up to Christmas mum and dad decided that a laptop would make a great gift. 

here is where the issue starts, mum decided to go on the school website and jot down the list of specifications that the school laptop needs and then just hand the paper to a tech guy and buy the cheapest laptop she can. 
the one thing I said I wanted in a laptop was a disk drive as I wanted to play the sims. 

because she did not look into what laptop she got I got a laptop without a disk drive that was super flimsy and cheap. 
If i remember it was under 500$ because mum went for the lest expensive one that had all the specs the school needed. 
I was told that mum brought it withought asking any questions. 

we have money my parents just hate spending it. 

I was happy at first but then got annoyed because of how laggy it was and it had trouble connecting to the wifi, and that was the main reason I needed it. 
I also had to double protect it as it felt like it could break from the books in my school bag.  

mum got mad at me when she heard me complaining to dad about how laggy and disk driveliss it is. I was also telling dad that I thought I had broke it on the way to school. 

she then started calling me ungrateful.

He hasn't talked to her for about 2 years since they got into what I believe was a political argument. He was diagnosed last year with inoperable stage 4 cancer, no treatments, just dying. He has barely been back to the hospital since. One of his wishes is for nobody to tell his daughter who lives hundreds of miles away what is happening. I think it's selfish myself. Problem is now my stepsister has gotten a hold of me, will be in the area and wants to get together, will I be the asshoe by opening up a big can of worms for a dying man that just wants to be left alone really.

c64skn	2019-06-27 12:15:17	throwaway50076	AITA for taking a day off for stress?	"To start this one off a little (lot) background:

I have an anxiety disorder since birth that’s caused me to be depressed since I was a child. Anxiety meds didn’t work so I’ve been bare-knuckling through most of my days and every few months or so I end up taking a day off to wind down. Without something to calm me or reset I end up basically going into fight-or-flight mode for the whole day and I’ll either get close to breaking things or snapping and start throwing punches. I don’t want to do any of that but when I’m in that mode and can’t exactly run away from work I start freaking out.

My father has dealt with a lot of stress over the years after he got laid off (a month after buying a house right at the peak of the crisis) and long story short after getting a new job he can barely afford it. He did have several opportunities to go back to his old job but he turned them down since there was no guarantee it was permanent (2/3 he was offered ended up being permanent). He has a non-union job now and makes about half of what he used to. He’s typically irresponsible with money and would rather risk overdrawing his account than go a couple days without beer. A few months ago he was finally able to make the monthly mortgage and we could still afford food, but he decided he needed a new truck too. He rarely drives it since neither of us have any money to go out and is already a month behind. He’s been borrowing from family to keep it and now we’re now set back to square 1 because we’re borrowing money every month again.

Due to circumstances we live together and work together. I make $300 a week on 40 hrs but I had to buy tools (required for work) so I only get $250 for the next few months. He wants $300 for rent.

AITA: For a little over a week I’ve been super stressed, in and out of FoF mode every day and generally nothing causing it. When my dad gets mad or yells or even looks upset/pissed off it puts me in fight or flight even on normal days and if I try to take a moment he typically takes it to yell at me about how I’m not stressed, I don’t know what stress is. If I ever try to take a day off to set myself right it prompts an early morning bitch fit where he yells, stomps around throwing things and slamming doors. It’d be almost laughably childish if it didn’t make me terrified and depressed. This morning I spoke up though, started saying that he doesn’t even try to understand how my disorder affects me but he cut me off saying that I “don’t understand shit, try paying a mortgage and take care of two kids, see if that’s stressful” as if I wasn’t just as stressed about the mortgage.

c64prg	2019-06-27 12:06:45	Mrceruleanblue	AITA for 'victim-blaming' my bullied cousin by telling him he doesn't deserve friends?	"So my friend Mason is rising junior at a different school. He gets bullied, all verbally. The reason is that he's kind of shy and reclusive, and doesn't have that great of social skills. His mom asked me to talk to him to give him advice, since I'm more 'popular' (so my mom says). So we went over to his house and to his room. We had a conversation, and he talked a lot about how he 'deserves' to have friends and be popular. I asked him if he wanted blunt honesty, and he said yes, so I told him that he doesn't 'deserve' popularity or friends. Nobody *automatically* is entitled to friends and popularity, him included. I told him, to have friends and popularity, you need to give people a reason to hang out with you: you're funny, or you have great social skills, or are good at sports (classic example). My point is that to have friends and be popular, you have to bring something to the table that makes people want to be around you. Just sitting and waiting for friends to drop from the sky is useless.

He accused me of victim-blaming, saying he shouldn't have to do anything and it's the bullies that should stop. I told him that in an ideal world, yes, the bullies would stop. But that's not how it works. Mason's family has gone to the administrators multiple times, to no avail. So the only real option he has to begin with is to improve himself and make friends. I don't think that's victim-blaming, just reality.

But he wouldn't hear it, and told me to get out.

c64lys	2019-06-27 11:55:18	MiddleagedHuman	AITA being excluded from my gaming group	"Ive been playing Overwatch regularly for about 8 months. One of the main reasons is that ive had a friend group to play with. Weve basically been doing competetive games several days every week, to increase our rankings. 
We all met online but it really felt like an actual friendship. Theres even been plans of meeting irl. And everyone tries to support each other with real life problems.

Howeever in the last month, ive basically started being excluded from the group. I usually get online after work, early in the evening. Usually the group is full by then already and doing competitive games. But usually, as soon as someone leaves i get an invite. Not anymore.

The only time i actually get invited is very late in the evening, when its almost midnight. Usually most of the group has left by then, and theres only the leader left. He basically just tells me ""join"".

Now at this time, im already planning to sleep, because i have work every weekday. But at the same time, im tired of playing alone and genuinly want to do some competitive games. So i usually stay up later than i should just to do that. But i also realise that i really shouldnt. And being reduced to ""standin"" every time, really isnt fun in itself.

Now one day, i basically play alone for 2+ hours, waiting to get a spot. Suddenly i see one of theyre members leave. Im thinking ""maybe ill get a spot this time"". Then i just see one of my other friends get online and they invite her instead.

At this point, i kinda snap. Ive basically been excluded every day for one month without explanation. So i decide to write a polite question to the group leader. I basically ask ""hey m8. No offense, but do you guys actually want to play with me anymore? I just waited 2 hours for an inv just yo see you inv someone else that just got online. I just want to know so i can start looking for another competitive group instead :)"".

And i get no answer whatsoever. After waiting for almost an hour i basically start getting irritated. So i get kinda childish and write ""ill take the silence as a yes :p"". Shortly afterwards i just log off entirely. The next time i talk to them, the whole things basically been ignored. 

Now i know that im not entitled to always being invited. It just really sucks to be excluded without any explanation. Especially when ive told people in the group several times that id love to be invited, since i hate playing alone. And they always tell me that they will. But it never happens.

I can't control who I like or who I dislike. And I just happen to dislike my younger brother. I find him annoying. He talks to loud, he always gets away with stupid shit and when he interupts me when I’m talking nobody tell him so, but when i do it I get yelled at. I’ll admit it, I am jealous of him. Hr gets all the attention and I’m just the middle child who nobody notices. 

I do not like him. I isolate myself from him, because I just get so mad when he's around. When i get mad i have a hard time controlling myself from lashing out, especially towards him. So i try to isolate myself from him so that doesn't happen. 

My mom sometimes tell me that because I do that he thinks that I don't like him. But when I tell her that I suspect that my older brother doesn't like me she just brushes it off and says “yes he does”. 

I don’t know if it's just a thing where the older sibling doesn't like the younger sibling, but even if it is everyone makes me feel so guilty about it. Idk if its that or if it's just small things that have built up and expanded over the years. But whatever it is, I feel guilty at times, but then it’s just replaced with rage.

c64i8j	2019-06-27 11:43:12		AITA- Upset roommate hid her relationship with me?	"This happened two years ago now but I’ve always wanted an outside opinion. 

I was starting my freshman year of college and decided to room with a very close friend ( Paula) from home who I’d known since 8th grade. Initially very excited. Then, she started leaving all the time on weekends and some school days to visit another friend (Kara) from home who went to college an hour away. Paula was never there to make friends the first couple of months, and would often cry to me about not having friends. Of course I invited her to hangout w me and any new friends I had made, but then she would cry about how I was closer to everyone. 

Fast forward to October, our good friend makes a joke about Paula and Kara dating. Paula freaks out and asks who told her. We were confused, and then Paula finally tells us she has been dating Kara for TWO YEARS secretly, only one other person knew. I was in a state of shock when she told me. I asked why she hadn’t told anyone and she said it was because they weren’t gay and didn’t want people to judge them. I found this weird, I have a gay brother and gay aunt, and am openly pro LGBTQ, so I don’t know why I would judge her. It also made me feel weird as as friends, I had shared all my romantic life w her, but she had not done the same with me. 

Following me finding out, Paula said I couldn’t tell anyone, which became very hard as I had to hide it from all my college friends, who would ask me where Kara was ( visiting her secret GF) and I would make excuses for her weekly. I also could not tell my family, which was hard, specifically my mom. 

After I found out, Kara would spend the night all the time in our dorm ( about every other weekend) which is when I got upset my roommate didn’t tell me earlier she was dating someone. I would have preferred a roommate that was single, as I was, and when Kara and I decided to room together we talked about going out together and boys in college, something that obviously never happened because she had a secret gf. 

So, lay it on me: AITA for being upset my close friend didn’t disclose she was in a relationship before rooming with me?"		1	0
c64hhh	2019-06-27 11:40:48	Lyrial	AITA for not wanting to take my son to my FILs house?	"My son is nearly 1.5 years old and my FIL hasn’t met him. He lives in another country to us and never once tried to come up and see us/him despite being really excited to be a grandfather (he has other grandkids but due to family issues he’s never met them. 

Traveling that distance is really hard for us as our son is a really bad traveller and a stickler for routine. It’s also really expensive for the three of us to travel vs one of him.

Despite this we finally decided to visit as I could see how upset my husband was getting that his dad hadn’t met our son. 

We’ve flown to see him (flight was awful!). Paid to stay in a hotel as FIL said his spare room wasn’t ready for guests hired a car as FIL didn’t want to come meet us at airport.

We went to his house yesterday and his three dogs were all over our son who can only just walk and not very well. One dog was growling and barking and showing his teeth and they had to put him on a lead (but they took him off several times and let him dig his claws in my leg while trying to get to my son).

These dogs don’t spend time around anyone including any kids so i was really quite worried when they were all over him (I held him cause I was too scared to put him down and the dogs were jumping up my legs and licking my sons arms and legs).

When we left I was actually shaking with adrenaline as I’d spend the whole time on high alert worried my son was going to get hurt.

Today we told FIL we weren’t comfortable coming round again cause of the dogs and that our son needs to be able to walk/crawl around and we’d be scare the dogs would knock him over and hurt him. He got all defensive saying the dogs just wanted to be a part of the family and he wouldn’t put them in a separate room.

So we said we could all go to a local soft play to let my son run around safely but FIL said he can’t leave his dogs home alone and was mad that we wouldn’t come over.

My husband is really upset by his father’s behaviour. I can’t decide whether we are being completely reasonable or if we’ve been over the top on our reaction.

We’ve spent so much money on this trip too and FIL won’t even come 10 mins down the road from his house!

I have OCD and preparing, and even eating, food can be difficult and often impossible for me.  I feel tied to the wall by fear of illness. Any time I try to address it, tensions go so high I can't function in any facet of my life. My health goes out, I wake from a dead sleep with panic attacks over and over, my work goes completely to shit...my hubs and I fight, I just hate it.

Meds is not a option, only therapy, I toe around the problem. If I don't face it, it's fine. This puts me in a spot regarding cooking, I don't know how & I'm so afraid of failure,making people sick. It takes me hours to do a task that would take my husband 20 minutes. He is chill with hygiene. I tend to not watch to keep myself from panic. I wash my hands about 5 times to his 1, he doesn't use soap which saves him more fuss. I also have a fear of chemicals, so I need soap in my life and am also afraid of soap. Worry I will get soap in the food. 

He thinks that raw eggs are OK, as long as you're not elderly/pregnant. I disagree.  I can't stand chicken, at all. I eat lamb, beef and salmon. I love all veg, fruits, beans, grains. If I had my say, i'd be a vegetarian. I am a fussy eater, but there is a lot I can eat. My hubs has ignored this from day one, I've said I'd like to be vegetarian, he says no. I'd probably be too unhealthy, I eat a lot of junk too. 

I've told my hubs again and again, if he wants something he knows I will struggle to eat, he can have it on his own, don't make any for me. If I say something is not OK, he will make more. He made a dish and put a boiled egg in it. I said ""save that egg, don't give me one"" he gave me one. I threw it away ""I can't"" The next day, he made Japanese pancakes, full of egg and pork. It was creamy and hard to discern the egg was cooked. He watched me push it around the plate, and asked ""what are you doing?"" 

""Why aren't you eating it?"" I've calmly explained I'd prefer to just not have a serving made for me, I've tried to eat the foods and gagged on them. I feel guilty when I don't eat the food. He's insisted that I will eat things as they are served to me. ""You'll eat it"" as he puts it in front of me, knowing I will scoop it out and eat the rest of it. He seems irritated when I don't eat something, despite my never eating it before, and constantly expressing my anxieties and disgust. He then tells me I shouldn't feel that way and to eat it, because it's healthy. I feel trapped, if it were up to me i'd never have a carton of eggs in my house again. To make it worse, we've had a tonne of recalls on eggs lately, so many brands have come out one by one for microbial contamination. 

I have so much anxiety that only MY serving will be underdone/off, in the process of trying to save myself from a panic, I offend by husband. He keeps giving me food, knowing how I feel, then gets to punish me for it.

I've had a long time habit of breaking into a jog when I see a car waiting to turn. It doesn't save much time, but I've always seen it as a small act of politeness. A way to say ""I see you are waiting, and I value your time.""

A friend absolutely hates it, they think that it's, in fact, polite of them to wait the full time it takes us to cross the road at a comfortable pace.

My dad speaks English since he works here and he is fine with me speaking English. My mom, however, doesn't know proper English, and is usually annoyed that I speak English, not French.

I never bothered to learn the language and my parents don't enforce it or anything but my mom guilt-trips me for not speaking it. This is probably because when we go on holiday to France, I can barely speak French to my cousins and elders. My cousins are fine with it since they can speak English themselves. My elders can't understand the majority of what I say though, which is what ticks my mom off. 

She feels that I should be respectful to my heritage by speaking it but I can't be bothered to learn French. I can't even read it!

c641a4	2019-06-27 10:48:22	fantasy_is_reality	AITA for yelling at my mom for barging into my obgyn's office right after my appointment?	"I'm a 21 year old girl. I have PCOS and have had irregular and painful periods my whole life. Around 5 months ago, I was told by my obgyn to do some hormonal tests and bring her the results. Due to busy schedules and traveling (and the fact they need to be done at a certain point in the cycle, which is a problem since my periods are irregular) I wasn't able to do them until last month. However, the past 3 months my period was somewhat regular, but still extremely painful. I tried to make an appointment with my obgyn since last month, but was only able to get one today.

Today when I came into her office, she was pretty pissed off and told me how disrespectful it is to come after half a year and expect her to be okay with it. I explained why I couldn't do it and apologized, and then she asked the dates of my previous periods. After I told her, she got all snarky and said ""Your periods are perfectly regular, just take a painkiller"". I said that painkillers do nothing for me, and she said ""You're supposed to take them a few days prior"". I said I can't because my period isn't regular, and she said ""But it is"".

She said I for some reason needed to do those tests again in a few days, I said I wouldn't be able to since I'll be traveling again. At this point she lost her shit.

""Why did you even come today? You come here 2 days before your period is supposed to start, and tell me that you can't even do the tests. Why the HELL did you even show up TODAY? What did you even expect? It's NOT POSSIBLE medically to do anything for you now.""

I felt like shit. After I got out, my mom was waiting for me (she had an appointment in the same place), and I told her ""she yelled at me"". My mom asked what happened, and after I told, she said ""let me talk to her"". I said NO, but my mom literally barged into her office to ask her about my tests.

After she came back, I lost my shit. I yelled at her and told her that she can't just barge into people's offices like that, and that I feel embarrassed. That my doctor already thought I was a pos, but now she probably thinks I'm a spoiled brat whose mom needs to do shit for her. That she's making me look bad and that I'm not 5 years old and don't need my mom to defend me. Mom kept saying ""I was just worried, I just wanted to ask her what the problem was"", and when I said ""You could've asked me"", she said ""You wouldn't be able to explain it, you're not a doctor"".

I'm so mad. I feel like a 5 year old kid who's crying for her mom because someone pushed her on the playground. My mom doesn't understand why I'm mad and thinks I'm an asshole because she ""has the right to know what's going on with my health"". I disagree. I'm an adult and no one except for me has that right. I feel humiliated and honestly thinking of changing doctors because I'm too embarrassed to come back there again.

She gets rather aggressive quickly, to which I respond that since I don't know her, I'm going to decline her.

&#x200B;

She went straight into saying that if I don't add her, I shouldn't have facebook, and question why I got 'famous' people as friends, and starts calling me names.

I simply replies with the fact that I've seen the band, I've meet the members and spoken quite a lot with the singer. And it's my choice who I befriend on facebook.

**She rages, and then blocks me.**

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the 25th this month. **4 months after this whole thing happened.**

She leaves a comment on my profile pic, letting me know I'm disgusting, a coward, and other names that I simply don't know how to translate to english, and let's me know that she hasn't forgotten about me and is still angry.

&#x200B;

I got all the screenshots of the convo and her comment, and sends them to her mother, along with notifying her that I won't hasitate to consult the police if it continues.

And I post the screenshot of her comment on facebook asking for help.

I head on and call the police to consult the situation (which we both said is odd).

They think I've done a good job saving everything, and sending it to the mum. They ask me if I want to file a report for harrassment, I decline.

They ask me to let her know that I don't want any contact with her, so I did.

&#x200B;

I woke up yesterday (26th) to 10 notifications from her, and her mum responds that she wants to call me, so we call.

This wasn't the first time she's done something like this, and this is why all of her friends are online. And she has both Autism and ADHD, and she explains that due to that, she becomes really emotional and so on. 

&#x200B;

**I screenshot all of her comments, delete them and then block her.**

She wrote that she would seek up my address and come and find me, an other said that the police won't do anything, and that her mum won't tell her off.

I call the police again to consult, as they instructed me to do if something else happened.

I file a police report in hope to gain a restraining order, since she will be going to the same convention as me in July, and since I will be working in their healthcare group, I'll be very easy to find.

And, finding my address is an easy thing to do, due to my not-so-common lastname, and all of that info is public in Sweden.

&#x200B;

Note: The legal age of criminal responsibility in Sweden is 16.

I've got PTSD from **previous traumas,** and it causes some irrational fear and toughts.

&#x200B;

**25/2 She sent request - I ask, then decline - She blocks me**

**25/6 She left the comment - I notify her mum and consult the police - I ask her to leave me alone, politely**

**26/6 She spams me with threaths - I call her mum - I screenshot & delete her comments, and block her - File report for restraining order**

c63w7y	2019-06-27 10:30:13		AITA For refusing to take care of my wife's dog?	"3 years ago: We lived in military housing at the time and already had 3 cats (only allowed 2 pets). They are ""her"" cats and we agreed that they are her responsibility financially and in terms of care.

My wife started talking about getting a dog. I said under no circumstances do I want another animal in the house, especially because that'd mean we have double the amount of pets allowed. I don't want to jeapordize our living situation because of another pet. You can be kicked out for this. I should add that in Hawaii, military housing is way cheaper than living off base, so there was financial risk as well. 

She agreed and relented. One day she called me while I was at work and said ""Don't be mad, but I went to the humane society and got a dog"". I hung up on her. When I got home I exploded and said she went behind my back and got this animal and she had no right to do that when we both agreed not to get a dog. I said it was underhanded and betrayed my trust, and she was being selfish by putting us at risk of getting kicked out. 

She started bawling her eyes out and said she was just lonely and wanted a pet that ""gives a shit if she's home or not"" and she hoped if I met the dog I'd come around and let it stay. I didn't budge and said she needs to take the dog back. She said I'm a dick and that it would be cruel and unfair to the dog. I said it was her fault for creating that situation in the first place, not mine for sticking to the original agreement.

After 2 days of arguing I finally said she could keep it on one condition: I will have no part in this dog's care. It is solely her responsibility and I will not lift a finger to help with it or pay for its care in any way. She agreed.

Fast forward to now. I'm not a totally heartless bastard and do help with small things like feeding him and letting him out when my wife is not home because he's a good dog. It's not his fault.

The situation at hand: My wife wants to go out with her friends on Friday after work & asked if I could feed all the animals and let the dog out, etc. I said no, I'm going to the bar after work (as is tradition on payday Friday and she knows this). I said it's not my problem. She will just have to come home first. She said that I'm ruining her plans because she needs to leave directly from work to be there on time & coming home first would ruin her chances of finding decent parking downtown, etc. I said its not my problem and reminded her of the conditions of keeping the dog. At this final refusal, she lost it. She said I just need to ""get over it"" because her dog is ""a part of the family now"" and I'm being an asshole to the dog. She said that I can ""go to the bar any time"" and I should just come home first. I said she should have planned around it instead of assuming I'd do it. I again refused and am now getting the silent treatment.

TLDR: My wife is angry that I am refusing to take care of her dog that I am not responsible for so that she can go out with her friends. Am I the asshole?"		1	0

c63vmb	2019-06-27 10:28:01	BuoyantArmiger	AITA /AWTA for leaving my brother's wedding because we felt exhausted/ like we were being used?	" Posting just the TL;DR because my initial post was way too long.

  
TL;DR:

* My  Half brother (Sam) was getting married. He is one of two sons from my  mom's old (abusive) relationship. The wedding is going to happen at my  mum's ex-husband's farm.
* My mom married my Dad from another country so we have to travel quite far and barely know anyone at the wedding
* My parents are both in their 70s and have health conditions, so they tire easily
* The wedding happens, and because Sam likes to party, there's an unofficial plan to party for 3 days until 5 am every night.
* My  parents get exhausted from talking to people they've never really met  (which is fun initially but doesn't last) and they can't stay up that  late so we decide to go home every night around midnight. Every time we  decide to up and leave my brother Sam would get pushy, trying to make us  feel bad for leaving and trying to get us to stay longer.
* Aside  from that, we quickly feel like we're being used for the sake of our  presence, not because people (especially my mom's ex-husband's family)  really want us there.
* After  3 days of going along with it and having fun as much as we can, we  decide to stop going for a 4th day. This is met with hostility by my  brother but also the family at the farm. We explain that we'd be glad to  see them but we don't want to meet them at the farm anymore. We going  out to dinner somewhere but this suggestion also gets turned down-  instead we would have to come to the farm. Having said our goodbyes the  day before already, we spend the day doing something else and fly back  home the following morning.
* After  coming home we get a lot of angry phone calls and text messages from my  brother saying we fucked up the whole situation. Are we the assholes?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c63tl1	2019-06-27 10:20:49		AITA for wanting to choose the flowers I want for our wedding?	"TLDR; My SO wants to rethink our marriage because she doesn’t like the flowers my mother chose for the wedding.

SO and I have been together for 4 years and are in the midst of planning for our wedding.

Everything in the wedding so far has been decided by SO and I (location, invitations, guests, etc) but it’s mostly been up to SO to have the final decision as I have been happy with what has been chosen.

However, this week my mother wanted to help out by deciding the flowers for our wedding and SO doesn’t like the decision. My mother is insisting she really wants to help out our wedding and that the flowers will be paid by her as well. I thought it was very generous and thoughtful of my mother but my SO wants some other type of flower or floral arrangement. My mother is upset because she’s already ordered the flowers and arranged for them and I thought since everything else has been done to SO’s liking what would be wrong with having the flowers as what I want. I honestly don’t mind whatever flowers we have but since they’re already bought and everything else so far has been done to SO’s liking we could compromise on this decision. We also come from a culture where we should respect our elders decisions and I feel it’s really something small to compromise for our wedding. I told her I want these flowers since they’re already paid for but she got very upset asking if it’s really what I want and since when did flowers mean so much to me and isn’t it just because my family wants them.

I told my SO that when my mother suggested invitations, she liked them so we decided to go with those invitations, but because the flowers aren’t to her taste we can’t just refuse. That it’s selfish to only accept what we want but not allow the rest of the family to input anything else about our wedding. I told my SO when we’re marrying we are marrying into each other’s families as well and we should accept and respect their decisions too.

Now my SO has said that she wants to rethink the wedding and my decisions because I don’t seem to care about her thoughts?
She has said that she wishes we had planned out the entire wedding then told our in laws.

I feel like my SO is being very selfish/overreacting and disrespectful to my family but SO seems to think I’m the asshole for putting my foot down on the flowers I want for our wedding.

Edit: I changed the tldr from flowers I chose to flowers my mother chose after reading the responses.

SO has put me in a position a few times in the relationship where I felt I had to choose between her and my mother so perhaps that is the issue. 

I’m the only child and my father passed away when I was very young so I have always felt my mother wanted to be included in my life moreso. I have told my SO I will prioritize her mostly but will listen to both sides and choose the judgement I feel right whenever I’m in such a position but it is hard to be the middle man."	Asshole	0	0

As we were walking, my fiancee ended up stopping us and proceeded to pick some flowers off a tree that was overhanging the path. This is a fairly crowded park and there were people all around who saw us stop to pick the flowers. As this was happening I then told my fiancee that she shouldn't be taking flowers off public plants because if everyone did that no one would be able to enjoy them. Let's just say that conversation did not go down well.

I guess my question is AITA here for being a busybody, and what is the morality of picking flowers off of public plants? When googling this, I was met with a very mixed response that seemed to lean opposite my opinion and I could use some guidance here. This is not a validation post, the conversation itself was civil, but we genuinely think the other is totally wrong.

c63sp5	2019-06-27 10:17:34	Mono_bri	AITA for not wanting to house sit	"Hello, 
First time poster lifetime reader.

For some context:
  I'm 23yrs old and often watch the house for my parents when they go outnof town. Even though my 32 yr old brother still lives at home they always call me to house sit for them. 
Now my brother has always been a pain in my tushie. He's definitely in a different mind frame than me too say the least. For a very long time he's had these angry outbursts where on mutiple occasions I've almost had to call the cops on him because he would try and get physical. I've tried to tell my parents but only my dad believes me. My mom doesn't want to believe her ""baby boy"" could really do those things. (I have scars to prove her wrong)
But as usually things end up with me taking the heat from my mother; because even with endless proof I always get the same line ""why can't you get along with your brother?"" 
Another thing to note is my parents aren't big fans on dog hair(its relevant I promise) and my chihuahua likes to jump up on the couch when he thinks no one's around. He also has a bad habbit of peeing on the floor. So every night I put him in his cage before I go to bed. 
My brother works late and comes home well after I'm alseep and he thinks that the cage is too small for him and let's him out EVERY. FREAKING. TIME. and every morning I get flack because ""he's my responsibility to be put into the cage"".
I knew it was him and I even started taking photos/videos  as proof. And the very next day I still get blamed by my mom. Why? I have no freaking clue.

Now the story:
I'm house sitting for my parents this whole week and the night before they left they stayed up late to pack, 11pm rolls around and I put my dog in his cage and go back in the living room to read before I go to sleep. 12 am and my brother comes into the house and tells me it's ""cruel"" to let him sleep in the cage. I tell hin everytime that mom and dad don't like it when he's left out and unattended. After some back and forth and a little threat about hurting me he tells me he'll put him back into the cage. I'm already freaked out because when he says something physical he'll do it. 
Next morning my mom wakes me up frustrated that he was left out. I tell her what my brother said and she goes ""Mono you're 23 stop blaming your brother and just take care of your dog"". I was livid.
So am I in the wrong for wanting to just leave the house and have him watch it. I don't live with them so I have nothing there besides my dogs. He doesn't take care of the house at all. (Wash dishes, water the yard, feed the dogs, sweep the floors) I do all that stuff while I'm there. So am I in the wrong to just get up and leave???

Edit: just incase it wasnt clear I do live away from my parents. And its more of my mom that takes his side, my dad has always tried to take my side but my mom always gets upset when he does."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I grew up travelling and living overseas a lot, especially in Africa because my dad used to work as a diplomat before he retired. At one of the international schools, I became friends with a girl who we'll call Emma. Emma was the daughter of my biology teacher. We were really close, hung out a lot and she moved back to Europe before I did (we're from different countries but close enough).  I moved to the UK 8 years ago and we've always kept in touch, whenever we've met up and I've met with her friends or partners she's always introduced me as her oldest and closest friend. 

I was with my ex boyfriend for three years, we met online. Purely coincidentally, Emma began dating my ex's best friend from Uni. Every now and again, they'd visit the city we lived in to hang out with mutual friends of my ex and her partner but I'd never get told that she was even in the city. At this point I'd realised our friendship was beginning to phase out.  

A year ago, Emma and her boyfriend got engaged and my partner was immediately asked to be groomsman at the wedding.

Not long after this, for various reasons, my ex and I broke up and when Emma found out she said she was sorry, and that she's here for me if I need to talk, which she never was on the occasions when I did message and try to reach out.  I found out through social media that she'd done a big thing about picking her bridesmaids and maid of honor for her wedding and I can't help but to feel a bit sad and left out because she always made a big deal about how good friends we were but it's very clear now the friendship was always a bit one sided. She's published a couple of book and when I was asking for advice about my own writing she'd scoff and say ""You're never going to get publish unless you write 100,000 words."" 

Her maid of honour invited me to the hen party but I had recently become unemployed and couldn't afford the travel up to London so after that I never received a wedding invite, even though I'd previously been invited to engagement party when I was with my ex.

Their wedding was last month. I decided that instead of dealing with all the social media photos that I would just block my ex (which I should have done ages ago) and Emma and not have any contact with them.

I am going to tell them before I give them the car that if they take it on, the maintenance is their responsibility and will in no way fall upon me. If they feel they cannot afford that in the future I will just sell it. Thanks again**

Lurker, first time poster. Blah blah blah.

OK so, maybe about 3 or 4 years ago my parents had to give up their car, it needed a lot of repairs and they couldn't afford to pay the large sum or buy another vehicle.

I recently started driving in Nov 18, bought a reletively cheap car for myself with the intention of keeping it for around a year and then buying myself something slightly better when I had more driving experience. I thought instead of keeping it and selling it for a small sum I would give it to my parents as a nice gesture, it would be a lot more convenient for them to get shopping and for my dad to get to work, so I offered it to them and they said yes!

Here's the issue, my parents are horrible with money and my mother doesn't work. She's had a lot of jobs but always leaves for various excuses and it doesn't look like she will be getting one anytime soon (I think my dad has basically given up on hassling her to get one). Money is always tight with them, so my worry is that if I give them this car that when it needs work done they will ask me for help to pay for repairs. The thing is, I wouldn't mind that but I know that this will turn out to be a payment plan over a number of months e.g £20 a month until they're all paid up and by then they will probably need something else done to the car. I can definitely afford to help them out but I can't afford to get my money back in dribbles.

My boyfriend has told me I should give them the car and make it clear that if I give them it that I cannot help them out financially with repairs etc, however I don't know if that would just put them in more financial burden when the time comes.
They did say that If it came down to it and I'd prefer to sell the car that they would understand, however I feel guilty grabbing something away that I have already offered to them.

So WIBTA if I told my parents I couldn't help them financially with this car?

Also if there is any other information that you'd like to know, please say. Like I said this is my first time posting."	No A-holes here	0	0

c63l4c	2019-06-27 09:51:28	aitasshole	WIBTA for kicking out my roommate and close friend of 15 years?	"Throwaway account just in case. 

My roommate and I have been friends for almost 15 years (since elementary school). We recently decided to be roommates and have been living in an apartment together for about a year. For the most part I don’t mind living together and we’re still okay friends, but she does some things that bother me, and I wonder if it would ruin our friendship if I asked her to find a new place to live.

1) When she gets stressed, the kitchen and living room become a nightmare.
We’re both students, so around midterm and finals season she barely sleeps, leaves papers lying around, and doesn’t wash her dishes after she eats.

2) She rarely participates in household chores.
I find that I’m almost always the one taking out the trash in both the living room and bathroom, and I’m always the one to clean up the kitchen after it gets super dirty from cooking, despite the fact that she cooks way more than me. She leaves her Trader Joe’s bags lying in the living room so we can use them as recycling bins, but then leaves it to me to actually take out the recycling even though the chute is just across the hall. 

3) The biggest reason: She sets unreasonable alarms and then refuses to wake up.
Being the stressed student that she is, she tries to power nap between study sessions but fails miserably. She’s hit snooze on 2am alarms and continually hit it at 10 minute intervals until 8am when she has to leave, and I’m kept awake the entire time because the sound is that triggering iPhone one that everyone knows and hates. I hit snooze plenty of times, as does everyone, but to keep snoozing for 6 hours straight is just ridiculous to me and drives me insane. 

4) More of a selfish reason, but I play a lot of video games and can’t call my friends or stream when she’s around. 
My roommate takes frequent naps (an annoying thing within itself) which makes it hard for me to talk or be loud to any extent. I generally refrain from streaming when she’s home, but I want to make a bigger hobby out of it and feel restricted by her being there. 

Moving out myself isn’t an option for reasons. I’ve talked to her about points 1-3 already so she’s aware of them, yet I haven’t seen any change. I’m also not the best roommate either, so it’s not like I expect stellar performance on her part either, I just feel like the points I listed are reasonable enough. In fact, I’m writing this as her alarm blares after another night of being kept awake. Is it unfair of me to ask her to find a new place? WIBTA for not putting up with it because she’s my friend and because I’m not the perfect roommate either?

EDIT: I guess it was an important note that I can’t move out because the apartment’s under my and my dad’s name. She technically rents from my dad and so moving out myself would be extremely impractical."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c63kt0	2019-06-27 09:50:17	khii	AITA for wanting to use the garage in a place i lease?	"Situation: i have the sole lease on a house. I leased it and then found two flatmates. They pay what i deemed to be market rent and i pay the leftover (i pay the most, recently absorbed a small rent increase as i didn't want to mess with their rent, and also have the master bedroom/ensuite - they share the main bathroom that i don't set foot in). We split utilities equally. The house has a single garage. When i moved in i didn't have a car and told them they could use it. No one was interested and it ended up being used for storage/crap/turned into a giant mess. The laundry is at the front of it and I occasionally used it to work out in but no one else used it for anything except laundry. 

A year later i bought a car. I spent some time cleaning up the garage and found a lot of stuff that somehow didn't belong to any of us, rubbish, etc. I stacked my boxes at the side of the garage so i could use it for my car. I didn't move anyone's things out of the garage except my own. One of my flatmates then stated unequivocally that they didn't want the garage to ever have a car in it, and that they wouldn't have moved in a year ago if the garage was being used to put a car in. I know they also want to store a motorbike they're going to get in the garage, but they claim the motorbike isn't the issue and that they think it's very unfair if the garage is used for a car because it takes up most of the garage space, preventing anyone else from using it for other things. The garage is wider than a single but much narrower than a double. From my perspective, no one has used it in a year and I am the sole leaseholder and since I bear the risks that come with that (eg i am locked in for a year at a time but my flatmates can leave with 1 month notice) i would like to use the parking space. The other flatmate doesn't really care at all. AITA?

ETA: i was always clear that if someone wanted to put a car in the garage they could, no one did (they own cars but park them on the street because they couldn't be bothered with the garage). I own all the appliances furniture TV PS4 etc in the living areas and have always said everyone can use these as they want. This is the only time I've tried to stake a ""claim"" over what is technically a common area, albeit one that no one uses."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c63kj8	2019-06-27 09:49:14	themedstar	AITA: GF Mad because I did not send her a card for her Call-the-Bar ceremony	"So I am in a long distance relationship. My GF is in Canada while I'm in the one of the southern part of US pursuing my residency. GF is a lawyer and just got called to the bar a day ago. GF is pampered - difference of 10 years between her and her older sister and was born when her parents were on the older side and well settled. 

Since 08/2018 she has been articling in Canada (ON) while simultaneously studying for the Bar when she would get home. I have been very supportive of her throughout this as school/studying stress her out quite a bit (although she does it fine, just stresses herself out). Generally would say whatever I could to motivate her to keep studying as she would stress about the ""What if I fail?"" 

Ended up failing ½ exams in late 2018 and really shook her confidence and self esteem. Would listen to her vent but would continue to push to her work hard. Fast forward to 04/2019 and she re-wrote the remaining exam and passed it so getting called in 06/2019. I was incredibly happy to see her finally get to this point after knowing how much she struggled the past year. 

She has wanted me to be there for her ceremony alongside her parents but being in a residency program and on nights currently (8 pm to 10 am shifts for two weeks preceding her ceremony) there was no way I was going to make it. Asked her to take lots of pictures to share with me. 

A little bit about me: am from Canada as well but went to medical school abroad right after high school. Parents are generation immigrants and saw them work real hard to now to go point of relative comfort and pay for my medical school and brother’s as well. I am exactly what you call the opposite of pampered. Never gotten any any gifts, parties or even cards as such for any of my milestone in life (HS grad, med school grad, getting into residency finally). And neither do I care for these because for me, what truly made me happy was how proud I have made my parents 

On the eve of her ceremony, we video chat as usual. She asks me ""Be honest with me, did you think to send me a card even?"" Initially I became defensive that I have been on nights these last two weeks, but told her the truth, that no it did not occur to me. She told me she was hurt and immediately hung off. Texted me later she is scared that It never even occurred to me. To me the card represents acknowledgement of her big day. But I have been constantly doing that since her exam results came out and told her how excited I was for her. So I don't see whats the big deal behind a stupid card. 

I texted her some encouraging words on the morning of her ceremony while driving home from night shift and got a passive ""Thanks"" 15 min later. Since then we haven't talked or texted each other. She has put up photos of her from the ceremony on instagram but not directly shared with me.

c63ilb	2019-06-27 09:41:49	gimmepotatoooo	AITA for guilt tripping my friend about getting a job.	"Throwaway.

Sorry if this is too non-specific but...I have been working in my sector in some regard (work experience, unpaid/paid internships, jobs) for about 8 years and have finally managed to get the role I have been working towards within a respected organisation. My sector is notorious for needing to grind out a bunch of unpaid roles to even break into an entry level job, most of which will also ask for master level degrees, maybe even a second language.

Anyway, a friend of mine has recently been through some rough times in her personal life - abusive bf, deaths in her wider family and she also lost her job. During this time I have been her main support in working though the issues, calling the police and getting her to places of safety. If she calls me, I will pick up any time of day. I believe she would do the same for me. Things came to breaking point and she decided to leave the country for a bit and is staying with her aunt. Her aunt has been showering her with love - which is exactly what is needed now in my opinion.

I got a message from my friend yesterday saying how much she is loving life and enjoying her time with family and that her aunt is going to sort her out a job in...my sector in a very high ranking organisation. I was pretty speechless at first. My friend is very capable, however, she doesn't have any of the basic requirements for the role i.e. work experience, education etc. The job is purely through contacts. I told my friend that I was bothered about her gaining the job this way - I really did my best to not sound like a bellend, but I was pretty frustrated. She asked me why i was bothered and i tried to explain my point of view that she would essentially be taking the job away from someone who has put in the grind and would probably be better suited to the role. I think she may have thought that I wanted the job - however, whilst it is in my sector, it is not my field.

The last message I sent basically said, that I hope all goes well with the job, however, i was going to step back for little while. I got no reply.

There probably is a little jealousy - she comes from quite a privileged background and this isn't the first time she's been sorted a job through family contacts. But i feel more frustrated than anything else.

So guys, AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for the replies everyone. Think i needed the reality check. I've sent her a message apologising for being shit and for not supporting her. We've been through a lot together and have supported each other the whole way - I should have remembered that in the first instance."	Asshole	0	0

So my friend (really my coworker but we joke around a lot so a little closer than just coworkers) and I were messing around and they were pretending to be a stripper (we’ve been drinking and are at a bar with two other friends joking around) and I was encouraged by my coworker/friend and other acquaintance to pour water on them and without thinking much of it I splashed water on them 
(btw I am using them for a singular person bc I don’t know their preferred gender) and it was mostly ice and maybe a sip of water left in the small cup. But, as soon as I realized that they weren’t laughing along with me I rushed to grab napkins and try to dry them as best as I could. And although I did apologize and told them that I thought they were ok with it, they lashed out and called me a name and I tried my best to fix it, I was really petrified about what I did and for the next thirty minutes before we left I just hated myself for it. 
Before we did leave, however, they did look like they were over it, but I have a feeling that no matter how much I say I’m sorry it not going to fix anything. 
So am I the asshole for splashing water on my coworker?
TL;DR - I splashed a bit of water on a friend or coworker while we’ve been drinking and even though they encouraged me to do it, they still got pissed at me and made me feel awful about it, do you think that what I did was that bad and does it make me an asshole,?

c639s1	2019-06-27 09:09:46	religiousMILdilemma	AITA for stopping my kid saying grace at my MILs house?	"I’ve never seen eye to eye with my mother in law. She’s a typical southern church going type lady and she’s from an older generation AND comes from obnoxious wealth. None of these things are inherently bad in themselves but put together, you can see that she’s the type of woman that’s always got her own way. 

Recently we moved to be closer to her, my husband has taken a larger role in their family business so he wanted to be closer to everybody else. 

We have a 4 y/o baby who hasn’t seen much of my MIL and FIL over the years as we lived so far away but my mother in law has absolutely fallen in love with him. She is literally creepily obsessed and has remodeled half her home to be more kid friendly and has set up his own room there which I am strictly against him staying in and has literally put thousands away for his college already. It’s just over the top and unnecessary.

We are polite and friendly towards one another but I really dislike this woman and I don’t want her near my kid. 

She invited us around for a big over the top welcome home party a few nights ago and she invited all the extended family and friends, some of whom I’ve never even seen before, and expected my 4 y/o to stay up as the dinner was served at 8:00pm. 

She insisted that he sit next to her, and then just before dinner was served she bowed her head and clasped her hands together to say grace. She smiled at my son and said ‘shall we do it together?’ And because he doesn’t know any better he nodded yes. 

I leaned down and whispered in my sons ear that he could just watch this part and not partake, and he understood and was happy to just watch except when she noticed neither me or my son had put our hands together she completely ignored me and looked straight at my son and said ‘darling, were saying grace now, you ready to copy me?’  

I was absolutely furious and decided not to make a scene and told him to go ahead but my husband afterwards was disappointed in me and told me that I had caused a scene by trying to stop him in the first place. as far as I’m concerned our son doesn’t need to be saying grace or thanks to any deity, and I don’t want him around that religious mumbo jumbo.

my MIL is still continuing to be icy polite and I just hate it because I have nothing to gauge on whether she’s pissed off or not. AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0

My roommate smokes weed and also has quite a large collection of [prescribed]  prescription pills. [We live in a state where marijuana is legalized, if that’s of any importance]. Keep in mind, I also have my own well hidden prescriptions/ alcohol bottles etc that I keep in my own room because I know alcohol offends him. Anyways, I’ve always found it super frustrating that he litters our living room table+dinning room table with pill bottles, weed, pipes, ashtrays etc. because honestly, it’s embarrassing when company comes over. I have zero issue with any of it, I just think it’s silly to display it all so casually and unnecessarily. Beyond that- I recently got a rescue dog, who has a habit of getting into anything she can basically. That being the case, I’ve urged him to PLEASE keep all that in his room. He verbally complies but never actually moves them.  His defense is “but it’s legal! Who cares what company will think?”... completely missing my point. So today I took it upon myself to move all his drug stuff high on the living room shelf, out of my dogs reach. He flipped out when he came home, saying they aren’t in his “usual spots.” I reminded him that his “usual spots” shouldn’t be in our SHARED space. It’s been an awkward night ever since. So, AITA?

c638ws	2019-06-27 09:06:35	throwmeaway309475	AITA for wanting a coworker to sign a document in my stead	"So I started working for a vaccine manufacturing company a few months ago.  Specifically, I work in small scale and bulk cell culture.  One night we had to do a harvest on one of our 1500L tanks (which is something I had only done twice because it rarely falls on our shift).  Me and a coworker ""S"" were doing the harvest.  The standard operating procedure (SOP) had us write down the time of the harvest at the time we started the harvest.  Another coworker ""M"" happened to notice this and corrected us telling us that we are actually supposed to write down the time the harvest is complete.  M has been at the company for over a year and is the most senior person on the team (but not in a leadership position) and I have been appreciative of all the advice and guidance he has given me.  Without trying to start a fight, I explained to him why we wrote down the time we did and reference the SOP.  He explained that the SOP is sometimes not 100 percent accurate or updated.  So S decides to write down the time that M suggested and it is expected of me to sign behind him as a verifier.  I ask M if he could sign instead because he was the one making the call and I would feel more comfortable that way.  He proceed to, as I saw it, bully me to sign my name.  He started calling me an ""asshole"" for not signing it and saying I was ""stubborn"" and ""argumentative.""   I told him that I didn't want to argue and that it doesn't matter who signs it, as long as somebody does it.  Blatantly annoyed, he signed it and we moved on.  Later, I was printing out a batch report and M comes in and brings up the situation again.  I politely explained that I didn't want to argue about this and we could talk to our supervisor tomorrow when he's back. (supervisors father was in the hospital at the time).  M storms off once again calling me an asshole and that I was being stubborn.

TLDR- I didn't want to sign a GMP document that contained data that, to my knowledge, was inaccurate and felt better having the coworker who was making the call about the data sign it.  Attaching your name to documents is very serious where I work, and signing something you know is wrong could cost me my job.

&#x200B;

Just to clarify, I haven't had any other problems with M in my time working here.  He has been an excellent mentor and I believe he was having a rough night because our supervisor was in the hospital and it was a busy night.  I do actually agree with him that the SOP is not clear, and the time he wanted to write down is the correct time, I just didn't want to make that call with having very little experience.  I felt better having him sign it because he was the one making the call."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c62yyd	2019-06-27 08:27:43	dorky_dad77	AITA for not wanting to rebuild a relationship with my Mom after she threw us out in a time of need?	"Backstory: I left home at 19 for the military, and said it would only be 4 years. Well, it took 21 years to finally come back home, and by that time I had a wife and 3 kids. My job in the midwest was laying off, and the writing was on the wall for me, so i finally took the opportunity to relocate to a job back home, across the country, after not finding anything where we lived.

Prior to coming back home, i had asked my mom if we could stay with her temporarily while we found a house, and it was a resounding yes from her. We made the plans, and set out. The day i started driving, my sister announced she was leaving her husband and would be moving in with my mom, too, knowing that was already our planned destination. We thought it could work, but it didn't. 

My mother had her step-grandson living with her and her husband at the time, which i knew beforehand. I had asked well prior to moving if his binge-drinking and drug use could be curtailed, as I didnt want it around my kids. They promised it wouldn't be a problem.

Within a week of our arrival, he had already been hammered three times in front of my kids, who are all school age, and one morning he was strung out and incoherent. I asked my mom what she was going to do, and she said they had talked to him (yet again), and now he knew not to do that in front of my kids. I told her we couldn't stay in the house and be around that, and it blew up into an argument where she insisted this was a 'good learning opportunity' for my children. There was screaming, she verbally attacked my wife, it was just a mess, and she threw us out.

Now it's been a year. We semi-reconciled 6 months ago, but she told people things about the argument and my positions that weren't true, like I nearly became physical, which never happened, and she never apologized for attacking my wife or our marriage, or even my children, whom she insulted in front of them.

I can't find it in me to fully rebuild the relationship, even now, 12 months later. My wife is very forgiving, and says we should invite my mom over more, but I dont want to. I'd rather keep that distance, and keep it somewhat permanent.

I have been relatively successful and enjoy the job. I'm 30yo and I had originally extended my contract for 12 months on a 6yr enlistment in an attempt to commission to become a Doctor. 

Before the results for the commissioning program came out I also got orders to Germany.

Going to Germany would limit my ability to apply to commissioning programs and also require that I re-enlist, also taking pre-reqs for med school are pretty much out of the question as well. 

I have also been deployed to Afghanistan this whole time. I am eligible for a tax free re-enlistment bonus. All told it's around 25k of the devil's money. Everyone keeps telling me how I ""have"" to re-enlist for the benefits.

After getting declined by the commissioning program I was still on the fence about re-enlisting so I spoke with friends, family, as well as leadership who were all very encouraging. About that time my orders got cancelled because I hadn't obtained ""retainability"" (I hadn't acted fast enough so the Air Force projected that I was separating rather than taking the assignment they gave me).

In a knee jerk reaction I called up my leadership and told them I was upset that the orders got cancelled. They assured me that they would do their best to get everything walked back and that I could get that assignment to Germany. 

Now that I've thought about it Germany does nothing to help me reach my goal of becoming a Doctor. I also have no contractual guarantees I would even get the assignment, which I no longer want. I haven't signed any contract, but I'm getting alot of pressure to re-enlist because I've already asked so many high ranking people who helped me with the assignment issue.

c62wtz	2019-06-27 08:19:15	diarrheawatchdog	AITA for still requesting the $35 dog fee from watching a friend’s dog if I gave the dog back with little warning?	"I’m a college student and a close friend asked me to keep her grandmothers dog at my apartment (2 hours away). Her grandmother had an apartment but has dementia and needed to be put in a nursing home. My friends mom took the dog, but her house is leased and their landlord doesn’t allow pets. Since I go to school pretty close and they trust me, her mom asked if I could watch and care for the dog while they look for a house to buy, which should be sometime in the summer. 

I was originally told by my friend that the dog was about 5 or 6 and missing some teeth but the vet said it was normal. Okay, no big deal. She also said he sometimes barks but is basically “a cage dog” since the grandmother couldn’t care for him properly. Her mom also said they’d reimburse me if I have to pay a pet fee, which is $35 for my apartment. Turns out, they don’t have an age on him and he is older than 5 or 6. He would bark anytime I left or if I didn’t let him in my room at night. They gave me a bunch of puppy pads but never mentioned his frequent accidents. At first I thought we just had to get used to each other’s schedules, but he still had accidents, even had diarrhea multiple times on my carpet. My apartment smelled awful and I bought cleaning supplies for this. I had him from January to the beginning of May but for the first 2 months, I didn’t pay the pet fee. After the complex found out about the dog, I started paying $35 a month for his rent. I let her mom know, and she kept saying she’d Venmo me money. 

I texted her in the beginning of May asking for 3 months of his rent, she didn’t send money nor did she reply. I had meant to keep him for longer, but decided one weekend to bring him back because my work schedule was going to get busy for the summer and I didn’t have time to care for him. I texted my friend’s mom the day before apologizing for the short notice, but making sure it was okay to bring him back. She didn’t reply, so I had to go through my friend. I got the OK on bringing him back. 

Thing is, I had him for the beginning of May, so I paid the fee for that month, but brought him back the second weekend. When I gave the dog back, I asked my friend if her mom could send me the money for 3 months (first two months I didn’t pay. Rent was paid for March, April, and May.) Before I even brought him back I asked her mom for $105. After I brought him back, she had only sent me $70. Went through my friend again to ask about the remaining $35 and she said she’d ask, but her mom was always in a bad mood or mad at her. I told her I’d understand if she didn’t want to pay since it was in the beginning of the month and financially they’re not doing well, but I’m also not doing too hot financially and felt like it was only fair since they basically got 2 months free rent for him plus all of the stress and cleaning I’ve done from this dog. 

I feel like it’s been too long since I’ve given him back to ask again, but WIBTA if I asked for the $35 for May?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c62ua3	2019-06-27 08:09:39	crazyladyrachel	WIBTA if I get a new cat?	"Life for me over the last few months has been... bad. For a variety of reasons I dont want to go into.  I also have some pretty severe mental illness as well as physical disability requiring me to use a wheelchair at least part time. I, and my daughter, live with my mom because I need the help. June 12th I had minor surgery on my lady bits. Went well, aside from the unexpected polyps they found and removed. 4 days after my surgery my cat, who I have had since 2005 and was my special buddy had a stroke. We had to put him down as a mercy. I've kind of been spiraling since then. I thankfully already had a therapy session on the books the same week we had to put my cat down. My therapist recommended I get a replacement cat. I said I would think about it. Things have been getting worse, grief wise. 

 I finally went to the dr today to ask for antidepressants, which I got. My dr asked me if I was planning on getting a other cat. I told her I wanted to, but I didnt know how my mom would feel about it. My dr said that I would really benefit from getting another cat, like as an emotional support animal. She even wrote me an actual doctors note for my mom saying that my mental health would greatly benefit from getting a cat and that my mom could call if she had questions. When I got home from the Drs I told my mother what the dr said, and that I now had 2 licensed medical professionals telling me I should get a new cat. Like, they also were giving me phone numbers to local crisis lines and making me promise that if I started thinking certain thoughts I would either call or go to ER.

My mother absolutely does not want to get a new cat. She says that it's only been a little over a week. She doesnt want a new cat. I totally understand where shes coming from, because shes grieving too.  But I also have to think of my mental stability.

So.  WIBTA if I get a new cat when my mother doesnt want one?

Tldr: Cat of 14 years died. My therapist and dr told me to get new cat, even wrote me note saying I need new cat. My mom doesnt want new cat, says it's too soon


Edit/Update: had a long conversation with my mom after a close family friend approached us together with an offer of a free kitten, totally vaccinated, neutered etc. They're also giving us cat food, litter, a cat carrier, toys, basically everything he needs. My mom fell in love with him as soon as she saw his picture. Best yet, he wont be ready for pick up for a month or so, so it gives my mom the time to grieve.  We already decided on naming him Zumi."

&#x200B;

Quick backstory on the clickbaity title: I (f/31) have a brother (30) and, surprise, two parents. My family has never been close, even as a kid. While we never lacked anything (food, clothing, schooling), my parents were a bit abusive growing up, so establishing a positive emotional connection was difficult. I moved out when I was 18, never visited much. We keep in touch as in talk on the phone every few weeks and see each other about once a year. I call on their birthdays, they call on mine. I don't keep in touch with my brother at all as we have zero stuff in common. I text on his birthday, he usually forgets mine. That's our relationship. That all worked fine up until about four months ago.

&#x200B;

In December, I got engaged to my gf of five years. My parents know and like this girl. I texted them a picture of the ring, they said congrats, all good. In March, we sent out the save the dates, including one to my parents. In our next phone call after receiving it, they asked whether my brother was also invited. I said no, as we are keeping it to a minimum (30 people including us) and since my brother and I don't talk at all, he doesn't fall in that category. They said hm, ok and that was it. Or so I thought.

&#x200B;

Four days later, my mother calls me. She basically yelled and cursed at me for 15 minutes, telling me how much I suck for not inviting my brother, that I'm ruining the family, bla bla and that she won't be attending. I didn't really get to say anything and when she was done, I just sarcastically said ""well, if you're not coming that saves us some money"". This is pretty much me to the core, so a sarcastic snark from my side shouldn't have surprised her. Well apparently it did and she just hung up. This was my last conversation with her.

&#x200B;

Now to the WIBTA part. All of my family's birthdays are in June. I texted my father on his (we briefly spoke on the phone afterwards, nothing relevant), texted my brother on his (a two line conversation as usual) and now my mother's is coming up and I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I do feel it's a bit petty to just ignore her birthday, on the other hand, she said some awful things to me, apparently expects ME to apologize (according to my father) and I really don't want to be the person to break the silence even though she fucked up. My gf agrees with me, however I've seen some pretty insightful responses on this sub so I thought I'd also give it a shot.

c62o2g	2019-06-27 07:45:52	Aurora_96	AITA for expecting/requesting my food to be prepared and served vegetarian?	"I have been a vegetarian for over 2.5 years. For a while I have noticed I have become very sensitive to meat/fish. For example, I notice when my food has been touched by meaty hands or gloves. For some reason, it could make me feel sick and I could end up vomiting (I don't know why.. other vegetarians aren't bothered by this reaction at all). My bf is not a vegetarian, but he respects my diet/lifestyle and when we cook he luckily doesn't mind using 2 separate pans and such things when he chooses to eat meat. 

Now I have noticed that when we're eating out, the place mentions in their menu which foods are vegetarian, which is fantastic! However, I notice that a lot of foods are still not prepared/served in a vegetarian way. Some examples:

- When we go to a snack bar, the snack bar has a list of deep fried snacks that are vegetarian. However, last time we were there I saw the vegetarian snacks were fried in the same oil as meaty snacks. I approached the lady behind the counter and requested my food to be prepared in ""clean"" oil (read: oil that hasn't touched meat). Luckily that wasn't a problem. 

- I absolutely love sushi, so for my b-day my boyfriend was so sweet to take me to a sushi restaurant. However, my bf is not a vegetarian - which I don't mind at all - so he orders sushi with meat and fish. When the sushi was served, I saw my supposedly vegetarian sushi, was covered in the sauce of and touching the not vegetarian sushi (at the meat/fish side). I requested for the vegetarian sushi to be served on a separate plate, but they said they wouldn't do so. Instead, they suggested to leave a distance between the veggie and meat/fish sushi, but this still wasn't consistently done. 

I sometimes feel like I'm bothering people when I request my food to be prepared and served in a vegetarian manner. Is it annoying for people to ask for a little more effort to prepare and serve my food the way I order it (= completely vegetarian, aka not having been touched by any meaty/fishy hands/gloves/pans/other foods/etc)? 

My intention is not to be the whiny customer whenever I go out and I really don't care if the person next to me eats meat/fish, but I just don't feel like getting sick after I've eaten out.

Edit: thank you all for your suggestions and feedback. I never really thought of visiting an exclusively vegetarian restaurant. So I did my research and unfortunately, there aren't any vegetarian restaurants (yet?) in the city where I live. Most restaurants do have vegetarian options and those are the places I go eat when eating out."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c62o0p	2019-06-27 07:45:40	phantomstrange	WIBTA if I reported a coworker to HR after a (rejected) date leaves me feeling like I'm in the Twilight Zone?	"Okay, relevant background. So I (30F) work at a nursing home and ask out a younger coworker (24F). Coworker says yes, we exchange numbers, talk on snapchat for a couple weeks. She makes up a few last minute excuses not to meet up after plans were made and eventually says she's not actually interested. No big deal. I delete her phone number, uninstall snapchat (I had otherwise never used it), and unfriend her from fb. She got mad about being unfriended from fb and said she wants to be friends. To avoid work issues, I readd her. 

She offers to hang out on my birthday - today/yesterday (depending on time where you are). I message her to verify time and she says she's with another coworker but will ask if she wants to come too. But I never hear back from her. About an hour after we were originally going to meet up, I send her a message asking her why she even asked me to hangout. She responds immediately and says her dog had an emergency visit to the vet due to a broken leg. She always has an excuse and this time I was kinda salty so I called her a liar, crazy and told her to leave me alone. 

Turned out this time she wasn't lying, she sent a snap of the medication w the date and said to never talk to her again. Cool, it's over, right? Nope.

2 hours later she sends a snap of her and the other coworker talking shit about me and how I never had a chance, she never liked me, etc. But I'm feeling petty at this point and want to be left alone so I tell her I'm showing HR, she's harassing me. 

She freaks the fuck out. Tells me she makes 150% what her coworkers do because she reports to corporate and signed a contract and can't be reported to HR or her she and her mom (who does work for corporate) will be sued. 

Sounds stupid, but on my first day, the lady training me pointed at her and called her a ""corporate spy."" I didn't think anything of it until coworker confirmed it (and I had never mentioned it to her).

She offers to pay me not to tell, to please not ruin her life, and when I decline, offers to fuck me if I don't tell HR.

I freak the fuck out at this point. I'm not okay with where the conversation is leading or the implication that I would do something like that. I don't want to talk to her anymore, but she's losing her mind, begging me to pick her up, and for some dumbass reason I agreed. I guess I thought we could achieve a more reasonable conversationin person.

When I got there, she alternated between screaming, begging, and crying. Blamed me for the whole thing, accused me of wanting the residents at work to suffer because she reports changes that really do need made, like bad staff, poor conditions, etc. 

I can't work with her. This feels insane to me. I'll definitely be quitting on the spot first thing tomorrow.

But would I be the asshole if I reported this situation to HR as the reason why I'm quitting? I know I had some asshole moments (accusing her of lying about the dog) but I feel like this was too far.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the input. It was a bit of a mixed bag and a lot of people made some really good points. I'm inclined to think everyone sucks here. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks she's crazy (I thought maybe I was) and I can definitely see how my responses made a lot of things worse. I've never experienced anything like this, but I have certainly learned to behave more cautiously and to leave coworkers alone.

One thing I want to clarify: when I went to see her (imo, my biggest idiot moment), it was not to engage in sex. There was no sex, no consideration of it. In my original post, I mentioned how bothered I was by her suggestion and how the offer was super non-consensual and I did eventually get her to understand how inappropriate it was. But the subject of non-consensual sex had my post removed so I deleted that part and reposted. This is my biggest concern in the whole situation and continues to be, especially considering some people think she might to try to use it to accuse me of something.

" My Fiance and I have been together for 6 years, and have owned a Cat together for almost as long. We got him free from some admittedly sketchy people off of Kijiji when he was just a kitten and probably too young to have actually been separated from his Mother (We found out from our Vet when we went to get him fixed that he was actually younger than what we were told).

Possible due to this, or maybe just because it's his personality, but our cat has always had a bit of a...violent personality. As he got older he has often lashed out at us for seemingly no reason. He has left visible scars on my body from lashing out for no reason and other cats we've had since have been victim to his outbursts.

We had an unfixed female cat who he would try and mate with despite being fixed, being violent with her to the point where she would scream as if she was in agony from him biting the back of her neck (We eventually had to re-home her due to this plus the fact that she was pissing everywhere due to not being fixed). Our third cat, and currently the only other cat we have alongside our problem cat used to get along great with him. They would play fight when she was a kitten and he seemed to take her under his wing. They were inseparable. But lately, he has been attacking her too (She IS fixed) and will chase her down when she tries to run away from him until me or my Fiancee break it up. However, what has driven me to the edge is when it comes to our 2 YO Daughter.

My Daughter has received a lot of scratches from our male cat, some due to her getting careless around him (Pulling his tale and yanking on fur) but sometimes out of the blue he will just straight up claw her for just getting close. No warning or anything, just like how he is with my Fiancee and I. I'll come home from work and find a scratch on our Daughter, and when I ask my Fiancee, when she answers ""You don't want to know"" then I know for a fact that our cat got to her. I'm VERY protective of my Daughter and have screamed at the cat when this has happened due to my patience for him running thinner and thinner over the years of dealing with his behavior. I've tried to convince my Fiancee to give him up for adoption, for the sake of my sanity and more importantly, the safety of our daughter, but she is adamant that we keep him, simply because he was the first animal we ever owned together and she is scared that no one will take him due to his behavioral issues. She's says he may end up in a pound and be put down. But I just don't care anymore. I used to love this cat, but years of dealing with him attacking me, attacking out other pets and now attacking out daughter, I HATE him. I want him out of our lives for good. So, AITA?"

c62mgj	2019-06-27 07:39:46		AITA for calling the cops on a mom at my daycare center and having a false alarm?	"I got a new job at a daycare center about three weeks ago. The kids and employees are wonderful and I genuinely enjoy going to work. The main issue that the center has involves the parents. The majority of children there aren’t in their parents custody, have been in foster care, or have parents in prison. They have it very rough. That being said, the employees really stress watching out for bad behavior amongst the parents. 

Tonight was the first night I’ve closed at the center. Everything was going smoothly with each kid until a mom who is notorious for having issues with the center pulled in to get her kids, but never came in the building. 

I was working with a girl who has been there for years, I’ll call her Jess, and about fifteen minutes after the mom arrived, but still hadn’t come in from her car to pick up her children I asked her why ____ and _____’s Mom was just sitting out there. Jess said that she was probably smoking pot. Apparently it isn’t uncommon among parents there. 

About five minutes later I ran out to my car and I thought that I smelled pot. The mom’s car had all windows rolled down and the front passenger side door was open and the mom’s boyfriend was in the front seat with her. 

I told Jess about the smell and we called our manager who told us to go talk to the mom and see what was going on. I told Jess I would go, and I politely asked the mom when she was coming just because her kids had seen her from the window and were asking. (This was about 50 minutes after she arrived) She was laying down in the front seat, was clearly out of it, and said she was getting ready to come in. 

We called the cops, because legally we can’t send a kid home with a parent who’s intoxicated, especially when they’re driving. When the cops came in they said that she seemed completely normal, and when she came in to talk with us she was acting totally differently. The kids went home and the officer said she could have been smoking but they were airing the car so even if they were he couldn’t smell anything. 

The mom had also clearly lied to the officer at least twice because she said that she doesn’t smoke, drink, or do drugs, when our manager said she smells like pot at least once a week at drop off. She also said that she was only in the car for twenty minutes when we had time stamps on our security cameras that showed otherwise. 

I feel so guilty that I had the cops called because it was my opinion on the mom that was our main decision factor. It’s 3 am right now and I’m still feeling so guilty that I caused so much trouble, so AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c62lre	2019-06-27 07:37:14	asshole_cbd	AITA for reporting a marijuana-related business when I am also their customer?	"I work at a bank in a state where marijuana is legal. It is still federally illegal, and our federally regulated and insured bank can be held liable by the government if we bank marijuana businesses. We have an issue with a lot of marijuana businesses lying about the nature of their business to open accounts, as if we aren't going to notice their large deposits of fragrant $20's. If we suspect that a business might be pot related, we fill out a report and back office investigates.

A while back we had a guy who started making suspicious deposits into his LLC's account. When we googled the business name, the second result was the state's list of businesses that are licensed to operate dispensaries. I filled out a report, and the bank protection department investigated and closed them out. Not long after, we noticed that he was making similar deposits into a payroll business's account, which might be okay or might be a risk, so I made another report. So I've reported this guy twice.

I have a history of anxiety and depression, and early this year my anxiety went out of control. I stopped sleeping more than 4 hours a night. Strangely I was still functional at work, and then came home every night and fell apart. An appointment at a psych was over a month out. I was self-medicating with alcohol and fighting urges to harm myself. I said, ""Fuck it, I have to do something,"" and decided to try CBD. CBD changed my life. I have one CBD gummy a day and all of the physically distressing symptoms of anxiety are gone, and I can function like a normal human being. It has none of the side effects I disliked from when I was on benzos. 

My bank's drug policy specifically forbids the use of all drugs, including marijuana. CBD is federally legal (I see it in ads from Bed, Bath, and Beyond for Christ's sake) but I feel like it's still in a grey area in that sense. I have not reached out to HR to clarify. I feel like there is no way to say, ""Hey, can we use CBD products? Asking for a friend,"" without making it obvious that I am using CBD products. The product I get comes from a dispensary and the label shows that it has been tested and has 0% THC content. Still, I have a feeling that using CBD is not obeying the spirit of our policy, and just quietly not mentioning it isn't really that different than what our pot businesses are doing.

The dispensary whose account we got closed is close to me and runs a weekly special on my CBD. CBD isn't cheap, and it's not like I can bill my health insurance for it, so I have been getting my CBD there. A couple of weeks ago I went in and the owner was actually there and we both awkwardly avoided eye contact while I made my purchase. It was right after I made the report about his payroll deposits. Admittedly my bank isn't going to be found federally liable for my personal CBD use the way they could for this guy's marijuana account.

I was thinking about making a trip to Portugal with a friend of mine in October of this year. This would be a little over a month after my fiancé and I get married.

We had planned to go to SE Asia over winter break for our honeymoon so I figured she wouldn’t have an issue if I went on a trip beforehand but apparently it’s a bigger issue than I thought it would be. I brought it up today and she is not happy. She states she just doesn’t want me to go on a trip without her right after we get married. She admits if it was a week before the wedding, she wouldn’t care but the fact that it’s after bothers her. I’m trying to see her side of it and I get the perception is a bit odd but I don’t see anything wrong with it ultimately. I feel as if it’s a bit selfish, I guess, to prevent me from doing anything “big” until we go on our honeymoon. AITA here?"	Asshole	1	0

c62k0g	2019-06-27 07:31:01		"AITA for ""banning"" someone my roommate wants to bring over?"	" 

So I’ll try to keep this brief. Recently, my girlfriend of 3 years dumped me. However, we still live together and, for reasons I’d rather not get into, we probably will have to for the next year (yeah, I know). After she dumped me, she immediately began sleeping with a (now former) mutual friend. Needless to say, I did not take this news well. 

Since we both have to figure out a way to live with each other, I politely asked her that she not bring her new bf to our home. Last weekend, I left to visit my family for 3-4 days. After I came back, I offhandedly asked her whether she brought him over when I wasn’t around, fully expecting a solid “no.” She said that “for the most part, yes.” I was thrown by this, and after asking her more, I found out that she brought him inside to “watch TV” once. This pissed me off. I asked her why she thought that was okay, since she did not hesitate to agree the first time. Her reasoning was that, since they weren’t fucking here, that meant it was okay. I told her that I simply don’t want him in my house. He makes me uncomfortable and I don’t want to see him; since it is still my apartment as well as hers I would hope she would respect my request. I added that if there was one of my people she wasn’t okay with bringing over, then I wouldn’t. 

Previously, she had no problem with me hooking up with other girls, I assumed because she was done dating me and didn’t care what I was up to. My issue isn’t so much that she brought someone over, but that she brought her boyfriend, who I *specifically asked* *her* not to invite. I made it clear that I don’t give a shit if she brings *literally any other person* over. She agreed not to bring him anymore, but asked that I not bring the girls I’m hooking up with here, either. I don’t really have a problem with this. It’s a mild inconvenience, but not a big deal. According to her, the only reason she doesn’t want me to bring girls here anymore is because she is “petty enough” to ask me not to solely because that’s what I asked of her. Whatever. Thing is, any time she wants to hang out with her bf (so, most of the time), she has to walk to his place, because he can’t drive and she usually wants to drink. This means that she’s going there and back, sometimes late at night, and alone. I don’t feel like that is my problem, although I could see the responsibility coming to me if she gets murdered or something. So, am I the asshole here? If so, what is a reasonable compromise?

c62iwf	2019-06-27 07:26:58	froaway200	WIBTA for turning down being a maid of honor and not attending my sister’s wedding?	"Throwaway etc.

My sister and I have always had ups and downs in our relationship. We come from a narcissistic family and she’s always been my Narcmom’s golden child lap dog. This caused most of our issues as she they would gang up on me and treat me like shit. I moved to a different country 7 years ago and kind of gave up on trying to have a sister since her approach to communicating with me was quote “out of sight out of mind.”

Last year I moved back “home” and actually lived with my sister during a difficult time, and things were improving. I finally felt like I had a sister. Things were great until my mom pulled some of her classic shit and succeeded in putting my sister against me for nothing. The banned me from family holidays, the last ones I would be able to have with them before moving back abroad. I was so hurt. I haven’t talked to either of them since, until my sister invites me to be her bridesmaid at her upcoming wedding.

I was shocked and honestly touched until I realized that more than anything, this is a superficial invite so that she doesn’t look like that girl who’s sister isn’t at her wedding. She doesn’t want to “work” on our issues, and instead wants us to put the past behind us and move on. I’m not being petty- I’ve suffered so much abuse at her and my mom’s hands that “just moving on” is not an option. I’d love to have a real relationship with both of them, but they refuse to own any of their shit, or apologize to me. Like I said, it’s a superficial invite to make her look good, and I think that’s tacky and tone deaf.

Part of me doesn’t want to miss her wedding because I don’t want to regret not going in the future, and I don’t want to be the asshole sister that doesn’t come to her sisters wedding. But being her maid of honor means doting on her all day and ultimately putting on an embarrassing front for the duration of her festivities which I’m sure she’ll derive some sick pleasure from. I’d be on edge all day as not to slip up and offend her in ANY WAY. (she literally looks for things to be offended by, and I’m scared the slightest misstep and I’ll have “ruined her special day”.

I also live abroad on a tight budget, so I would have to take off work, pay for plane tickets and stay with my family who I cannot stand through all of this. I feel damned if I do and damned if I don’t.

c62fj9	2019-06-27 07:15:39	EconomyAdeptness	AITA for accidentally telling a guy how hot his sister is?	"Few months ago I befriended a Chinese guy, I'd often see him at our gym doing weightlifting type exercises and since it's quite small and we only have one barbell we often shared that one. We also spent more time hanging out, also sometimes going drinking. 

One time we got talking about girls and he said that he liked white girls better because they got bigger tits than Chinese girls who are mostly washboards (I'm just quoting him here). I told him I actually sort of thought the opposite and that Chinese but also Korean and Japanese girls were often really cute. I mentioned how there's a really sweet Chinese girl in one of my classes, I also mentioned some of the good things about her looks, but I wasn't sure how to get to know her. So he tells me that he'll help me out and that I should just take him there the next time with me, he'd chat her up and help me get a chance to get to know her.

So next time we go there I subtly point her out to him so he knows who I meant. His reaction was a bit weird though. A bit later he asks me whether I'm playing a prank on him and that I know that she's his sister (one year younger), right? I told him that I didn't and whether he was joking. But apparently he was serious and he even told me that I should stay away from her.

c62f14	2019-06-27 07:13:50		AITA for not telling my girlfriend about a friend/coworker with whom I was formerly somewhat involved?	"Apologies if this is a common question, as I can imagine a few people have been in a similar situation. And sorry if this is quite long.

To rewind 5 years, I started a new job and met a coworker with whom I clicked instantly. She and I (I'm a dude btw) became very close friends very fast, and soon started spending a lot of time with each other. We are very similar people in many ways, and had the same group of friends, would drink and hang out after work, etc.

After about two years of close friendship, we did break a few romantic boundaries. We first hooked up when both drunk, and this continued to happen a handful of times afterward. To completely clarify, by hooking up I mean kissing, some touching, and on two occasions sleeping in the same bed - no actual sex whatsoever.

We did develop some feelings for each other, but we discussed this openly and concluded that a relationship would not work, partly because she was 5-6 years older than me and was seeking a bit more than I could provide at that stage in my life (and now frankly).

We agreed to continue being very close friends, and both happened to quit our company around the same time, roughly 2 years ago. We have since stayed in touch and seen each other a couple of times (we no longer live in the same country).

To catch up to present day - a year ago I met my girlfriend. She is amazing and I love her fully. But, I do still keep in touch with my friend/coworker. We speak on text/Skype about once a week or two weeks. This is not romantic at all, purely based on our long, close friendship. We went though a lot of rough times together, including her losing her mother which was traumatic for her. We have a genuine bond which I am not willing to break under any circumstance.

But I somehow feel bad for not telling my girlfriend the full story about her. We don't discuss our exes (which I believe is healthy). And I don't even know whether to consider this girl an ex. Certainly there was some emotional involvement in the past, but we were never truly a couple. I'm afraid that if I tell my girlfriend the details, she won't understand our complicated history and will insist I break off contact. I would understand that reaction and would possibly feel the same if the roles were reversed.

I don't want to lose either. What do I do here, and how should I handle this moving forward?"		1	0

But he is extremely offended that I would say this and thinks it means I value him less than my dog.

But my dog has been with me for 5 years now, there's no way I would ever give her up  just because someone asked me to. She is my family, and is very important to me.

Recently, many of my friends have been quitting this activity because of the negligence of our teacher, who has turned what used to be a fun activity into a painful and time-consuming chore.


Two of my closest friends have stated that they will be leaving this activity, but I’m unable to leave because of my position in this club. I’ve told them that I understand why they did it and completely support their decision to quit, as I feel the same about how much of a drag this activity has become. But on the inside, I’ve felt differently from what I’ve said - I know that for the duration of this activity, I’ll feel immensely lonely and have nearly nothing to look forward to. I’d always thought we’d end our last year together, but most of the time we spent together was through this activity, and I’m afraid that I’ll be miserably trapped in this activity for a number of hours a week.

I have nothing against gay people whatsoever. I have several gay family members and gay friends who I am very close with and this is not a homophobia issue. This is an issue with bitchophobia. 

Here’s the situation. My girlfriend is the sweetest girl in the world. She throws parties for people’s birthdays (keep in mind, we are broke college kids), shares her weed with all of her friends, cleans the apartment for all three of her roommates every week and would give you the shirt off of her back. She supports all of my dreams and ambitions and has been there for a lot of bad in my life. She is a ray of sunshine who lives her day to day life trying to bring positivity to the world. Hardly a bad bone in her body (except if I don’t share my food) (jk)

Enter her sorority sister / roommate.

A spoiled and entitled brat from California who has a warped view of the world. She gets fat money from her parents every week and she never misses the chance to brag about it, leaves their apartment a mess and blames my girlfriend, and neglected to do anything for her birthday, let alone even say happy birthday, and skipped her graduation to go to the rest of their friend groups graduations. Lately, she has ragged on my girlfriend for how she dresses, steals stuff like pipes and clothing from her room, and has spread rumors about my GF. 

Here’s the twist. This girl is my girlfriend’s little in a sorority and my girlfriend supported her through every major decision from joining the sorority and was the one to push this girl to run for president of the entire chapter (which she now is). Evidently, her becoming president of the sorority turned her into this power hungry bitch the last year and my girlfriend has been on the receiving end of her rage. My GF has given endless love and support to her over the course of three years for her to ultimately shit on my GF and treat her like garbage.

My girlfriend is too nice to say anything, but has spent countless nights crying over how she doesn’t understand why her own little would be so rude to her and forget about the friendship they once had.

As a protective boyfriend, I became incredibly angered at how this girl and her cronies have essentially driven my girlfriend to tears. But one night I had an idea. 

This girls mom is the definition of ultra conservative and hates gay people. With a Christian passion. And this girl has been sleeping around with a girl, despite her lying to her mother that she likes men. If she ever found out that her daughter not only sleeps with women, but lied to her about it, her world would get flipped upside down.

About a week ago, one of my younger friends (who is almost 15) was talking about how he was going to throw a party at his house while his parents were out of town. He mentioned that there would likely be weed and large amounts of alcohol at the party and around fifteen to twenty people there. 

The day after I found out about it, and day of the party I called his mom and told her about his plan and asked that she at least send someone over to check on him. 

His mom ended coming home early and now he is mad at me, as he had to call off the party before most of the people showed up and send the rest home.

He was recently dumped and quickly picked up another girlfriend and started hanging out with people that smoke weed and drink and I’m worrying that he may be using these as a coping mechanism instead of actually facing the problem. I do know for a fact he has smoked with them on two occasions. 

I think I’m trying to look out for him but he doesn’t see it the same way I do and refuses to talk to me after what I did.

c624y2	2019-06-27 06:40:26	coconutheadstan	AITA for not wanting to be friends anymore	"So I have been friends with this person for going on 10 years but it seems like our friendship is just going downhill and I’m not sure I want to be involved with her anymore. Here are a couple of the things that have been going on lately...

About a year ago she and I had planned to move into an apartment together. I was needing a place to live and we had been talking for a few months and finally decided on a place. She texts me a DAY before we were supposed to sign the lease and says she just doesn’t want to move anymore. I had been looking for months for a place two people could afford so this kinda left me high and dry without anywhere to go. 

Secondly, we work at the same place, and when we request days off, our bosses only approve a certain amount of people (2) to get the days. Well, a month before my birthday I requested it off and it was rejected. I complained to her about it and she admitted to taking that entire week off, knowing my birthday fell within it. This is also only two months after she requested another week off that fell during my boyfriends birthday. She had no actual plans for her vacation, so I didn’t think it was going to be too much of a problem to ask her to just cancel one day of her “vacation” so I could have my birthday off. Especially seeing as I have done this for her twice when she needed days that I had requested off. Instead she started accusing me of not caring about her and thinking that she didn’t deserve an uninterrupted week of sitting at home, and that I was just going to go out and drink anyway so my celebration didn’t matter. In the end, I worked on my birthday and never did anything because when you work nights, nothing is open when you get off work.

The last thing is really a bunch of smaller things combining into one problem. She has been making a lot of (IMO) bad decisions. In the last three months she has gone completely broke due to her own poor money management, gotten kicked out of her apartment, contracted an STI, threw away friends that have really helped her bc her bf doesn’t like them, and has gained a lot of weight despite already having a slew of weight related health problems. Now we have been friends for a really long time so of course I don’t like to see her doing badly. I always try to give advice in the nicest way possible and push her to do better but if I say anything negative about any decision she has made and don’t completely support her ruining her life I’m “attacking her” 

Honestly I’m not sure I can deal with her anymore, it’s becoming really draining on me, and I told her that we need some time apart and she ripped into me for not being there for her when she needs it most and throwing away 10 years of friendship. She does need people that care for her but I can’t even tell her my actual opinions anymore without being accused of being a bad friend.

c624u0	2019-06-27 06:40:02	TinCrocodile	AITA for telling a stranger at mini golf to ‘Fuck off’?	"My BF and I are on holidays and our hotel is right next door to mini golf. We had some spare time and decided to squeeze in a few holes. We go mini golfing whereever we travel. 

Context: We flew into town this morning after flying overnight and having only about 4 hours total sleep. Also, we are Australians, in Australia so telling someone to fuck off probably isnt as big a deal as it is in other countries/cultures.

About halfway through a round, I was reaching down to get my ball from the hole and a ball hit me in the back of the head. Thinking it was my boyfriend, I yelled out ‘What the fuck?!’ He looked at me with concern and then at the group on the hole ahead of us (4 guys, 1 girl). The guy was just standing there waiting for me to give his ball back, so said ‘What the fuck?!’ to him as well. The rest of the exchange went something like: 
Guy 1 (ball hitter): Can I have my ball back? 
Me: Have your fucking ball! (Threw his ball back at him, with admittedly more force than necessary)
Guy 2: Wow no need to overreact.
Me: Im not overreacting! He hit a fucking ball at me. And then didn’t say sorry!
Guy 1: You didn’t even give me a chance to say sorry.
Me: But you had time to ask for your ball back?
Guy 2: Maybe if you shut up he would have a chance to say sorry. 
Me: You can fuck off. Both of you can fuck off. 

By this point the whole room (indoor mini golf) was silent. But I was done with my tantrum. No one from their group had apologised by this point.

I went to the bathroom to cool off while my boyfriend went to the bar to get us drinks and to put some space between us and the other group. As I was walking away, I heard the girl of their group make a comment while looking at me which made the rest of their group look at me a scoff. I didnt hear what she said, just walked away. 

By the time I came out of the bathroom they were a hole ahead but left their coats at the start of the hole we were on. As they came to get them, they made comments like ‘No need to get angry, just getting my jacket.’ and ‘Dont worry, I wont ask for my ball back.’ I was fuming at this point, but kept my mouth shut. 

For the rest of the time we golfed, my boyfriend was completely cold and silent towards me so when we got back to the hotel, I asked what was wrong and he said I was being an asshole and ruined that mini golf for him. I thought I was just sticking up for myself, because normally Im quite reserved.

c624sl	2019-06-27 06:39:52	GingerEcho	AITA for cutting off a friendship after leading him on/WIBTA for not apologizing	"This happened a few years ago, however a mutual friend of ours recently gave me more insight to the other side of the story and is pushing me for an apology.

&#x200B;

To give context, I was 13 at the time and the other player in this story was a friend of mine. Let's call him, Carl.

&#x200B;

One day, Carl and I were playing a game together when all of a sudden, he confessed his love to me out of the blue. I really wasn't interested in him that way, however, I was scared of rejecting him, so I said, ""Ok"" and hoped that he might catch on to what I was implying because I was saying it in such a reluctant way. The next day, he had already told all his friends about our ""relationship"" and suddenly, a bunch of people I rarely talked to were coming up to me and talking about how cute we would be together. That night, I was already aggravated from all the unwanted attention and was trying to think of a way to let him down gently when I saw his friends joking about us getting married in a group chat. He responded by saying that I sucked his dick. I knew at the time that it was an obvious joke, but at that point, I was so irritated that I told him right there and then that I wasn't interested in him. I made up my mind that night to stop interacting with him. The next day, I told him directly that I didn't want to talk to him in the future. Whenever he tried to talk with me, I would either ignore him or tell him to fuck off. When he bothered me on Discord and Steam, I blocked him. 

&#x200B;

According to our mutual friend, from Carl's perspective, I had lead him on by accepting his confession and then ghosting him. The mutual friend continued to say that Carl only wanted to maintain our friendship and that I should apologize. At this point, it has been a couple years though. I felt as if the issue had been settled already and rejected his offer, however he has continued pushing the topic.

c6240y	2019-06-27 06:37:14	lorealashblonde	AITA for not helping this little kid?	"This literally is happening right now (also I'm on mobile so sorry if formatting is wrong).


So about 20 minutes ago I heard someone crying outside, and I went to my balcony to check what was wrong. It was a little boy in school uniform (looks about 5) and he was standing in the driveway to my apartment block all alone. I immediately asked him if he was okay, but he was crying so hard he couldn't answer. He came closer and I asked him if he was alone, and would he like me to come down and check on him? He nodded, so I immediately went downstairs.


When I got there, I saw a woman nearby who wasn't reacting at all but was looking at him. I asked him again if he was okay, and asked 'is that your mummy?' He nodded again, so I smiled at her and 'sorry, I saw your son crying from my balcony and just wanted to see if he was okay'. She gave me the dirtiest look in the world and said nothing. The kid is still crying, and I sort of backed away awkwardly.


I'm back up in my flat now and she has been yelling at him (I don't know what she's saying as she's not speaking English) and has also yanked his school bag off him and thrown it in a bin. As I write this, she is also dumping a bunch of toys in the bin. The kid keeps looking up at me helplessly and she is giving me the evil eye. 


I don't know what to do as I obviously have no idea about their situation, or why she's doing this, so I have done nothing. AITA for just watching? Should I do anything, and if so, what??

c621s1	2019-06-27 06:30:00		AITA for ending a 12 year friendship?	"I've been friends with this girl (We'll call her Ann) who used to be my cousins friend (we're both girls). My cousin had introduced us but they eventually fell out, nothing major, they just grew up and had clashing personalities.

Ann had been my partner in crime, my go-to-person, my ""sister"", for 12 years. We went through high school, college, and Uni together. (Not literally, she's 2 years older than me so we were there for each other but not actually going through it together.) My family knows her well, the whole shebang. 

In March, i got married. My husband and I didnt want a big wedding, so my parents threw the wedding for us instead, and shouldered the payment- inviting all their friends and relatives. Naturally, i asked Ann to be my Maid oh Honor/Bridesmaid, and she accepted.

Ann has a boyfriend who she's been dating for 9 years. He hasnt proposed or told his parents about her either, so with it being my parents event, they didnt want him there. He's not my nor my husbands friend, we don't like him, and has no actual tie to Ann or her family. 

Ann decided not to come for the wedding, a week before it, telling me through text. The reason was because her boyfriend waant invited, and she refused to go unless he was invited. 

I had three of my closest friends to be bridesmaids, but had no maid of honor at my wedding. As much as it hurt, i still had a ball at my wedding. She never congratulated me or contacted me after telling me she wasnt attending.

And the straw thay broke the camels back was- and i know this sounds trivial but- yesterday was my birthday, and she didnt wish me. She's never forgotten and is always one of the first people to wish me. Its my 25th so, to me at least, its a big deal, and she knows it.

I sent her a text to end the friendship, but i cant help but feel like i did something to wrong her. AITA?"		1	0
c620ka	2019-06-27 06:25:59	ternateal	WIBTA If I invited friends over to my house after they had already been invited elsewhere?	"So this Monday I shot out in a group chat with a bunch of my friends asking if they'd like to hang out this week at our beach. They all said it sounded fun, but there wasn't one day where everyone could make it.

I held out on suggesting this Friday because one of my close pals couldn't make it, but I thought Friday would be optimal because weather looked good and most people could come.

Now roll around to this morning when one of my friends (who was in the original group chat) made a separate group chat with a lot of the same people except for two of my closest friends, inviting us over to his house this very Friday night.

He has excluded my friends before in situations like this and I get its his place, it's up to him, but it just comes across really scummy.

c6209z	2019-06-27 06:25:06		AITA for lying and telling my friend that her boyfriend called after sex	"At the beginning of sophomore year (last August) one of my best friends met a guy. She was infatuated pretty much from the start.  I'd known him for 5 years, and was extremely aware of his playboy ways. I tried to tell her as delicately as possible, but it was too far gone.  About a month after meeting, she was already giving him blowjobs and wouldn't listen to me or anyone else. They never exchanged phone numbers, so all communication, sexting, etc. happened over instagram. About a month 1/2 after school started, her parents had to take a trip to manage their second house on the other side of the US, so she came to stay at my house for 2 weeks. Her boyfriends parents were often out of the house, so after school she would usually go over to hang out with him and then bike to my house later. I told my mom the reason was an after school science club so she didn't get suspicious. As much as I disliked their relationship, I tried to be understanding. Then one day, she was later than usual. When she got back to my house, she collapsed on my bed and started gushing about the ""amazing first time"" she'd just had. I was surprised, and a little disgusted (he's dated 15+ girls and he's only 16, imagine the STD's). For the next 3 hours she talked about every detail of their encounter, and shamed me for never having had sex (I'm slightly older than her but not by much). She said I was ""wasting my life, and not fun, because sex was the only way people would ever like you"" (basically said that I'm hot, but no one likes me) which I thought was very harsh. I didn't judge her for having sex, and here she was shaming me for my lack of carnal knowledge and insulting my personality. She told me he promised to call her on MY home phone number at 10, and then fell asleep early. I stayed up and basically felt pretty shitty about what she said to me. Around 3 in the morning, she woke up crying about how he never called her. He hadn't, but I told her that the phone had rang, I picked it up, and I tried to wake her up, but she was asleep. She asked me if he had said anything about her at school (me and him are sorta friends) and I told her he said she was ""special and beautiful and he cared about her."" In reality, he called her a sex slut, but I didn't want her to freak out or hate me (she blames all her boy trouble on me), especially after she lost her virginity to him.

10 months later, they're still together. She says the reason she knew he was the one was because he called her ""special and beautiful."" She just told me this today, and I feel terrible. I feel like she deserves better, but I didn't want her to hate me or feel used."		1	0

c61ybq	2019-06-27 06:18:17	higaroth	AITA for being mad at my mum for posting a photo of me online on the last night of her birthday holiday?	"Me, mum and dad have taken a few days vacation a few hours away from home to celebrate mums birthday, which was yesterday and we had a great day. I never let her take photos of me (haven't most of my life) but under the promise that she wouldn't post any online and that I could delete any that I didn't like, I let her take photos of me. I didn't like any of them but I thought it would be a dick move of me to delete everything so I just left it.

I don't let her post photos of me cause I have huge insecurity issues about the way I look. I hate myself more whenever I see a photo of myself, and I've just gotten an email a few days ago confirming that I am now officially ""obese"". It's something I need to work on but the point is that I feel worse than ever about the way I look.

Anyway she had the misunderstanding that I didn't mind her putting up a photo of me on Facebook- I guess the fact I didn't delete any meant she thought it was okay despite that I kept saying constantly not to post. Anyway it seems she was genuinely misunderstanding. But now I'm upset because of it (especially because so many people have seen it and commented on it about my appearance which I can't fucking handle- I have these rules and restrictions about how I interact with online stuff to protect myself and my current sensitivities I haven't yet worked on, which included photos of me).

She's upset with me too because she says I never let her share anything about me- her only child- to other people, but I'm a very private person while she is extremely open. This includes photos (we've had numerous arguments about graduation photos on Facebook because she only wants to post the ones I'm uncomfortable with). I don't want her friends knowing much about me cause they're mostly judgemental or fake people, and I don't tell my own friends my issues let alone my mother's friends. It's the last night of this holiday and now she just wants go to bed and not enjoy as if ive ruined everything but I'm on the verge of tears and i do what I do for a reason, and I feel like my trust was really betrayed here. This really really isn't the first time she's done something like this, and it took me years to get her to stop. I made sure to say 10 times not to post online and she did it anyway, misunderstanding or not.

I'm genuinely unsure if I'm being an asshole in this situation, I feel like I'm being selfish and making everything about me, but I also feel like it's fair for me to be upset. Dad isn't getting that much involved and my friends would just tell me im in the right so I guess I need a third unbiased opinion.

Update: thanks for the messages! I've never done this kind of thing before but I'm glad I did, it allowed me to step outside my skin for a minute and see what's really happening. I've talked to her, told her I don't want my insecurities to dictate what she does so she can keep the photo up but ive asked her to delete the part that says I gave her permission to post it because I didn't."

People involved: my SO, befriended Lesbian couple 1 (LC1) and befriended lesbian couple 2 (LC2)

A few years ago I helped good friends (lesbian couple 1) with their wish to have kids. We did it 'the natuaral way' and got lucky very fast (they did undergo a light fertility treatement). They both got pregnant and adopted eachother kids (I gave away all my rights). Both kids are now 7y old (2,5 months in between). We are in good understanding and we still see eachother a lot.

&#x200B;

Now in the same small circle of friends there is another Lesbian couple (LC2) and they also would like to have kids. I'm willing to help out, but I don't know if I want to do it the natural way again. So.. WIBTA if I suggested AF or IVF? They kinda suggested they wanted to do the same thing like I did with LC1.

&#x200B;

My SO has no problems with it any way we go. We don't want kids of our own, but are willing to help out since we are kinda ""lucky"" to have no hassle to get kids. She also was  surrogate mother a few years ago for a cousin (Not the egg from my SO, she just carried the kid)."	No A-holes here	0	0

c61vpf	2019-06-27 06:09:29	m3owm1xx	AITA for taking down classroom decorations?	"TLDR: I'm a teacher leaving a school for a new teaching job and don't know if I should've taken down all the decorations I put up in the classroom.   


So, I genuinely don't know if I'm the asshole here. My husband says I'm not but I just want to hear others' opinions. I'm a teacher and have spent the last 2 years decking out my classroom with posters and putting a lot of effort into the appearance of my classroom.   


Anyways, school is almost over and the students are doing activities now and not having classes with me so I decided to take down all the decorations I put up. I personally made all of the decorations so it's not like school money was used for it. A couple of the decorations in my room were from a previous teacher and I kept them up because they looked semi-decent but now, they're falling apart and so I decided to take those down too. So, the room is basically a blank canvas at this point.  


I Googled if this is what I should do as this is my first school and don't really know what the etiquette is yet, and I found nothing that is relevant to the situation. It's all about ""holiday decorations"". The teacher before me left some up and I don't know if I should've left mine up too to make the room more welcoming for the next teacher.

c61szr	2019-06-27 06:00:28	CarefulDebt	AITA for telling my friend he needs to put more effort into working out?	"I started out with lifting weights about a year ago. Now personally I'm the kind of guy who likes to commit to something and try to get good results in it, whether that's learning for exams, a sport, or whatever. So I always made sure to train enough (at the beginning I did a full body barbell thrice a week program, later I switched to a PPL routine because I wanted to go more often since I actually quite enjoyed it). I also made sure to get enough sleep every day and to eat enough and the right kind of food.

After about six months my friend asked me whether he could go with me which I didn't mind at all, I thought it'd be nice to have someone to work out with. But to be honest his work ethic in that case just wasn't so great. He'd often skip days, just not follow the program we had agreed on correctly, and although I stressed the importance of sleep and diet those aren't really things he seemed to be too mindful about either. 

Now another six months later he's a bit pissed at me, I figure because I managed to make decent progress on my program and while I'm obviously not crazy muscular or anything people can tell I work out so thats a start, while he tbh, just didn't. And I don't say this to be mean, I just think he needs to rework his approach. 

But instead he often now just lashes out against me, e.g. claiming I held him back with the program and that someone told him doing every muscle group once a week would be better, or that it was easier for me to build muscle because of my bodytype and how it was much harder for him. I decided to be honest with him and told him that he skips too many days and also importantly he needs to increase his caloric intake, he's a pretty skinny guy so he probably just eats too little. But we actually got into a little fight over this (not literally) and he claimed I was making up stuff and that I was being a jerk to him, that he was already doing the best he could and wasn't at fault.

This particular sister moved to Florida about two years ago, married some military guy and popped out two kids, making her a mother of four. I haven't seen her in that long until recently. Our father got married this past weekend and she flew down to be here for it. 

She told me recently that she'd like to come over and see my place before she goes back. Problem is, I'm not comfortable with four kids and a man I don't know entering my home. 

I love my nieces and nephew - I just have a lot of animals, two of them being venomous. I haven't had any escapes or ""scares"" but that doesn't make me feel comfortable enough to justify young children who get into everything being here. I don't have the option of closing off my animals from them because I live in a basement with two rooms. The other room is nothing but storage and my cat's bedroom while I'm off working. There is no sitting furniture in there, no TV, just cat furniture and boxes. 

I want to tell her this but I'm having trouble finding a way to say it without offending her or taking it the wrong way. She knows about my animals and she may feel comfortable doing it but I don't. If anything were to happen, I'd be liable and heartbroken and to me, it's not worth the risk.

Despite this, people still heard, ofc. One girl sort of harshly whispered “shut up!!” I feel really bad about it honestly. I genuinely wasn’t thinking about how the cough would be distracting.

"I'm going to keep some details vague because  this is a throwaway for the usual reasons but basically my significant other (SO) and I have been together for 15+ years, have children together, share finances,  etc. the same as any married couple but we are not married. We have discussed it and decided it's not for us.

My MIL is quite involved in our lives, which is fine and for the most part we get along well. My biggest annoyance is that whenever I introduce her to someone as ''this is my mother-in-law, her name', she will laugh and say something like, 'well, not really, because she isn't married to my son'. It makes things unnecessarily awkward.

Recently, we all attended a social occasion where there were a number of people MIL had never met and she said it every. single. damn. time. After about the fifth time I spoke quite harshly and said she was being ridiculous with her comment, and she shot back saying it was inappropriate to present myself as married when I wasn't. She then left the event early and hasn't spoken to me in three weeks now. My SO has confirmed she's angry at me and has suggested I apologise so we can all move on. 

I don't see why it's such a big deal, since mother-in-law may not be technically correct but it's the simplest way to describe a relationship that qualifies in every other way except a marriage certificate.

c61osn	2019-06-27 05:46:19	insert_my_throwaway	WIBTA for maintaining minimal contact with my college friends over them not showing up to my graduation?	"I want to include all possible details, but here's the gist of it:

My college friend group are all from the same degree and same year: all freshman in 2013, supposed to graduate in 2017. Most did graduate in 2017, a few remaining in 2018, then only one in 2019, and others in future years. I'm the one who graduated in 2019, just last Saturday.

In 2017 and 2018 graduation, most who didn't graduate (already did or still haven't) still comes to congratulate those who are, take group pics, cheer and be happy together. Also, posters, banners, cupcakes, and gifts as a surprise. It seemed like tradition, and expectation was the surprise would get more extravagant each year.

My graduation this year and I was fine with not getting a surprise, though I hoped to, but at least I got to see them, right? The ceremony starts and they don't come. I'm crying during the program and there's still no word. I get my diploma and there's no cheer, except messages in our FB group chat (no wifi, so I turn my data on and off just to see messages coming in) that they're on their way, about 2 hours after the program started. I leave early (and told them as much) to avoid a mental breakdown in public (I've had a history) and go home where there's no wifi. Going on data as I'm about to sleep reveals that, late that night, they asked if they could see me and that one of them had a gift, but even if I had read it on time, I was long gone from the ceremony and it was still after it ended.

I hoped to see some messages in the next few days, but I didn't. Instead, I found them posting throwback pictures of the past few years' graduations and surprises thrown for them at the time. This whole thing has made me feeling forgotten and overlooked, and in retrospect I also feel taken advantage of because of all the times I did nice things for them and I don't feel even slightly appreciated.

I originally wanted to cut contact with them, since if I stayed I would just get more pissed and resentful, but I'm afraid that I'll regret it and I don't think I'm capable of that for them. What I'm planning on doing now is to just...not take the first step to reach out anymore. Put our group chat on mute, not volunteer information about myself, and not actively communicate with them without them reaching out to me first. And even then, I don't think I want to be as lighthearted and open towards them for a while.

My parents think I'm overreacting and that I shouldn't have expected much from them in the first place. But my point is that we're supposed to be friends, and if I can't expect support for something I supported them when it was their turn, then why call them my friends?

This is bothering me more than my family cares to listen to, so I'm turning to here for judgement and other perspectives. So, WIBTA to stop reaching out?"	Asshole	0	0

Young man holds the door for me and ends up holding it for a group of four women behind me. Once he's inside I motion for him to get in line in front of me and the lady behind me loses her mind. How dare I allow him to cut in front of them, it's so busy (and it was) they don't have time to wait for an extra order, etc.

We're super happy together, I love her loads and i'm under the impression she loves me the same amount. This isn't my first relationship. I've had a girlfriend for six years, then another one for a year and this is the 3rd one. She is slightly younger than me, so sometimes we're not always on the same page- but bottom line, we're in love and we want to give each other happiness. I've put a lot of things iv'e wanted to do on hold so we could be together- and i'm not complaining because sometimes sacrifices need to be made, I do believe its part of a healthy relationship.She is very sexual and likes having sex on a daily basis. I do too, but slightly less. I feel like an emotional connection doesn't have to revolve around sex. I feel that if I do things repeatedly on a regular basis they lose their value. I enjoy them less and I get bored. Nevertheless , I have sex with her almost daily, even when i'm not so enthusiastic about it.

Now I want to make it clear that I don't feel like i'm making a big sacrifice as I usually enjoy it too, but not always. I think I'm generally okay with it because I want her to be happy and satisfied.Recently an issue arose. She feels unsatisfied because when we do have sex, she doesn't reach an orgasm.Usually if she does reach an orgasm its because I went down on her before having sex or in the shower. Honestly? I make sure she reaches an orgasm at least once a week, and its terribly hard work which I do not enjoy at all. I do not like going down on girls, even if I love her dearly. It puts me off. I don't know why.She literally cries when she thinks about it not happening often, but on my end I feel like i'm doing the most I can. More than this would put me in a situation that i'm not comfortable with. She thinks i'm not attracted to her anymore or something and honestly i'm just confused?Am I an asshole for not giving more of myself even if I feel like I am?I do love her and I do want her to be happy, but I feel like there's a limit.

"A friend of mine from school had a really rough time this year and ended up in a rehab center for alcohol abuse. I honestly don’t know very much about her situation and don’t want to ask for fear of being nosy- I only met her this year so I don’t know if she’s had past issues with this. I know she has had a couple drinks since being out of rehab, but my other friends and I still try to discourage her. 

She just sent a message to me and two of my other friends asking if we wanted to go in on fake ids with her because she wants to get one to be able to go to 21+ shows. One of the other friends has already responded and is all for it, and the other hasn’t said anything. I’ve been looking to get a fake for some time- would it be wrong of me to get one with her? I don’t think that me dropping out of the group would stop her from doing anything, but I really really would hate to be enabling her at all. I don’t know her very deeply, even the girl who’s agreed to getting them was a roommate of hers and they’re very close. I just feel a little gross about the situation because I know how easy it can be to return to an addiction.

Edit: we’re all 19 and in college, we absolutely can get drinks without id’s. It’s more of a social thing for bars and shows etc"	Asshole	0	0
c61m85	2019-06-27 05:37:55	Violph	AITA for not inviting my cousin to hang out with me?	"

I am on a family vacation and I got a lot closer to one of my uncles kids, E who’s 7 yrs younger than me. She has a younger sister who is a yr younger , called O. I’m already very close to my other cousin who is a lot closer in age,L, who is my aunts kid.

I don’t really talk to O or E because I’m more than twice their ages. I don’t avoid them I just don’t initiate with them. I’m fine with them and we can have talk but we’re not close.

We all ended up sharing a room and ended up talking to each other. We got closer to E because she just showed a lot more interest in us and O just stayed quiet. Our conversations never involved inviting anyone, you just talk if you have something to say and I guess O had nothing to say or so I thought.

We start spending a lot more time with E . One night O moved her mattress from our room sleep with her parents and never came back to our room. I had no clue why but it was probably because she was bored with us because L and I basically played Game Pidgin the entire time.
 
We’ve been spending a lot of time with E and sometimes I casually talk to O if she’s around. If we happen to sit next to each other I’ll talk to her. I don’t think I ignored O in any way, came off as cold or mean she was just really quiet and didn’t like talking as much as I did so I thought she just wasn’t interested in us.

Yesterday we went to do something fu. Then I get a text from my mom and it basically said: Be nice to O and include her when me and L are together.

Have I been excluding or being mean to her? I get kind of emotional about this because this isn’t the first time O has gotten me and L looking like an asshole in front of the family but it was along time ago. I don’t like holding grudges and I try putting it behind me but all my grievances started popping into my mind.  We got back and I didn’t enjoy the boat trip thinking about what I did wrong. I tend to overthink, overreact, cry over everything, and period mood swings. I didn’t know what I did so I just cried.

I confront my mom and was told my uncle told her to tell us because he thinks we’re excluding O. That made me annoyed because I feel like they are old enough to decide what they want to do. If they want to talk to us, talk to us. O’s the more social one of the two so I feel like it’s more likely for her to not be shy. I don’t feel like it’s my job to “invite” people to join us. It’s not like anyone is stopping her, I never showed any hostility,so just join us if you want. I’ll comply but am I really doing something wrong. I feel like it isn’t exclusion if I don’t stop her from spending time with me and L. Both O and E  had an equal opportunity to bond with us and O just doesn’t seem interested so we didn’t talk as much. I’m not blaming O for this she’s just a kid. Am I the asshole for not inviting her to spend time with us from the beginning when she showed no interest in doing so. My family thinks I am."	No A-holes here	0	0

c61m1n	2019-06-27 05:37:19		AITA for wishing that my bf wouldn’t talk about our relationship issues to a certain mutual friend	"My bf moved to the country we live in around 3 years ago and I was one of the first friends that he made. We have been dating for a little more than 2 years now. Because I met and befriended him so early on and we became so close, he never really got a chance to make other close friends. I introduced him to my friend group and we all hung out together. 

He really clicked with one of the girls in my friend group (we’ll call her Jane). Jane and I were never very close and over the past year we’ve had lots of issues. I felt like she was very rude to me over petty things that didn’t need to be issues. She would often complain and trash talk about me to my bf and other friends. Because of this I pulled away from her more which only caused more issues. Although we have made up, I still feel wary of her and would rather her not know too much about my personal life. 

The thing is, Jane is basically the only person my bf feels ok confiding in besides me. And I get that he needs other people to talk to especially like when we fight because it sucks to have to hold everything in and not being able to express your frustrations to anyone else. I don’t want to be that controlling SO that’s like “you’re not allowed to have any friends except me” and I don’t want to tell him who he can or can’t talk to. I just feel so uncomfortable knowing that he’s ranting to her and telling her my bad points just because he’s frustrated. 

I have asked him if he would mind not talking to her about that stuff and he agreed to it, but I still feel really guilty for taking away what I guess is a support pillar for him. I wish that he would find someone else who knows me and sees both me and him as equal friends to confide in."	No A-holes here	1	0

I promised to help him make the weekly schedule because sometimes there's only two people running a shift on a weekday, which is basically impossible. he told me he's ""trying to save money on labor"" so he can bonus. 

I was also tasked with hiring new people. so he's basically giving me management jobs without paying me for it. 

I tried to apply for workers comp for a shoulder injury but he ""didn't have the form"" and I haven't heard from him since. I want to quit. But I can't get my chiro and doctor appointments covered if I quit... And I promised to help him with the store. 

I shouldn't be this invested in a summer job. but I can probably make more money driving for DoorDash or UberEats. I just...this job is wearing on me. Cause of my shoulder I can't really do more than 4 hours a day. 6 is pushing it and I'm continuously put on the schedule for 8hrs. 

Am I the ass if I quit? then file for workers comp? I don't know.

Edit:okay so, I know by posting this I might be biased because I want to quit. but it's good money, stable. and I don't have any other job to turn to. and I promised to help this store because I saw what it used to be. and I genuinely like helping customers and making them happy. so when I get yelled at by other kids at the store for putting 'too much' meat on a sub...idk guys.

c61l77	2019-06-27 05:34:27	SplasherSmasher	AITA for cheating and also helping others cheat in high school.	In light of another post I made earlier today on a different sub-reddit, I kinda wanna know what the general attitude towards cheating on high school tests in considered an asshole move here. Anyway, so in my junior year my and a couple friends decided to establish a cheating group in my school cause one of my mates was worried that he wasn’t going to make it to his dream school. Though I personally was always academically strong, I always hated school work and made a point to distant myself from the stereotypically intelligent workaholics. So long story short, we blew up hard and in our grad year we had 200+ members all helping each other on projects, and tests. In the end we did not get caught as a group (there were some individual casualties, nobody snitched) and overall we were hugely successful in increasing everyone’s grades and getting almost everyone into their first University choice. There are also strength in numbers and the fact there were so many of us made it very difficult for a nark to rat us out to teachers without major repercussions. The cheating ring still officially exists though it is only about half its original size (sister is part of it now). I understand that cheating is morally wrong but at a high school level it is also a victimless crime, and at the end of the day we made it clear that in university habits should probably be changed.

&#x200B;

I am about to be a senior in college at a university in Los Angeles. I am from Los Angeles so all my closest friends and family live very near to my university. I live near campus in a house with friends from college.

&#x200B;

Because I live very close, I have always visited my father on Saturday afternoons and Mother on Sunday afternoons (they are divorced). I've never really had weekends free to do fun things or go out with friends because I always spend time with my parents. I basically spend my whole Saturdays and Sundays with them. 

&#x200B;

Now that I am working full-time for the summer, thinking about my career goals, potentially having a girlfriend, and having limited time to spend with friends, I am thinking about spending less time with my family especially since life after graduation will be very difficult in terms of time management.

c61iih	2019-06-27 05:25:50	justathrowawayathies	WIBTA to force m wife and I to move?	"I currently live in a condo ( down payment and monthly mortgage paid by me) with my wife. We have been living here for 8 months, and like the freedom it gives. My father has offered to let my brother and I take over the mortgage for one of their home (they are struggling to pay for mortgage on multiple properties and will lose a great deal if sold right now); I want the walk-out basement for my wife and I to live in, as it will be more like having only a single close neighbor above instead of a whole building worth as is the situation now. The basement has more room (same number of bedroom as the condo, but bigger), a backyard, half of a 2-car garage, better school district, parking etc etc. BUT my wife finds it to be something she does not want. Fundamentally, she feels that us moving in would tie our finances to the rest of my family (which is a true statement), and she believes I should stay in the condo and save money for buying a house independently in the future. I want to build equity on two properties, and believe living at the home will be better. 

Now, she will not budge on the issue, and I am tempted to just tell her I can live in that house while she figures out what she wants to do, and we will just have to pay for both properties (which I can manage, but will impact what we can do month-to-month and saving for vacation etc) untill she pays a portion of the condo mortgage or moves into the house with me. We have separate accounts, and a shared account for pooling to pay for common things (this way fun money is separate). She works part-time right now, so she helps by paying 60% of groceries, her car insurance and gas ( we have one vehicle that she drives to work), and things here and there. I feel she does not really appreciate what owning 2 properties can mean for us in the long run (finding renters for the condo will not be too hard), and is really against the idea due to her anger towards my family's reliance on me to deal with their bad financial choices (which is justified). I think this may be an opportunity to move to a nicer neighborhood, build more equity, and have my brother as a close neighbor instead of bunch of strangers.

I (30f) was looking for some herbal enjoyment with my sister (20f) for our evening. I can only find larger quantities and my sis can find some 1g bags of green paint samples. 

Well her ex b/f or super on again off again boyfriend is the one that I end up asking. She kind of suggested I ask him and then when I was absolutely out of luck I asked her again, ""Hey is it ok, like for sure, if I ask your ex."" She said she was fine with it and I asked him, he even offered to give me a ride since I have no vehicle right now. 

He pulls up and comes in alone he does this all the time so we all just assume he is alone. He never said anything about coming with another person. 

I get out to the car assuming it's going to be his dad or he is driving someone else's car and low and behold it's a female.... I get in the back seat and he mumbles something about the girl being like family tells me her name, then proceeds to introduce me to her on a vaguely personal level. 

The girl wasn't offended by his remark about being ""family"" and they didn't flirt or hold hands they just chilled. We get to the homies house for my sis ex to hook it up.

I waited in the car with ol' girl. We barely talked but it definitely wasn't awkward. When the ex comes back we head home and he asks me to smoke with him. I was like ""hell yeah of course"".

They come into the garage and my sis comes out. I introduce the ladies not thinking a thing of it. All hell breaks loose at this point. 

Yelling, crying, storming off, angry texts and what Ultimately ends in the girl taking off after being threatened by my sister.

I totally agree that it was disrespectful of the ex to bring a current relationship around unannounced, to literally just cause drama. 

BUT WHAT THE HELL DID I DO? 

I haven't seen her this mad in a minute. My sister is super mad at me! Idk if it's that she really thinks I did it on purpose or if it was how I reacted? Idk I just can't  figure it out! 

I was a bit shocked she even cared because she got like super crazy upset?! She acted like she gave no cares about this dude and had been seeing other people herself! So I did tell her that I thought he was disrespectful but I didn't understand why she was that upset?

Honestly the couple are horrible together, she is miserable and so is he! I feel bad for them both when they try to make ""things work"" I mean their personalities just clash. My sis has known that I support her choices but still didn't think they were good together.

Their marriage ended because my dad lied about his sobriety (he’s an alcoholic) for years and cheated with multiple sex workers for a decade. My dad and I are not super close. We live in different cities. We see each other maybe 4 times a year and talk on the phone every few weeks. Despite him being a lying pos, he’s actually a pretty supportive dad and I value the limited relationship we have. 

He got a new gf and recently moved into her house. He told me she asked if he ever cheated on my mom and he said “yes, but I didn’t have sex with anyone” (not sure what she thinks he did?). He also hasn’t told her about being an alcoholic. I have encouraged him to be honest with her but he refuses. Eventually I got frustrated and told him not to talk to me about lying to people. I made it clear that I don’t support his actions and don’t want to be involved. I try to stay out of his business because he makes so many dumb decisions and trying to convince him to do the right thing is exhausting. I’m his kid, not his life coach. 

My mom found out about his new gf and is now pressuring me to tell this woman about the affairs and alcoholism. He is definitely still drinking and I’d be surprised if he wasn’t cheating on her. I feel bad for his new gf, I really do. But I really don't want to get involved in his bullshit. I’ve also only met her a couple times and I feel like it’s ok to prioritize my desire to maintain a distant relationship with my dad over the feelings of this woman that I hardly know. My plan is to tell my dad I don’t want to get to know her while he’s not being honest. This is not to get him to come clean, he won’t. It’s so that I can continue to stay out of it.

Neither of us make a lot of money as we’re both part time and she just recently got her job (March). Due to unfortunate circumstances with bills, car repairs, etc it has been delayed.

Last time it happened, she said that I'm not 'rebound material' (we were talking about my ex - who we suspect used me as a rebound). And I asked her to define rebound and she said 'conventionally attractive and stupid and has no depth'. 

At other times, she's said it as part of compliments - she'd overdo the non-physical compliments and make it look like she's with me for this whole list of secondary reasons. She'd always emphasize how she has an unconventional taste in men. (Like she does compliment my looks a lot too which is why I suspect I'm being petty.) This, to me, translates as ""I like you only because I'm retarded"" but I'm sure she means better.

The reason I decided to call her out tho was because she is super sensitive about her attractiveness and has been mad at me for petty stuff - implying she's less attractive than Scarlett Johansen; saying a specific photo of her was bad, etc.

So today my GF (24) and myself (25) had a huge fight over me venting to my mother a while back about shared responsibilities in our apartment.

A couple months ago we got in an initial argument over me basically doing all of the chores around the apartment while she would go lie down. I would ask for help and get little to none in return. Our relationship  didn't start off like this and it got to be too much.

My day would consist of working all day then coming home to cook a new meal every day because leftovers ""aren't for dinner."" I would have to do any dishes I created, wash and fold laundry, clean any messes, and on top of that if I didn't give her enough attention she would whine about that too. 

I tried everything from trying to do stuff together to not doing it until I couldn't stand to look at the mess. Nothing helped. 

She would blame it on her depression and anxiety. Meanwhile she would go out with friends and/or myself just about anytime it was offered or she wanted to.

In the mean time I would vent to my parents (divorced) about how stressed I was with all that was in front of me.

After our initial argument things got better and she started helping around the house more so the issue was basically resolved. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. My sister overheard my mother talking to her boyfriend about how she didn't like my girlfriend. My sister told my girlfriend and she asked why. I didn't remember venting to my mother at the time she asked so I told her I didn't know.

Today I was on the phone with my mother and she asked if I was still doing everything or if my GF was helping out and I told her she was. 

Later with my GF I told her I found out why my mother said what she did and chaos ensued.

Summarized version of our fight, I'm stupid for not understanding her, I'm selfish for not just doing everything, I don't care about her, I don't get how depression works, etc... She kept telling me how I ""know how important impressions are to her. And now hers is ruined"" even though they met before the argument.

I let her speak her mind during the argument and spoke up when left with a question.

Post fight I haven't talked much. I'm not sure I really want to.

I guess I take TV pretty seriously, most things we watch are things that I want them to see and i get offended when I look over and they are staring at their phone.

My SO had to go out of state for a trip for school and she didn't have any credit cards to put her expenses on. Since we had been dating for 3 years at this point I felt comfortable putting the charges on my cards with the promise that she would pay this back once she was able to.  I have texts from when we were planning this trip where she agreed to this plan if that counts for anything.

&#x200B;

I work full time own a home and all of the expenses that come with that.  She is going to school for her Masters and currently has only been working part time jobs when she can.  She also is a single mother from a previous relationship which shouldn't make much difference here.  I am not in any way going to be hurting for this money but it would be pretty nice to get it back since I would not have spent any of this had it not been for her needs.  I told her before we left that it would be about 1500 dollars that she would owe me for her share of the trip.  After I totaled everything up and subtracting my flight and half of the rental car it comes to 1874.  This does not include meals or any of the entertainment we enjoyed while we were gone since that was normal relationship type expenses. She already paid me 900 of this but every time I have tried to contact her about the rest of the money she has just made an excuse or ignored me completely.

c6163u	2019-06-27 04:47:56	BlizetteAlchemy	AITA for accidentally having my lender call my manager when she was planning a funeral?	" Sorry in advance for the format I'm on mobile.

So we've been trying to buy a home and we are in the final leg before closing. They always check in with your employer to make sure you are still currently employed. So they called my work and the manager was out and the owner was out. The owner pops in and out as he pleases. And the store manager the last I had been told over the weekend was out to care for her mother who had fallen recently. I hadn't been told anything else about the situation and was off the two prior days so even if some one told us, I wasn't present. So the lender stressed that she needed that verification TODAY for us to close at the end of the week. Since there was no one there she asked if I had my managers personal number and I gave to her. Which yes may have been a little stupid of me but at the time I didn't think anything of it. Turns out when I got to work the other employee told me the managers mother had passed away and I had the lender call her on the day she's planning her funeral. I feel like such scum but I didn't even know. So today I get a text from her because I left a note for her about scheduling and she told me I got a write up for the incident. I one hundred percent understand and accept it. Had I known she was making funeral preparations for her mother I would have never had them call her. I apologized and explained I didn't know until I got to work after they called her and I was very sorry and sorry for her loss. I think this is the worst fuck up I've done in a very long time. It's a mom and pop store and they seemed to like me there but the icing on the cake I have to go back Friday and look her in the eye after this and put in my two weeks notice as I got offered a better job. My husband also feels I should add that her personal number is on some business cards at our check out but I feel this isn't relevant.

After saying this, they stopped for about 10 minutes before proceeding to continue for another half an hour, by which point most other people in the room are awake, but no one else said anything to them unlike me.

I can tell she finds it annoying, but she’s never complained to me. Last week we were having a discussion and I told her that her mother reads her messages, after all we pay the phone bill so it’s our right to know what’s going on on her phone. She seemed to be very upset about this which obviously raised concern to me. We’ve also had many discussions about her and her boyfriend and their relationship. In these discussions she has never been forthcoming about sex and after her obvious discomfort with us reading her messages I thought that topic needed to be revisited. The other night she got in trouble so while my wife was yelling at her because of that she decided to ask if she was sexually active with her boyfriend. She said yes and is now being punished for not telling us that she had lost her virginity. 
Don’t get me wrong, my daughter is an honor roll student that organizes charity work for our church, it’s not that I don’t trust her. I just find it unacceptable for her to hide anything from us.

c60wur	2019-06-27 04:20:10	FlakyDelay	AITA for calling out my boyfriend because he disrespected his deceased uncle?	"My boyfriend's eldest uncle died two weeks ago, and my boyfriend absolutely hated him for his decision to convert to Islam. My boyfriend's family is Chinese Malaysian, and while Malaysia is a majority Muslim country, very few if any Chinese Malaysians are Muslim. Most are Buddhist and some are Christian or atheist (my boyfriend is an atheist). My boyfriend thinks his uncle joining the Muslim faith is a betrayal to the family and to the Chinese Malaysian people who have been discriminated against by conservative Muslims for years. For what it is worth, his uncle did become a much more conservative and maybe even a little bit self-righteous person after converting to Islam but he also chose to do more charity work for non-Muslims and actually built connections with Buddhist temples and Christian churches on community projects in his town. My boyfriend does not think this justifies what he sees as being a traitor

Now when his family was making funeral arrangements, my boyfriend was expected to go the funeral all the way in Malaysia. My boyfriend refused (which was okay with most of his family) but he angered some of his family members by referring to his uncle as ""it"" and calling his body a ""carcass"". His family are all educated in English so they know that that's not how you should normally refer to a person that has died. My boyfriend refused to apologize.

I didn't intervene during the Skype call when this conversation took place even though I was next to him, but I did tell him that it was unnecessary and rude to refer to a human being by those words. My boyfriend defended his actions saying that he does not want to respect a person that has shown no respect to him and to the rest of the family, and that he's glad his uncle is out of his life.

Was I wrong to call my boyfriend out like that? I feel like maybe I was unreasonable for not understanding his anger.

c60wm5	2019-06-27 04:19:24	bilsukuj	AITA for noise complaint against my hard of hearing neighbor?	"So, I live in a pretty old ""apartment building."" It's actually an old house that's been divided into apartments. Anyway, the walls are VERY thin. I deal with a fair amount of noise, and mostly it doesn't bother me. Plus, I'm sure my neighbors are sick of me watching the office 24/7. However, we're all pretty good about shutting up past like 10 p.m. About three months ago a new neighbor moved into the apartment that's directly under mine. When he first moved in he said he uses a hearing aide and its hard of hearing, and if he was being too loud just come and tell him. He talks pretty loudly on the phone, but that doesn't bother me because it's usually during the day. About a month ago he got a giant tv and a surround sound system and has started to BLAST his tv. And I mean, LOUD. It literally shakes my windows, especially on bass or when he's watching action movies. I usually can hear every word if he's watching a sitcom/etc. He also watches tv faaarrr into the night. I'm talking 4 a.m. and he's still watching tv. I stay up pretty late, but even more me it's been making it hard for me to sleep. 

I came to him like a week and a half after he got it and asked him really nicely if he'd mind turning the tv down a little bit after like 11 p.m. or 12 p.m. because that's when I need to start sleeping. i explained that i think my bedroom is above his living room and I'm getting most of the sound clear as day. He was pretty chill about it and turned it down... for that week. 

Since then it's been consistently super loud, where I'll know what he's watching, it'll shake my window, and it keeps me up. I'll text him when it's so loud I literally cannot ignore it/it shakes my bed, and it's like 50/50 whether he'll turn it down, or even turn it down enough that it makes a difference. It's gotten to the point where I'm texting him like 2-3 times a week because I work and I need to sleep. IF he turns it down he guilt trips the heck out of me and makes me feel super bad for asking. I do feel bad asking him to turn it down because I know he is hard of hearing/wears a hearing aide, but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask him to keep it quiet after like midnight. Am I the asshole? It's getting ridiculous. He's aware it's an issue and he just doesn't care. I get he can't hear, but I KNOW it's way louder than he needs it (it's movie theater loud and he can hear normal volume conversations), and past midnight he could use captions. 

The only reason why I've been hesitant to complain is because he's on parole, and I think it was pretty difficult for him to find a rental agency that would rent to him. I don't want him to get kicked out but I just wanna sleep!

However, we are both at the start of our careers and as such don't have the most stable finances. Add to this the fact that I recently had a medical condition that required us both to take some time off work, and we are more or less living paycheck to paycheck. But, I come from money and have always used that to buoy our situation (covering her rent if she's short, getting nice stuff for her or the house, paying our vet bills, etc.). Never the less, she is always stressed about money to the point of it making her physically anxious.

Today, she had planned on going thrift shopping (specifically only thrift shopping was mentioned. This is important) with a friend, but due to the aforementioned time off she didn't have much in her account. She said she would go and just not buy anything, but I know that this makes her feel left out and anxious. I offered to let her take my credit card, and she accepted. Later, she called me saying that she got a dress and was thinking of returning it. I told not to, thinking that she always stresses after almost any purchase. She also has some body image issues and frequently feels bad about her clothes which causes her more shopping stress. I assumed her desire to return the dress was related to this.

Later the same evening, I'm doing some banking online and notice my credit card statement is much larger than I anticipated. I check it and see that there is almost 100 dollars in charges from a couple of upscale clothing stores in town, and nothing from any thrift store.

Here's the thing. If she had told me that they had changed from thrift shopping to an upscale place, I would have told her to go for it! Like I said, I have the money to cover it, and I like it when she can feel good about getting something new that she wouldn't normally be able to afford. At the same time, I can't help but feel a little taken advantage of.  I don't want to make her feel guilty or return the clothes or feel bad every time she looks at them, but I want her to know that I don't feel great about the way the whole thing shook out.

c60tf0	2019-06-27 04:10:12	MyOtherAccount8719	WIBTA if I set up a gofundme for a vacation with my kids?	"Tl;dr: single dad. had to spend vacation fund on responsibilities, replenished fund, had emergencies spring up. Kids have earned a fun vacation. Co worker suggested setting up a gofundme. I'd feel like an asshole using it for a vacation when there are so many people with real problems (cancer,total loss,etc).


I've been told by friends and co workers that it's reasonable but I'm not sold.
Every year I try to take my kids on a vacation. Not because I want to spoil them, but because I wasn't fortunate enough to experience anything like a family vacation as a kid. I want my kids to grow up having had the opportunity to see the country and make  memories. 
2017:road trip through CO, WY, SD. We explored Denver, camped Yellowstone, and visited Mt Rushmore.
2018: went back to Denver for a weekend and then went to SF to visit family and see the Golden gate bridge, alcatraz, ocean, the full house house, etc.
 This year would be San Diego. zoo, safari park, sea world, museums, etc.
I had saved $3500 to pay for a vacation, but ended up having to use it to pay taxes, and something else that I can't remember at the moment, but I'm sure it was important.
I decided to sell my old jeep. Nothing special, but I could net enough money to fund the trip. That money ended up buying new clothes (I was letting my daughter help me do laundry and bleach looks a lot like detergent to a 10 year old), then an engine repair on my car that cost a good chunk, and lastly my dog had to have blood tests and x-rays due to unexplained weight loss (he's fine, it was due to chickens eating his food)
On top of that my daughter and I both needed new glasses (no vision insurance), and their mom impulsively quit her job so now I'm solely paying for the kids summer program.
My kids aren't spoiled but they're not deprived of much either.
I grew up without the luxury of vacations, or even going to the zoo. My mom (single mom) made good money but wasn't really wired to have kids. sister and I were left to entertain ourselves.
I love spending time with my kids as much as I can. They're good kids, don't get into trouble at school, they're in the top of their class (as much as elementary kids can be),polite, respectful, helpful, and I feel like they earn and deserve a vacation.
That being said, as someone who was raised without vacations or outings, I don't think it would be the end of the world if we missed a year.
I just know they'll be disappointed. They've been looking forward to it. (I don't promise them a vacation or tell them when or where it will be, they just know that we're eventually going on a vacation)
  Here's why I think I'd BTA for setting up a gofundme.
There's tons of gofundme pages for people with REAL problems. Cancer, Sick children, families that lost everything, etc. People in dire need of money to simply survive. It seems assholish to divert money from them to pay for a vacation."	Asshole	0	0

c60r9w	2019-06-27 04:03:34	Snow_KMTH	AITA for not liking to be called the rich kid?	"Hers the background. 
I am from a developing country and I could say my parents have a monthly income of what could be labeled as high income. We live in a heritage house (owner by my father and 4 other siblings so) to “look after” my two aunts who are  over 70 and another over 60. The house is a two story house with 5 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 2 living room (one for guest and another to chill)  on the first floor and 2 more “living space” on the second floor. So it is a fairly decent house. We also have a two story garage right beside the house and the plot is fenced in. Even with the two buildings there is enough space for 2 more cars to part if you don’t count the garage which fits 2 cars. So I would say it is a normal upper middle class family. 

But the issue is I never have money. I understand why my parents are frugal with it because I just graduated university and they have fully funded my degree abroad which is not cheep. And I’m forever grateful for it. They are also as saving up for my brother’s university cause he’ll be taking IGCSE in 2 years and be going to university too. But the issue is not with my parents. My parents are frugal with money because they have stuff to save up for. And thAts why I have to be careful of what I spend my money on too. That’s where I struggle the most. I am a Shopaholic. So every time I see something I want I want to get it and hates looking at the price tags just to make sure I can afford it. But these are all my want not my needs so I sound like an entitled brat but this is not the reason I’m asking AITA. I know how to handle all these and keep it to a minim to help my parents. 

My question is because I hate being called the rich kid. Because with all the savings I was forced to do, I never felt rich and I feel like the word “rich kid” is like making fun of my struggle as a shopaholic. This all started when I invited my friends from university for dinner at my home when they were visiting my country. One friend who is a guy knew how much I usually spend when I go shopping (even though I try to reduce my spending, I end up spending more that what most of the guy friends spend. I’ll not mention girls because most of my girlfriends would spend the same amount or even more) and now, when he came to my house he saw how “big” the house is and when I went to hang out with them he saw my dad driving me around and dropping me off wherever I want to go. From what he observe he started to call me as the rich kid and when we’re back at school he would keep calling me that and tell other friend how “big” my house and how much of a “daddy’s girl” I am. And I hated all of it. I didn’t tell him that tho I would just casually deny that it’s not true when he bring it up. My friend means well and doesn’t know my situation so he isn’t making fun of me. But I still hate being called the “rich kid”.

c60q4c	2019-06-27 04:00:31	Throwawayasdfaec	AITA for telling my brother he should be home with the puppy?	"First time posting, apologies for formatting oddities. I'm at work trying to post this with little personal detail.

Backstory: Two weeks ago my brother convinced my dad to get a puppy, having done little-to-no planning in advance. 

I was not involved in choosing + deciding that a dog would be bought, but she is our father's and all three of us look after her. I love her all the same and am more than willing to help out.

She is somewhat nervous in their house still, she will yelp and cry if she's left alone for more than 5 minutes at a time.

My dad has a full time job, so he cannot look after her for a full day, sometimes taking her into work for half a day and then dropping her home.

My brother is currently in university and attends classes during the day. I do not live with them and work a full time job, but have gone over almost every night to help (at their request).

Three times I've worked from their home (and gotten less work done as a consequence) to look after her so she's not alone for extended periods.

&#x200B;

Today: My father took the puppy to work for the morning. My brother had no classes today and so decided to spend time with his girlfriend who lives 45 minutes away. The puppy had to be dropped back home and my brother was unwilling to go back and keep her company.

Our father suggested that my brother and the GF come down to our house and look after the puppy.

My brother thinks we should leave her alone for 4\~ hours a day because ""sometimes life is suboptimal"" (for the puppy), despite all sorts of online resources say not to leave them alone for 2 hours max at her age (9 weeks).

I told him this and said he should not have pushed for a dog yet if he's not willing to sacrifice personal time to keep the dog company so she's not lonely, to which he responded that I should be willing to ""make sacrifices"" and the one to leave work (and either lose money or struggle to work from home) instead of him taking his GF to our house.

I told him that if his view is that ""sometimes life is suboptimal"" and that we should ""make sacrifices"", then he should be willing to make his day suboptimal and make the sacrifice to drive and keep this poor puppy company.

He eventually agreed to drive the 45 mins to our house, but said that I was being ridiculous, that I'm ""so fucking dramatic"", and that it was ""pretty sad that it had to go like this"". He ranted a little about how ""I'm right, they should never have gotten a dog because clearly they're horrible people,"" which I never said.

I was told that I've upset the GF who believes this is her fault for spending time with him and now both won't talk to me.

So that said, AITA for telling him that:

\- He should ""make sacrifices"" for the puppy

\- He should ""make life subpotimal"" for himself instead of for the puppy

\- He should not have pushed for a puppy if he's not willing to lose personal time to look after her"	Not the A-hole	0	0
