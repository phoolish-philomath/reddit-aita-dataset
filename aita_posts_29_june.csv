c78ox4	2019-06-30 03:49:46	Pj7547	AITA for telling my dad I was “sorry his wife was a drug addict and his daughter smelled?”	"So, a couple months ago my dad & I (18f) had been together all day and I wanted to have a conversation with him about my stepmom, but since I wasn’t fully comfortable just laying it all out, I decided to ease into it my talking about my half-sister (14f) who has terrible hygiene. 

Within the previous week, I had found two dirty pads in her desk drawer, listen to her refuse to shower and had listened to my uncle make a “joke” about how he hopes his kids don’t end up (smelling/being unclean) like her.

Anyway, I mentioned my uncle’s comment to my dad & he said he “didn’t care what anyone thought.” I was kind of confused by this comment & told him that while my uncle’s comment was rude, it’s true that she has bad hygiene. He told me he wasn’t controlling & didn’t want to make her feel bad. He also told me that he would parent the way he wants & that I’m not the parent.  Since things were starting to get a little heated & off-topic from what I wanted to actually talk about, I changed the subject to my stepmom. 

A little backstory on my stepmom: I’ve never liked her. Don’t know if that matters. About 10 years ago she was in a car accident & hurt her back. She started taking pain-killers & my aunt and I are about 90% certain she’s been addicted ever since. I’m also 100% sure she has/had an alcohol problem.It’s cut down a little recently since you can now feel her liver outside of her body. In recent years she’s been worse than ever, gaining 100 lbs,eyes rolling to the back of her head, falling asleep at random times, constantly taking trips to the bathroom & ALWAYS with her backpack. She has a thyroid problem & takes medicine to help that, but any medication I’ve looked up for the thyroid never has symptoms like this. 

Moving on, I brought up her alcoholism to my dad & he said she stopped. I moved on & started asking what kind of medicine she took & if anything was a pain-killer. I saw him tense up and explain that she’s just always super exhausted & if she was addicted to pills she was doing it on the downlow.  I told him I disagreed & he started to yell about how I’m being judgemental & I think I’m better than everyone, etc.  I started getting super frustrated and started yelling back about how hard it always is to talk to him & how I’ve been holding this in since I was a kid. He continued to yell & said I had a lot of nerve, etc, As we started to near the house I told him I gave up & that I was “sorry his wife was a drug addict and his daughter smells.” He flipped & told me leave. I left & felt guilty, but I’m not sure if I feel that I was in the wrong. I eventually came back when he called & told me to, but we haven’t spoken about it since.

AITA for what I said & how I handled the situation?

I've never been one for name calling or mockery of any sort, but I have never outright yelled at someone for it. I have been on a diet for a month now and have lost a lot of weight. The guys at work know about said diet because a lot of the time in the past month they have offered me food, which I have turned down and explained several times that I am dedicated to this diet.

&#x200B;

Today for lunch I was eating a low calorie microwavable meal when two of my coworkers came into the lunchroom, each with a personal pizza from some pizza place. One of the coworkers, who knows that I am on this diet, asked if I was eating a healthy meal and I said yes, then offered me a slice of pizza and I said no. Then the second coworker with his own pizza reiterated and asked me I wanted any of HIS pizza to which I replied ""did you not just hear me say no the first time it was offered?"" They were sitting next to each other so this was clearly to make fun of me. The first coworker then goes on to ask me more questions about what I'm eating and at this point I blow up and tell him to mind his business and he's interrupting my lunch time.

&#x200B;

I do feel somewhat bad for yelling at someone as that is not something I enjoy doing, but I did feel in this situation that I was being harassed and it was childish and unprofessional of them to continue with those kinds of actions.

&#x200B;

Edit: seeing this in the comments quite a bit and this was not the first time they have mocked me for being on a diet. Every time they've done it in the past I have tried to make it clear that I do not find their insults about this matter funny and weight loss is extremely important to me at the moment."

I didn't have a problem waiting another 15 minutes so I took a seat and just chilled on my phone. I should also clarify I already ate prior to arriving at the park(I had Waba Grill). One of the moms comes up to me and asks if I want a slice of pizza and I say, ""no thank you, I already ate."" She proceeds to say, ""Are you sure we have plenty left"". I once again tell her no thank you but she tells me, ""C'mon I know you want a slice, go eat"". If I have to explain myself more than 3 times then you've successfully managed to both annoy and piss me off but I was at a kids party and she was a stranger so there was no need for me to lash out. So I go ahead and tell her, ""Please I'm fine I already ate no thank you I'll grab a slice if I change my mind but can you please stop asking me?"". She then tells me that if I'm going to have an attitude then I should wait outside. I have no clue where this came from or why she's all of a sudden getting on my ass. I told her I meant no disrespect but you asked me three times and my answer was going to stay the same. I'm then told that there's no need for my attitude and she once again asked me to go outside before she gets her husband and that she'll tell my cousin that I'm outside when he's ready.

I get mad at him and tell him I am too frustrated to talk and he says “why, just because I wasn’t home in time” in a snarky remark. And then I said “are you dumb or playing dumb”. 
He knows exactly what he did and he knows he could’ve texted me cancelling plans. He never cancels, just never shows up or shows up hours late.

I’ve even talked to my friends about it, they agreed that they recognized they were in the wrong, agreed to change to help, and then didn’t. 

This summer not one of them has tried to keep in touch with me. A couple of them are even just 30 minutes away from me and just nothing. I’ve reached out to them to try and keep in touch but none have made the effort to ever be the first to reach out to me. 

Just tonight there was a birthday party and pretty much every friend went, I didn’t but that was because I honestly didn’t want to be around them while I was dealing with these feelings. That’s actually the only time anyone has talked to me, to ask if I wanted to go to this event that everyone was going to. 

But I’m moving in a few weeks and I’m thinking of just not telling anyone when I’m leaving and to just dip in silence. I figure that if no one is going to put in effort to this friendship, then why should I try to do the same? I can make friends elsewhere. And this isn’t a small move.

They kept on insisting and i decided to go but only if we were to return in the time we agreed. They accepted the deal and we went to the party. So we got to the party and when was time to leave they decided to break the deal. I got really pissed and basically said if we didnt go i would stop hanging out with them. We left a lot later than agreed and i barely talked all the way home.
Important details: the party was like 30 miles from where we live we stayed in the weekend and since i dont have car the only option.was to go with them.

"For some background info I (36F) made friends with a woman (31F) at my bingo group a few years ago. We became pretty close and would hang out at least once a week. During this time my life was getting turned upside down fairly regularly due to career changes, family issues, and a major health problem. 

Over time I noticed that whatever I or anyone else was going through in my life, somehow she was ""dealing with the same thing"" only worse. Her family is pretty well off, but she insisted that she was not supported by them and had to scrimp to even clothe her kids. That despite living with her father, he never helped with anything. She would tell people all sorts of stories about her family. Of the ones I remember;

1. That her father was extremely abusive to her mother, and had killed her in cold blood (but got away with it because he was rich.)

2. That her father made her pretend to be a boy until she was 17 because he didn't want a daughter.

3. That the females in her family were branded at birth and she was an outcast and denied all rights because she refused to allow them to brand her daughter.

4. That her brother was a meth addict and that his children were being taken away by the state and given to her. 

5. That she had a genetic disease that has made every member of her family go blind in their left eye. But don't ask them about it.

6. That her, her husband and children were going to be put in witness protection for testifying against her father. 

7. That the gym we were going to was calling her father and her brother to report everything we did.

8. That she had leukemia and was dying.

9. That she was a gold medal winning gymnast who had been forced to give up the Olympics  due to a heart condition.

If I won at bingo I would end up either giving my winnings to her due to some ""urgent need"" (ie. her cat was sick and the vet put it on a special diet that they couldn't afford, Her daughter needed a dress for a holiday concert at preschool).

Just before Christmas her car broke down and her father had given them a car for an early Christmas gift, but was refusing to help pay for it to get registered as he expected them to cover that cost on their own.  They were on a very fixed budget and couldn't afford the extra expense. 

 I saved all of my tips over the holiday to help with the registration costs. I saved up over $500 and presented her with it the next time I saw her. 

When I walked her to the car I saw that she already had the new licence plate and registration.  The next day she tells me that her father paid for new bowling shoes, balls, and paid all the fees for a league by giving her the exact amount I had given her, in cash. 

I stopped talking to her at that point.

I matched with a girl on Tinder and messaged her, because I'm bored and I'm moving around a lot between now and next year. We talk a little bit and this girl seems maybe a bit too eager to agree with me, and seemed less enthusiastic about the very things she said were the things she loved most after I mentioned being lukewarm on one or two of them. I didn't think too much about it, because I figured that's the kind of game you play at this stage. The match happened kind of late, and so I end up getting tired as fuck and offering to pick things up the next day. I would have gone and messaged again the next day, but then she signed off by referring to me as ""love."" This made me extremely uncomfortable and made me think that she was going to be somewhere between uncomfortably clingy and a full on stalker. I didn't message the next day but didn't bother unmatching, because she ended up being buried under a new set of matches and I figured the same would happen to me on her end. Anyway, today I changed a small part of my bio on tinder and apparently she saw it on her feed and messaged again. I'm a little scared.

&#x200B;

Finally, I am an American and live in America, no one in my area would use the word ""love"" as a casual greeting as one would in the UK. It would only be something that you called someone with whom you were involved. There may be a small chance that she is a British expat, based on the fact that her name is more common in the UK than the US, but based on what is mentioned in her bio, I highly doubt it.

One of the girl, Hannah, was in a 3-year relationship when she found out her boyfriend, John, cheated on her from the other woman, Francis.

Francis knew John had a girlfriend but chose to pursue John anyways. Francis lied to Hannah about certain things involving Francis and John. After confronting John, Hannah found out John also got involved with Francis's sister, Pamela for a while during the fall 2017 and Francis's nudes were leaked to his friends when John let them borrowed his device.

Hannah asked us if she should tell Francis about John & Pamela and the leaked nudes. I told Hannah to just stay out of it because of 1. Francis lied to Hannah, 2. John, his family, and friends that knew Francis said she was crazy and had threatened to beat them up with her Latino gang friends.

Other friends said IATA for doing that. They think Hannah should let Francis know, but I think Francis might not believe her and might do something to her in retaliation.

c788go	2019-06-30 03:01:03	pinkdolphin0029	AITA for not bringing my family of 7 to visit my mother at Christmas?	"Here's the backstory...

I (31F) have a husband and a family of 5 kids ranging in ages of 1 to 9 years old. I'm a busy mom and really immerse myself in their school, activities and such. We moved half way across the country when my husband and I got married. My mom was not thrilled at all about this. I promised to visit her at least once a year  by rotating holidays of Thanksgiving and Christmas. She promised me she would come visit me too. I can count on one hand how many times my mom has taken the initiative to visit me since my husband and I got married 11 years ago. 

This year we are supposed to go visit her at Christmas. It is a big deal to take my huge family across country to see her. We have to drive because she doesn't have anything for the kids to play with, car to drive, places for the kids to sleep and so on. So I pack up our trailer and take all of our crap with us. 

My mom likes to ""play"" I guess. Since she divorced my now passed away father she dates a lot and does her little beauty rituals for herself. I am not judging at all...if she wants to,...she can go for it! However, she always complains she is broke. I asked her specifically to come visit this summer. I have asked and begged. Even offered to pay for a plane ticket. I get the ""I am broke."" Or ""can my boyfriend come too?"" I am not paying for his freaking ticket for who ever she is currently dating. Sorry not sorry. 

So far she has been to the Grand Canyon and a trip to Canada with her boyfriend this summer as well as a big wedding trip back in the spring. 

I have had it. She never wants to see my kids, only me really. She was never excited for me to have kids anyway. The only time she says she misses them is if her boyfriend is around so she can show off her maternal grandma side for show. 

I've decided I am not dragging my family out for Christmas if she doesn't come visit this summer. I am also taking back the whole, ""I will pay your ticket."" Thing too. 

I am trying to do the whole golden rule thing and do unto others but over 10 years about it being about her, I'm a little over it.

c788eb	2019-06-30 03:00:54		AITA for being upset at my friend’s lack of communication?	My friend, who I’ve known since my freshman year of high school, has very recently been distant. Before this we had talked every day, FaceTimed occasionally, and hung out monthly. I had noticed lately that I was having to double text him for a response that usually wouldn’t show up until the following day. This friend and I had a falling out during winter of last year. This was because he had asked me on a date and I had told him I wasn’t in a good mental state and I knew would not be a fit partner, so I declined. (I was experiencing an episode of major depression and trying out different medications). This really hurt him and he did not talk to me for a couple months. It bothered me but I respected his need to be distant. However, we rekindled the friendship and talked about the incident and I expressed that I did have some feelings for him but I couldn’t sacrifice my mental health and our friendship continued. Lately though, I expressed to him that I felt as if I was pestering him with my texts. He responded saying “that’s just who I am as a person” and lastly, “you can be mad if you want but I mean it’s not like we are dating.” I know he still has feelings for me and I was beginning to develop stronger ones for him but when he said that it really hurt me.

c787qx	2019-06-30 02:59:00	marishkins	AITA if I don’t want my boyfriend to vape in the bedroom	When we started dating four years ago, we were both vaping. I quit 2.5 years ago, and at first I was fine with him vaping in the bedroom and everywhere else in the house, but for the past few months it became irritating when he is vaping in the bedroom and I have to inhale it. Our bedroom is quite small, and when we’re watching TV, it literally becomes foggy in the room because of the clouds of smoke (not to mention the smell). I asked him a couple of times to not vape when I’m in the bedroom with him (I don’t ask him to stop doing it anywhere else in the house), but I keep getting dismissed or shut down, with him saying that he is reducing the nicotine content and quitting soon (he’s been quitting for a year now), or there is something that I do that irritates him, and he puts up with it. He also turns on the fan pretending it would help (which only distributes the smoke around the room evenly), and opens the window, which really doesn’t help if he picks up the vape 5-10 minutes. I’ve brought it up several times , but I keep getting ignored. Everything else in the relationship is great, and he is a super caring guy. AITA if I want my boyfriend to stop vaping in our bedroom?

c787l6	2019-06-30 02:58:32		AITA for talking to my friend's girlfriend about their relationship?	"So, I have known this friend of mine (let's call her Susan) for 6 months. We were kinda close, she trusted me and enjoyed my company. She has a girlfriend (let's call her Monica), with whom I'm not that close with. I came to Monica for advice about something and later on she did the same, asking for help with their relationship and getting some issues off her chest. 

I listened and replied with validation, sometimes recognizing Susan's faults. Things escalated though and soon I was replying to screenshots of conversations between them and I was giving highly opinionated advice, which included negative things about Susan.

Things came to a peak when she sent me a screenshot of Susan explaining how she goes on and off with Monica to get her attention (she knows that's childish but says that's the only way she knows how to get attention) that she has 5 different psychological problems, doesn't go to therapy and doesn't take medication and expects to be understood.

I reply by telling Monica to get out, that she's too young to deal with this, to believe Susan when she tells her who she is. Because at that point, she's saying she's sick and doesn't want to get treated.

Here's the thing: Susan got ahold of this conversation and got super upset at me. She told me I had influenced Monica too much, that I almost broke then up, that it was dishonest to talk bad things about her to Monica, that I must have had bad intentions to do so, and that I was wrong. She didn't even want to hear what I had to say and was sad that I was even attempting to explain myself.

I reread the chat messages and was quite shocked because I didn't remember saying those things when Susan confronted me. So I sent a reply telling her I was completely wrong, that there was no justification and that I was out of line. However, my girlfriend tells me I wasn't guilty and that I had the best intentions, I just didn't know the whole story. My friends think I messed up, but understand why I said that.

So, AITA?

In the mean time my mom asked if I could hang out with my younger sister that day since she doesn’t have many friends, I told my mom I could probably figure something out that day and left it at that. 

Cut to earlier this week I actually managed to get the day after Canada day off work so I excitedly messaged my friends and told them I can go. My mom is now really upset at me for going with my friends even though she’s kind of forcing me to do something with my sister. I offered to even spend the whole next day with her but my mom says I’m still choosing friends over family.

So I’d just gotten back from a college visit yesterday, and four of my friends had made a Snapchat group message asking if we wanted to go to the movies yesterday. I happily agreed as I hadn’t seen some of them in awhile. The only problem was, my sister wasn’t included in the group message.

My friends picked me up, and we had gone to see the movie, and we all had so much fun. I just got back though and my mom sat me down and talked about how I should’ve asked if my sister could go too as she had felt really left out that she wasn’t invited. Her future roommate was part of the group as well, and that particularly hurt her feelings. 

But as I’d mentioned before we’re very different people with different personalities and senses of humor. She never really meshed well with that specific group (minus her roommate). Also about half of my friends were LGBT and they were really the only ones I could talk and joke about my sexuality with and just feel free about it as my sister was never really comfortable with it. That’s a whole other post though.

I do feel bad that she wasn’t invited and my mom said I’d have to ask if she could come too the next time we did something. However I just feel we wouldn’t have had as much fun if we did. I do love my sister though and I feel the need to say that. AITA in this situation though?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c783va	2019-06-30 02:47:41		AITA for suggesting a friend [50F] (former GF) keep her distance from a young man with Asperger syndrome?	"I \[50M\] have a good friend (former GF), and we hang out together often.  There's nothing romantic going on between us anymore, and I'm OK with that.  She belongs to a small church, where I occasionally attend events.

There's a young man \[23M\] with Aspergers that attends the church.  He's a large man (6'3"" and 250 lbs) with the behavior of a 12 year old.  He has no other family members who attend.

As is the case with many people with Asperger syndrome, this guy is very socially challenged.  He'll normally show up to events dressed in gym shorts, flip flops and torn up t-shirts; many of which have rude or suggestive graphics on them. He will speak up with inappropriate topics in the middle of events.  He gravitates towards the women.

He's always staring at the women in the church, often walks around with a chubby (semi erect penis underneath his gym shorts), and touches himself frequently.  He makes it a point to hug all the women in the church and attends teenager education classes (several of the teens have reported behavior that make them uncomfortable).

I've noticed he is really fixated on my friend.  Beyond hanging around her anytime she is around, he texts her multiple times a day, calls her and wants to meet with her at the church in private sessions to ""learn"" more about the faith.  She entertains this because she has compassion for him and his autism.  There's no chance that she's interested in him beyond that.

After an event this past weekend, my friend and I had lunch.  I mentioned that it might be inappropriate to engage with this guy one on one or to engage with random texts or phone calls.  It's not that she would have any sexual interest in him, but he's a big powerful guy who appears to be struggling with something that looks a lot like puberty-type behavior.

She flat out told me that I'm a jealous asshole, that she can take care of herself and left the lunch.  I haven't heard from her since.  I'm willing to let it go, but I'm not sorry for pointing it out to her.

c783pp	2019-06-30 02:47:15	Lindts	WIBTA if I humiliated my aunt?	"Background: My aunt and my immediate family now have bad relations as of a year and a half ago. We haven't spoken at all except between other family members to communicate. My aunt borrowed money from us in the amount of $13k three and a half years ago and has yet to pay us back a cent. 

My question is, would I be the asshole if I were to publicly say to her around our community when she greets me, ""I don't really want to talk to you until you pay me back enough to buy a Birkin."" 

For context: my aunt has always borrowed money from us, interest-free. We have cosigned cars for her, we have given her money no questions asked even when we had our sights on different business ventures. We put our lives on hold to always help her out. The money that she owes us currently was used as a down payment for her house and for a fancy fridge (one of those smart fridges). She has shown my mother zero respect in the workplace (we're the employer), and has left since things have turned sour. 

We're not aggressive people, so we don't repeatedly ask someone for repayment. However, it's become hard because my aunt has constantly shown through her actions that:

1) she's prioritizing buying other stuff (non-essentials) rather than paying us

* Around the time my parents decided to gift me with my second car, my aunt went and bought the same car, lower trim. At the same time, another employee had also gotten a new car. My aunt is a person who likes to have what others have, which is fine, except she still hadn't paid us back. We were not pleased in the slightest. She also did not need a new car. 
* Buying luxury bags with the money she borrowed from us.

2) she doesn't give a crap about my mom's (her sister) feelings

* My aunt is younger than my mom. In our culture, you're supposed to respect your older sibling, and my mom had never given reason to be disrespected. My aunt continues to disrespect my mom by messing with our business even though she no longer works there.

3) she has no intention of ever paying us back now that we're not on good terms. 

* We have asked maybe once or twice every year since we have loaned out the money for her to pay us back. Not even my grandmother can talk sense into her. 

&#x200B;

I am about done with giving money interest-free and letting her enjoy the high life that she doesn't deserve. At the same time, I know I feel angry and I want to say something. I know the thing that would hurt her most is if our community knew how in debt she was. To owe someone that's not a bank so much money is embarrassing, and she's all about image. I know when we were still close that she always browsed Facebook and would see her friends with all these fancy things and I know she wanted it. It's just, those things you don't need but you're willing to borrow money from your family to no end and show no respect.

&#x200B;

I have a birthday coming up and I wanted to use it as an opportunity to have a reunion with some mutual friends that my good friend and I have in common. I tend to be very informal with my birthdays, and typically only invite a few people to meet me for dinner and drinks or some similar activity. I sent out some feelers to a small circle of people to see if anyone would be up to hanging out. My good friend said he was, and thus far has been the only person to say he wanted to meet up. 

&#x200B;

He just reached out to me to tell me that he was bringing his new girlfriend, who I have not met. When he told me that it rubbed me the wrong way. If  more people tell me that they want to meet up I wouldn't have a problem with him bringing her along, since I will have other people to talk to. But as of right now it looks like I am going to be a third wheel on my birthday with my good friend and a stranger. I haven't said anything to him because I don't want to be bitchy about this or overreact when I shouldn't. But I can't shake the prickly thought that it was rude of him to invite her without asking me or considering how awkward it will be for me to be a third wheel on my birthday. I'm also considering just cancelling altogether so we can just avoid awkwardness all around.

c77yq5	2019-06-30 02:32:42	sinful_cheru	"AITAH for challenging by boss about her ""disparaging"" comment about contractors."	"We were invited to a barbeque by an ex-co-worker who left the company I work for 3 months ago and we were all having a good time until the ex-co-worker mentioned that she still hasn't been paid for her last month of work before she left. Most of the attendees of the cookout myself included are contractors who work for the company through ""trusted"" vendors, hence my boss's answer to the ex-colleague was that it's not her problem since the company already paid the vendor and it's the vendor who is responsible for this. I gave my opinion saying that the company is also responsible for this since the person was working for them and they have to hold the vendor accountable if they don't take care of their employees. from here the conversation went downhills and my boss was so offended and the conversation continued like this.

**Boss**: The reason I work for contractors is to not worry about things like this and I don't even have to worry about firing people or anything of that matter, I just write an email to the vendor saying due to budget cuts release employee X and that it.

**Myself**: If you don't hold the vendors accountable for abusing employees, you will lose top talent.

**Boss**: Contractors come and go all the time and I don't care about losing talent and you are free to leave anytime, and she mentioned that I am entitled and self-important or something to that nature.

**Myself**: I don't think it's an entitlement for me to ask that an ex-employee get paid for the work that she has done.

**Boss**: Since you don't have any visa restrictions or what-so-ever why don't you leave and work somewhere else that makes you happy 

&#x200B;

All this happened in front of all our co-workers who are contractors and have visa dependencies and they were all in disbelief that I talked back to my boss and asked me to keep quiet. I might have come as arrogant but it's just who I am and I can't stand people abusing their power just because my paycheck comes from them. 

This happened a week after I was offered a full-time job with the company but I plan to quit my job after this incident or I might also get fired on Monday(who knows, as she said she just needs to send an email to the vendor to release me due to budget cut). I plan to bring this to someone's attention before I leave and I need to hear your verdict and advice on how to handle this."	Asshole	0	0

She is always yelling and complaining, and just stresses everyone out. She makes having guests over to the house a complete nightmare and is just very stuck up about some things. i (f) consider myself a kind and reasonable person, so i’ve tolerated this behavior and i’ve let it build up for quite some time. So roommate 3(m) has had several sit downs with 1 and 2 in the last 2 months or so, explaining that if they don’t get their act together we will have to kick them off the lease. 1 refuses to listen, doesn’t clean up anything(i’m 100% serious, she has not cleaned a single thing since moving in). 1 also buys a LOT of food, leaving little space for 3,4,5,6. my boyfriend and i (5,6) have had food go missing as well and haven’t gone to the GC about it, but still voiced our frustration in person. Last week we all had a talk about our groupchat being only for housing, rent, supply purposes etc. So fast forward to today, 1 blows up in the group chat about some missing cheese dip from the fridge. roommate 4(m) and his gf are vegan. 4 gets very upset with her, which is hard to do because 4 is very calm and kind about mostly everything. Because he gets extremely upset about this, he sends a somewhat harsh text asking her to stop with the bullshit in the group chat, she leaves the GC without a word. Someone has yet to own up about eating this missing queso, so 1 is huffing and puffing and just generally being bitchy. i would like you to note that 1 is notorious for eating others food without asking.

I have the standard disagreements with the church political and all that, but I've always felt incredibly and deeply uncomfortable at a mass. No matter how many times I went it never felt ""right"", and frankly I'd be just as comfortable and fitting in at a mosque. And this isn't due to a general aversion to religion, because I never felt that way attending Lutheran services (my father and that side of the family is Lutheran) or other Christian ones. I have a deep aversion to being considered a ""non-practicing Catholic"", and want to remove myself from that box and be simply ""non-Catholic"" since I honestly believe I am not on some higher level.

Because of this, in high school my family started going to the Lutheran church nearby as frequently as mass and once I graduated my mom promised to never ask me to attend mass ever again. However she is asking me to attend my brother's confirmation in a year, saying she's only not asking me to ever go to ""normal"" mass anymore.

I am adamantly against this. First of all I was invalidly confirmed and didn't believe in it, and I'd want to save him from the same fate. Second of all, I can't even pass by Catholic churches without getting feelings of anxiety and being deeply uncomfortable. And for that church, I can't pass by it AT ALL, I once did and had an anxiety attack. I once had to tell my mom to take a different route to the mall when we went shopping to not pass by it. Actually going IN, or seeing the inside and altar would be an extreme level of anxiety and traumatizing, I'd very likely throw up.

Once I told this to my mom, she asked me to at least consider a compromise of not attending the confirmation itself but the reception party. I'm still concerned about doing this, I don't like the idea of giving him a gift for performing such an (in my eyes) vile and evil action, and I don't know if I could hold in my feelings around relatives and not insult the event. It's not that I want to be a bitch to my mom and brother, I just don't know if I could actually handle it.

Due to distance and other issues, we've only been able to meet once, which was over new years. As of recently, I started a new job and don't have any vacation time built up yet, so anytime I take off is all unpaid and not guaranteed.  

Based on the fact that I might not get the time off, I decided to make backup plans. I talked it over with my girlfriend and got the okay from my parents to have her up for the week my family is gone. She would take a bus up and spend the week at my house while my family was gone.

As of today, I found out that I got most of the week off, only missing 2 days of the week, which would mean I have the opportunity to drive where my family is and join them for the vacation. My parents even offered for me to use one of their cars as to not add miles on my own. One of the main draws of the family vacation is going with some family friends who we don't spend a lot of time with anymore because they moved a long time ago. 

knowing all of this, I still have decided to stay back and spend the week with my girlfriend. unsurprisingly, my family was not all too thrilled about this. My mom respects that I'm an adult and can make my own decisions, but my younger brothers were all disappointed that I would rather spend the week with my girlfriend than with them. One of my brothers took it extremely personally and was very mad at me.

To make light of the situation, I told my daughter, ""Dance may be a bit harder to you, but you're talented at eating candy!"" I just wanted to joke around and make her feel better. 

My daughter got really upset and said that what I stated was insensitive and unhelpful. She carried on for hours, and my wife told her later to stop whining, as my wife's dad said harsher things to her growing up. 

My wife didn't exactly defend me, though. 

My daughter hasn't spoken to me since I made the comment. AITA for just trying to make light/lighten the mood of a really upsetting situation for my daughter?"	Asshole	0	0

c77s1k	2019-06-30 02:13:07	voidineveryway	AITA: I told my sister she should tell my cousin that her secrets are being shared amongst family, now I’m being blamed.	"This just happened. 

I (F21) was talking to my little sister (F13) in the car. My sister made the comment to me that our mom knew that our cousin (F16) was bi. My sister asked how she knew that and she said that our aunt (cousins grandma) told her. I made the comment that if it were me, I would tell the cousin that her grandma is sharing her secret. My little sister and our cousin are best friends. My thought process was: if my grandma was telling other people my HUGE secret, I would want to know. 

So, my little sister did what i suggested and told our cousin. Our cousin confronted her grandma(our aunt) and told her, crying, that she was upset that she betrayed her trust. 
My aunt texted my little sister telling her that she did not tell our mom about her, (she did) and to tell our cousin that she didn’t do that. Our aunt calls our mom and gets onto HER for betraying HER trust because she had told our mom in “confidence.” The thing is, she had asked my mom to ask my sister if she knew that our cousin was bi. 
If my little sister didn’t already know, then her grandma would have told TWO people. 

My mom called me and was telling me (and my sister) that we were in the wrong because its not our business. She said that we opened a can of worms making our aunt be mad at her. She thinks that our aunt wont talk to her anymore and shes very mad. She started to say, “listen, adults can..” and i cut her off saying our cousin deserves just as much respect as anyone else and she cant play the “we’re the adults here” card. 

I’m sorry if this was confusing. 
Am I the asshole here? 

TL;DR My aunt shared my cousins secret that she is bi to my mom and my mom told my sister. I told my sister to tell her cousin, now my mom is angry at me, my aunt is angry at my mom, and my cousin is angry at my aunt... AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

So, I (13M) have a family reunion coming up in August, and I am more privacy-oriented than the average person. I've done some digging and found out just how intrusive Google is. I know that almost every single one of my family members uses Google Photos, so I want to tell them not to take photos of me without my consent. That'll be hard enough on its own, but there's a major group photo as well, which everyone attending the reunion is expected to participate in. So WIBTA for excluding myself from the group photo?

c77q6a	2019-06-30 02:07:37	samsop	AiTA for telling my sister she's not really a software developer?	"My sister is 24, she's been a content editor for a regional software house for 2 years now. She graduated with a bachelor's in business administration but shifted to content editing and light front-end (read: web design) work specifically for this job opening. I was a sophomore computer science undergrad at the time and, with what little experience in development I had, tried to help her grasp the basics. At the same time, I had learned the importance of self-teaching in this line of work so left her to practice on her own, only giving her pointers and material, and only once sitting down to help her code. 

While she did get the job, she initially got the impression she was rejected after her interview because she couldn't tell the interviewer what HTML stood for. She blamed me for not helping her enough, and hence not getting the job. I apologized and told her I would be of better help next time. She got the job the next day. I was very happy we could possibly work together one day. 

Fast forward 2 years, I'm 21, graduated one week ago. During those 2 years I did 2 internships at the same company, made an actual developer of myself, worked with both domestic and international clients on freelance gigs (worth thousands of dollars, a hard currency in the Middle East) with a partner, and graduated with a decent GPA. 

I make the suggestion I am looking for a decently paid non-junior developer position as my first job. Peers with a similar skillset got senior positions as well as ex-fresh grads I know. I worked hard on myself and am familiar with the corporate environment. I don't need to spend 3 months being taught how to code all over again. She gets angry and tells me I need to get back to reality, my first job will pay me half of what I suggest I expect (and peers in my position get paid), and that I know nothing about what a corporate environment is and how the hierarchy works. I snap. 2 years of my frustration with her throwing technical terms around me and acting like she has an idea what I do, nae, judging me based on what I don't do as if she can tell what it is because she saw someone sitting at a nearby desk at her office doing it, all come out at once. I become the stuck-up tech guru I never wanted to be. I tell her to stop judging me and pulling me down if she has no idea what I do, that I put 2 years of effort into improving myself and I am just getting started but I know my worth on the job market. 

Maybe I am clueless. I don't know a lot about applying for jobs. I graduated a week ago and only have hear-say knowledge. My mom thinks I'm a dick. I told her I felt she isn't helping me like I once tried to help her. She says I embarrassed my sister by telling her she's not a developer so shouldn't judge my worth using knowledge she doesn't have.

c77prx	2019-06-30 02:06:26	jessiejaneg	AITA for asking my gf to pay for dinner	"So I [25m] asked my gf [23f] to pay for dinner the other night and she gets mad at me whenever I ask her to pay. It was earlier in the relationship, but when the check came I told them we would split the check. And she ended up giving me shit for that.

So Ive been paying for almost every meal. And i would feel bad if i didnt or feel like im a bad boyfriend for not paying for her. She will pay sometimes like when she really wants to go somewhere or she will say lets go to so and so ill pay. Mainly because she will never drive and i had said i didnt want to drive that far that night. Whenever we go to eat the drive is 30 minutes or an hour.

This night i had asked her to pay, but she had no money in her account and i asked why she never wants to pay for me. But she didnt want to go into it. I dont know if she has money in her savings but ive been taking money from my savings to pay for my credit cards. She also bought herself skin care products the day before spending $200. She tells me she wants to pay off her credit cards before using her card anymore.

Anyways after i asked her to pay and she said she didnt want to argue about it tonight she could obviously tell i was upset about it. And she wouldnt really look at me for the rest of the dinner. And wouldnt start any conversation. I kept asking if anything is wrong.

I confronted her in the car and i told her i hate this, and i said sometimes i feel like why am i even here. Asking if she can just talk to me at least. 

She told me she gets mad when i ask her to pay or hint at it and if i were to ask that makes her not want to pay.

The night before this we got on the topic and i ended up saying she never pays for me or anything. This is where she told me i never ask.

So this was me following up on that and asking. Well in the car she ended up crying saying i was being mean from what i had said earlier. And i agree that was mean. I was just upset and truly wondering why wont she ever want to pay for dinner or treat me when i always drive her where she wants to eat and pay for her.

She says this makes her feel bad and that shes not a good girlfriend. I didnt agree and told her shes a good girlfriend. But i just let her cry because i really felt ive been taken advantage of.

And this makes me feel like such an asshole...

But i never really want to go out to eat or crave any places. Shes always craving places and wanting to go to dinner and i take her because i like being with her and i wanna see her happy. 

And i feel like if i tell her no i dont want to go or i want her to pay she will make me feel bad about it. I havent even asked her to split a check since because of how she reacted that one time i wanted her to split it."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c77pio	2019-06-30 02:05:39	ConstantFacepalming	AITA For Not Wanting to Sweep Weeds on My Birthday?	"Hi Reddit, this just happened and... let's just say I'm not a happy camper currently. It's not a huge issue, I just need to rant. Sorry if there are any spelling and grammar issues in this...

I just turned 18 (yay adulthood) and I spent the whole day doing practically nothing, except thanking people for their gifts and kind words. I just get out of the shower and plan to spend the rest of my day playing a game on my phone. Then, I get a call from my mom:

Mom: ""Hey hon, can I get your help real quick, I'm out front (of our house)""

Me: ""Sure, I'll be right there""

From this small interaction (I'll let you be the judge) I assumed this was going to take all of five seconds to do. Not really. No. She told (not asked) me to get a broom and a dustpan and sweep up the weeds she was pulling out from our driveway.

Me: ""Why are you doing this right now?""

Mom: ""I don't know, just something to do""

Me: ""Mom, I don't know, I just got out of the shower"" (literally my hair is dripping wet)

Mom: ""Come on, it's not like you're doing anything....""

And she ended up forcing me to sweep up weeds. I didn't play the ""It's my birthday card"" because I KNOW that she would have said something along the lines of ""You are alive thanks to me blah blah blah, etc. etc.."" 

Throughout the duration of this (about 20 minutes), I feel a small twinge of anger inside me. Eventually, my dad comes back from who knows where and gives my mom and I a raised brow. He then promptly chuckles and goes inside. Thanks, dad.

I know this isn't as dramatic as some things on this subreddit and that I wasn't doing anything, but at the same time, it's my birthday and I kinda just wanted to chill out for the day you know? So, am I the asshole?"	Asshole	0	0

He was overall a good guy to be with without being perfect.I would say around 4 or 5 years ago he began to change. He got kicked out of college  2 or 3 time either for not showing up to class or simply only going to his Volleyball practice. Since he would not have to go to school anymore he would sleep until he would have to go to work at 5pm , would have to pick up one of my little sister at 4pm at her school When we would have to wake him up to go pick her up at school my other sibling(13F) would refuse to go because became verbally aggressive and would scare her and she would wait for me to come home to do it.The reason was alcohol and drugs. He has a problems with both and has since denied it . He got in 5 car accidents 1 of them we know for sure that he was drunk driving because the morning after my mom went outside and saw the front of the car destroyed and he didn't wake up when my mom tried to do so so much that she got tired and called me and my dad to go check on him in the after noon and was still a little under the influence when we went.The 4 others don't know for sure but would not be surprised if he was under the influence.He never paid for the 5 cars my mom did.Each car would end full of drug that starting it would make a draft of the drugs smell and my little sisters wouldn't want to get inside. At every family party he would drink and not stop until he would pass out after trowing up everywhere and make every kids in the house uncomfortable because of his behavior. H Last Christmas my family went on a vacation in Honduras that I didn't go because he was there and I refuse the offer and I don't regret it since it was the first time that I had a good vacation without drama coming from him and He did is drunken show there that spoiled the vacation for the others.He did much more but I am not writing  for that.

&#x200B;

Few weeks ago, a accident happen between ours dogs(Will tell if needed) and we had to put down a dog because it became dangerous for us .This choice was harder on my step father than anybody in the house because he was the ''only'' one who loved the dog. My brother was not happy with the decision and accused my mom that she put the dog down because it was her goal since the day the dog came in the house. My mom ranted to my dad about it .I saw the text, got mad and sent a rant to my brother saying that he changed for the worst, that I was ashamed to be his sister and so on . I went hard on him but I was tired that no one ever brought it up to him and that he never had any bad outcome for what he's doing I mean he could have killed someone in those cars crashs we are lucky that he didn't.

"Okay so, i’ve (18f) been babysitting for this woman, V, for a couple months now off and on. I was asked to babysit tonight about a week ago and promised her I’d be able to come through. She told me to be at her house at 6:30 and that she was going to leave for her concert at 7. I walk into her house (which is messy about 90% of the time anyway) and her kid, M, starts screaming at me to “watch out.” I kind of run backwards and notice a huge piece of tape hanging from the ceiling COVERED in flies.  I don’t mind flies, but like, dude.  So anyway, I kind of start walking towards the dining table which is a little bit aways from the fly tape and notice like 4 more hanging from the kitchen ceiling with probably 500 more flies on them in total. I kind of stand in the middle of all of it because I’m a little stunned and ask M what’s up. He tells me that a couple flies had gotten into his house after a camping trip and had laid eggs in the ferret poop.  I’m kind of in disbelief so I walk into the bathroom to pee and just like, chill, when like 50 flies start buzzing around me out of nowhere. I call my dad (who set me up with the job in the first place) and am like, do I really need to babysit right now? can I just leave? and he tells me that it would make both him and I look bad and that they’re just flies.  He even suggested I clean her house for her to help out. So I’m wondering, WIBTA if I tell V (who still hasn’t come downstairs) that I don’t want to babysit 15 minutes before she leaves? I feel like it would be wrong considering the fact that it’s been scheduled a week in advance, i’ve already been here 15 minutes, and i’m not THAT scared of flies. I just kind of have the heebie-jeebies. So, WIBTA?

UPDATE: I stayed and the night was fine. I had to fight off a couple flies but it was worth the money. I won’t be babysitting for her again, though"	Asshole	0	0

"To put things into context, I've been with my girlfriend for about 10 months. Both of us have stable jobs, so we've been talking about getting a place together. My reason for not going through with it just yet, is that I have 2 giant breed dogs. 

In all the time that we've been together, my girlfriend has made very little efforts to get to know them or to learn how to handle dogs. Even though she finds my dogs cute, she's never had any pets at home and doesn't really know how to handle animals. She's always complaining that ""dogs are a burden"" because if we want to go to the restaurant or to the movie theatre, we can't take them. She also said that she likes her own place to be very clean and that it's hard to keep an environment clean with dogs. She says that's why she's been hesitant to be around the dogs often.

Yesterday I confronted her on the phone about it. I said that while all of her concerns are valid, they don't justify not wanting to be around my dogs, especially if she wants us to live together eventually. She's talked about moving in together, but in spite of that, in the last months, whenever I've talked about learning some basic training commands with me, or about going to dog training classes together, she's always come up with excuses to not do it. ""I'm tired, I don't want to deal with the noise today"", so whenever you are tired of have a migraine, you're gonna ignore the dogs? What if I'm not home? This is just not acceptable. How can you keep talking about living together in those circumstances? I called her out for just being irresponsible and I wouldn't trust her around my pets ever.

She said that I was very harsh and started crying and hung up on me, and we haven't talked since then. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0

I mention this for background knowledge.

Now my parents want to go Costco to get food to donate to them for them to sell. They already make money off the other many donations, the ticket sales, and the program itself.

So when my dad goes out in the car i always come with him, me and my dad dont talk much so we dont have the best relationship. He would always use his phone while driving for stupid reasons like, example : asking my mom do we need milk or just to talk to a friend. It always pissed me off because he would drive on to pathways by accident (not fully on the path but just clipping the edge of it). and just rarely skipping a red light. So this is where it gets juicy. My dad was on his phone while driving and i was in the front passenger seat, i dont know why but this time i got REALLY pissed off, i didnt say anything because like i said we never talked so it was awkward. This time on the rare occasion he skipped a red light and there were two cops busy with another guy (who probably skipped the same red light) they never noticed since one cop was looking for supposedly alcohol and the other talking the driver so 15 year old me decided this was enough and smacked my hand on the horn ... it got there attention my dad came to a complete stop and a cop came over.

c77hb9	2019-06-30 01:42:05	BigMadLad	"AITA for playing ""too hard"" against a girl in basketball?"	"I love playing basketball even though I am small (5'6"" - 5'7""). I also ""talk trash"", but in the classic basketball way, and I am never mean with it. Examples include saying things like ""you can't guard me"", or if they shoot saying ""brick"". Most people within the basketball community not only accept this but think of it as a cultural element of pickup basketball. I am working on fazing it out, but it still is a natural inclination when I play. With this context, I was playing 3 vs 3:

I was matched up against a girl who was around my height. She also had a basketball-themed T-shirt on. I know that does not say she plays, but it was not a generic nike basketball T-shirt but one that looked like a tournament t-shirt or a HS team t-shirt. So, I assumed she played competitively and so didn't hold back. This would not be an asshole thing, but I proceeded to block her shot 3 times and stole it once when she was going for a layup. I did this while counting out loud each time I blocked/stole the ball. For example, when I blocked her the second time I said ""thats two"", at the third: ""three"", and when I stole it when she went up for a layup: ""four"". My team one the game, and when I asked if she wanted to ""run it back"" (i.e. play again), she somewhat sheepishly said she had to go and left. I felt bad initially after the experience, but to me she had the right gear on (t-shirt, good basketball shoes, etc) to imply she played often, which means to me she either should have been good or at least understand the culture of pickup basketball.

When telling this story to my friends as a funny experience I had, they proceeded to get angry at me and said I should have taken it easy on her, or at least not talked trash. Their argument was that because I ""played all the time"" that I should have known I was going to be better than her skill wise, and that as a dude I was stronger than her so it was an asshole move to bully her on the court. Plus, they dont understand trash talk as a cultural element of the game. While I agree that trash talking was phasing out as a cultural element, I responded that:

1. I never posted-up/used strength tactics in any way, and so at the same height she had equal opportunity to block my shot
2. her play style and clothing was indicative of having official basketball experience
3. I have never played any organized/official basketball so in fact she should have been better than me

They still disagree. So, AITA?

**TLDR:** I beat and talked trash to a girl in basketball who I thought would be good, enough to where she did not want to play again. AITA?

Edit: So it seems a lot of the YTA's are for the trash talk. I am not trying to sway that opinion, but I want to put it out there its not just me talking trash in pickup basketball.  I know trash talk is a cultural element as Gary Payton, Jason Kidd, and other NBA players often talk of trash talk as a cultural element, and are often asked in interviewers ""who was the best trash talker?"". Its seen as a skill in pickup basketball, at least in the areas I play in. Its definitely phasing out in today's game but its definitely not just me. If no one did it, I wouldn't either. The question of AITA is more centered around doing that to a girl, as opposed to doing it at all."	Asshole	0	0

c77eb2	2019-06-30 01:33:29	Dudely-Llama	AITA for shaming a kid in front of his peers?	"I helped run a summer camp about a year ago. It was in a National Park and it ran for three weeks. The kids would stay for the week coming in Monday and leaving Friday. Every week we would get a new round of kids. The camp had several cabins that were shared by counselors and campers.

So the first week I voluntarily stayed because I’m not from the area and where I was staying was a 45-50 minute drive away and doing that every day would be too much for my wallet so I stayed for the first week in my own cabin. The first week went so well so I decided I would go ahead and stay there the second week again. 

However, the second week did not go as well it was a really rough time for me emotionally I was broken up with by my long-term girlfriend and right afterwards found out that my credit card information was stolen in a state that I am not from or live in. The campers themselves we’re mostly great but a select few were very testing of my patience not to mention that one of my bosses wrote the schedules of the counselors specifically to fuck with me and make all the activities that I was overseeing more difficult and dangerous (my other bosses specifically the one I was working under witnessed the transgressions and agreed with me)

So the last week of camp came around and I decided for my own mental health that I was going to bare the cost and simply drive back every day. But when I showed up for the first time they had a shortage of male counselors and one of my bosses ask me to step in and stay in one of the cabins with another counselor and 4kids. The other counselor was hopelessly useless in controlling the kids and on top of that my responsibilities doubled. 

It was the last day and I was having trouble all week with this kid who we shall call Kyle. Kyle had a problem with authority and would ignore direction for his own safety and benefit. He insulted me plenty but I have thick enough skin normally to handle it but my patience was just wearing thinner. On the last day we have to hold a cleanup of the camp it’s helps expedite the cleaning and teaches the kids about leave no trace. They had come from a rafting trip and were tired. I tell them to get in line because we’re going to do a sweep of the grounds and really tried to make sure that everyone was staying in line. However Kyle refused to participate. We were standing out in the hot sun but Kyle held his own and sat down. He announced he’s not going to do it and so finally for the first time I snap on a kid. I get up and say “Hey everyone! Want to know why we’re just standing around in the hot sun and not doing anything? Because KYLE doesn’t want to participate! We’re not moving because of Kyle everyone turn and shame him!” Well he got up and participated. I felt bad and told everyone that I’m sorry for snapping. 

Am I the asshole for letting my emotions get the best of me and quite literally shaming a kid in front of his peers?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c77e3l	2019-06-30 01:32:57	panickysister	AITA for telling my brother and SIL that they are bad parents?	"I am 30 and there is a big age difference between me and my 48 year old brother Daniel and his wife Zoe who is also 48. They have a 15 year old daughter called Jessica. 

Daniel and Zoe are the sort of people who belief that there would be no crime or poverty if benefits were cut because people would have no choice but to work. I have worked with people on benefits and know for a fact that nobody wants to be on them and everyone would rather be working. Unfortunately Daniel and Zoe are the kind of snobby people who honestly believe that people are only poor because they don't work hard enough. They also think ''council estate'' teens who behave badly should be treated harshly which is odd considering their daughter.

Jessica is perfect on the surface. She is very beautiful just like her mum, has lots of friends and is extremely smart (sat her exams two years early and currently studying A Levels while still in school), but she's also a delinquent. She has been cautioned by the police for possession of cannabis as well as for drunken behaviour in public. She's also a bully. Daniel and Zoe have been called into the school many times because of various bullying accusations made against Jess and her friends. Daniel and Zoe are firmly convinced that these accusations are all lies. Their response is to tell Jess that those girls (the victims) are just jealous of her for being pretty, which is why they are making up these stories about her. The weed and drinking were laughed off as just ''what you do at that age'' even though before this they were saying kids who get in trouble with the police should be publicly named and shamed.

Several times Jess has held house parties at their place, and the latest one resulted in thousands of pounds worth of damage. Again they refused to blame Jess for this and said that things just ''got out of hand''. I genuinely don't understand what goes through their minds to arrive at these conclusions.

Earlier today my husband Tom and me went to my parents for dinner with Daniel's family. Jess thought it would be funny to ask if we got our clothes from the charity shop and said she wouldn't be seen dead in my dress. I was very drunk and asked them why Jess hadn't been taught manners. I said that I knew somewhere that they could take parenting classes and that it couldn't hurt because they were useless right now, and said that I'm looking forward to seeing Jess get locked up like all the ''bad kids'' they hate do. This made Zoe cry and the three of them left. 

Having sobered up I feel bad. Not necessarily for what I said, but because I'm not a parent. If we ever have kids I could end up being a worse parent than them. Am I right to make them feel like bad parents when I haven't walked in their shoes?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

My bf (17) is going out today with our mutual best friend (16), and that is totally fine by me, however before I started dating my boyfriend she was deciding between dating her current boyfriend (16)  and my current boyfriend. 5 months into her current relationship she realised she still has feelings for my boyfriend (whom I was not yet dating), when I started dating him she thanked me because now she could finally let those feelings go. I am unsure if she has and I want to explain the situation to my man but she swore me to secrecy. Another reason I'm upset is that I'm going to PNG tomorrow and won't be able to contact either of them for 2 weeks, my boyfriend is leaving for Japan in 5 days and will then be away for 10 days (again no contact) and he chose seeing her over seeing me and that's fine because he should hang out with his friends but it hurt my feelings. 

Any advice on what to do would be appreciated !!

He currently has no release date. He was supposed to leave me with his last paycheck in order for me to pay his storage unit up a couple of months, put some money on his books, and help out with the baby for the next little bit. He set up autopay on his car insurance, and as soon as his check hit his bank account, his insurance payment of $234 was taken out. That left me with $253 to last for the next 2 to 6 months. I told his brother he could drive his car for the next month because I wasn’t aware I could get any of the money back by cancelling the insurance early. Once I found out, literally 1 day later, I let my boyfriend know, and he insisted I either cancel the insurance and get at least $200 back, or have him pay me the $200. His brother doesn’t want to do either.

I’m willing to let him keep driving the car if he puts insurance on it, or pays the payment in full, but he’s saying it’s pointless to put insurance on a car he’s “only going to be driving a couple of weeks,” and that he “needs to be saving for a down payment on a new car.” His offer is $100.

Obviously, me and my friends were pretty upset that he decided to leave last minute to watch some horror movie with a chick that knew we all had plans. His excuse was “she invited me” and that “we all took it to heart”. He’s more angry at me because I said we have every right to be upset that he dipped and that he shouldn’t have accepted her invitation knowing that we had plans. He told me to fuck off and told everyone we were taking it too hard. Because of his choice most of our friends dipped as well and it left it with me and my other friend.

"I had a weird encounter last night and I just wanted to get some thoughts on how we acted. I \[23 F\] was walking home with my friend \[26 M\] around midnight last night, and as we were nearing my place there was this woman (probably in her 20s?) standing outside this condo building and holding her phone. She called out to us and asked us if we could just stand with her as she booked a hotel for the night on her phone. We were kind of weirded out by the question, so we asked her what she meant. I was getting weird/sketchy vibes from her, I'm not sure exactly why but I just felt uneasy. She said she just didn't feel safe being alone and she had nowhere to go, so could we just stand with her while she booked it?    


Now, we were in a downtown area, surrounded by lots of buildings and lights and there were a decent amount of people outside even though it was late. So I asked her why she didn't just go inside the lobby of the building she was standing outside of. There was literally a security guard and a concierge there so surely she would feel safe? And if not there were several neighbouring buildings and coffee shops etc. She said that she had just gotten into a fight with someone who lives in that building and people kept coming up to her and she feels unsafe and pleaded with us to stand with her. I still felt weird, I didn't get why she was just standing in front of the building she had just gotten into a fight with someone in then? She could literally have walked anywhere else... My friend still seemed a bit weirded out, but more like he was okay with standing there, but I didn't, so I apologized to her and said we had to go, and restated suggestions of where she could walk to feel safer, and we left. We both didn't really know how to feel about the situation, and agreed that it was weird, but now I'm wondering if I was paranoid for no reason and if we should have tried to help her more?"

c776wn	2019-06-30 01:11:58	sammy404	AITA for not empathizing with my girlfriend better?	"Hey guys so I love this sub and usually agree with the answers,  so let me know what you think about this situation.

So my girlfriend and I went out to eat tonight at a Korean BBQ place. Just a little background for those that don't know, at this place you sit next to a gas grill and cook raw meat that you order off the menu.  

Anyways, so while cooking I was cutting the meat and getting ready to serve it to us, but while cutting it, I pulled too hard, and a drop of the oil on the grill flew up and landed on my girlfriend's cheek. Of course she immediately held her cheek and said, ""ow that hurt"" and I realized what happened and this is where we disagree if what I did was right. 

So first I immediately said sorry, and asked if she was okay. She said no because it was still hurting.

At this point I was thinking everyone has had some meat juice from a grill or ember from a fire land on them and it hurts for a few seconds then stops. So at this point I figured she was going to be okay in a few seconds so I said sorry again and continued to eat. 

After my bite I realized she was staring at me in a very upset way and we started arguing.

From her perspective she thinks I did a terrible job empathizing, and I should have worried about her more. For example she said I should have asked how bad does it hurt, is it starting to feel better or other questions along those lines instead of just starting to eat again so soon. 

I can sort of understand where she's coming from, but from my view it was something I knew wouldn't hurt for very long, as I think everyone has had this happen to them at some point or another. I also thought it was weird I needed to keep asking questions that I sort of thought were meaningless until she said I could eat again. She has said after about 10 seconds it didn't hurt and if I had just waited, then she wouldn't have been so upset, but because I ate, she thought I didn't empathize with her enough.  

In my view I knew she would be okay in a few seconds, and I also knew there wasn't anything I could do immediately to make it feel better, so I continued with my dinner. 

So what do you guys think? Was she being a little too sensitive? or was I the asshole for not empathizing well? I know sometimes I struggle with that so I'm willing to accept my judgement.

So I text into my group chat (word for word)
""Hey, so I'm thinking of singing prince Ali from Aladdin for the talent show, opinions"" 

and one of my friends texts back

Yes she typed voice craks like that. Now I will admit what I did was kind of unnecessary but I was kind of mad about what she said. So I unfollow her, remove her from the group chat, then I leave the group chat myself. She later text me (I'm copying exactly what I'm seeing from our dm's.

 ""Ssksk I'm not trying to be rude n stuff but like you DID ask for my opinion and sometimes what I think is rude. Like ptf  like ask anyone who knows me personally.

Then I text back

""I was asking for your opinion on the song""

And she replied

""Then maybe specify idk. Anyway that's all I got to gn dude""

So two questions. Am I the asshole? and. Was I specific enough on what I wanted an opinion on?

She found an ad to become a Disney princess. She decided fuck it and apply and then received an email saying she got an audition. I personally was offended and upset given the fact that the auction was for Disneyland in Paris and we live in Australia. Knowing full well that it would mean she would need to move to the other side of the world and there is no opportunities that benefit me by moving there.

She never mentioned it was something she wanted to do. Other than when we would see Disney princesses do it on Facebook and we would meme it. 
In the weeks leading up to it. I never got to express my thoughts about it. I didn't want to risk the relationship based on something I thought was kind of silly. I mean. Who wants to be a Disney princess. The amount of scutinity and exposure of insecurities sounds absurd. 
She was psyching herself out of it the night before and I tried to call her nerves. And I emphasised that no matter what she chose to do. I would support her but here is my feelings and I don't wanna risk the relationship if you do get this. 
The next morning she decided not to go through with it and although she won't admit it. I can tell that she blames me for the whole situation. 

I feel that I was justified to say what I was feeling because I didn't want to risk losing her but also I didn't want her to hurt her self esteem or damage how she viewed herself when going to the audition. 
I always told her that I would support her no matter what and even if that was something I didn't want.

I had the unfortunate fortune of being born a gay man into a very evangelical family. I came out right after high school, riding the high of being recently graduated, only for my parents to tell me I was disgusting, not the child they raised, that I was being punished by god and if I was choosing to turn my back on him, they were choosing to turn their backs on me. These are all actual, quotable things they said to me at 18. 

I’m 27 now, and while at first we were somewhat in contact, after the first 3 years or so the only way I’d hear from or about my parents was through my younger brother, the only one of my 3 siblings willing to speak to me. I am in a loving and committed relationship, I am happy, and until now I thought my parents and family were in my past. Well, lo and behold, my cousin, my fathers sisters son, just came out!! Great for him, I’m proud of him. He is also 18, and his parents were confused but accepted him and now they are doing great and are happy and are an intact family. I guess my parents saw that and realized their mistake, because I got a call from a strange number that turned out to be my mom. That call ended up being nearly an hour of them explaining their mistakes and misunderstanding and blah blah blah. I think it’s bullshit. They don’t love me enough for me to allow them back into my life, and I know this because they shunned me for close to a decade. I ended the call by saying I had a lot to think about, and they didn’t seem pleased with that. As if showing love for their eldest son was such an amazing feat. I may be an asshole for this, but I can’t find it in my heart to forgive them. I’m happy now, but the last decade of my life has been filled with pain, isolation, confusion, and self hatred, and the majority of that was their fault. 

My partner thinks I should try to move on, as does my brother, but I feel a lot more comfortable staying separated from my family, no matter how bad they feel for kicking me out and leaving me completely alone in the world when I was so young."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c76znv	2019-06-30 00:51:39	advice9000	AITA for not wanting my husband to masturbate for hours at a time? [NSFW]	"Hello all, I expect this post to get a lot of various responses, but I’m curious to see what others think of this situation.


Husband [38M] and I [28F] have been together 8 years and married for 1 year. I am currently 30 weeks pregnant with our first child. 

We haven’t had consistent sex lately (probably for the past 5 months) because of the pains it causes me, although we did have sex last week, and while it did hurt a lot, it was nice to be intimate and close again. Also my sex drive has been pretty non-existent due to the pregnancy (knowing how much pain it’ll cause and how uncomfortable it is for me) and due to medications I’m currently taking.

Anyway, to the AITA part: my husband has a high sex drive, which I think is great for him. I would never judge him for his natural instincts and wants. We are very open sexually and about masturbation. When I began disliking sex as much lately, he asked if I cared if he went in another room and masturbated. Of course I had no issue, I want him to fulfill his needs however he can happily. 

The problem is that he will masturbate for HOURS. The last session was 5 hours, and if I’m being completely honest, I’m writing this because he’s been at it for 4 hours right now. I wouldn’t care but I’m a stay at home wife-future-mom with no access to transportation to do anything during the week, and he’s gone during the day for work. The weekends are our biggest chance to spend time together. Because of his lengthy masturbation sessions I feel like I’m losing precious time with him. I definitely don’t mind him doing it, it’s just the amount of time he spends doing it that bothers me.

If he cut it to 3 hours maximum I wouldn’t mind, but it seems the sessions are staying around 4-5 hours. He also does this occasionally (2-3 times) during the week, and definitely every weekend.

AITA for getting frustrated with the length of his masturbation sessions? What would you do in this situation?

c76z6y	2019-06-30 00:50:20	kingpbs	AITA for using my parents shower when they are away on a camping trip	"Slight background information: I'm a 22 year old college student, working over the summer, and living with my parents. my family enjoys camping, and goes out on a camping trip every other weekend or so. I'm busy a lot of the time, and don't go on the short ones to nearby places.

Actual story: My parents went on a camping trip a few weekends ago, and I had to work, so I couldn't tag along. No one in my family is home, I've got the place to myself, so I decide to shower in my parents bathroom.

To give you an idea of my bathroom vs my parents bathroom, my bathroomhas a sink, a toilet, and a shower. The shower could maybe fit 2 people, but its be very tight, and my shower head is a piece of garbage that gets clogged with flakes of copper from the piping, so I'll have 2 or 3 holes shooting lasers, and about 10 holes that are just little trickles (my parents know about this).

My parents bathroom has 2 sinks, a separate room for the toilet, and a shower with 3 shower heads, 2 that are mounted, and 1 that is a handle that can be used in your hand (granted the handle head doesnt even work), and could easily fit at least 7-8 people, and still have more room than my shower with 2.
Also this shower does not have any issues with the copper clogging the head.

I told my mom today that I used her shower when they went on their trip, because it was the last time I saw the scissors (I had surgery the same weekend and couldn't get it wet, cut off the trash bag after shower, but dont want to use the extra space in their shower for my argument). 

She told me not to use her shower anymore and I asked why. she told me my bathroom works just fine and I followed up with saying that her bathroom was significantly better than mine, and it makes sense for me to use the extremely nice shower when no one is home.

She says I'm invading her privacy and says ""what if I've got something in my room that I don't want you to see"" I follow that with ""we're family, and that we share the bathroom on vacations, etc."" she thinks it's not okay that I use her shower, and I cant see why it matters if I use her shower.

I know this is a first-world issue, but I'm mainly curious to see if the masses are like me and dont understand where the problem lies, or are like my mom, and think the bathroom is a personal space that shouldnt be used by others.

TL:DR - I told my mom I used her nice shower when my parents were out of town and shes telling me it's wrong for me to do so. I'm struggling to understand why it matters, and she's stating I'm invading her privacy."	No A-holes here	0	0
c76z0m	2019-06-30 00:49:48	yeahthatwasme37	AITA for breaking a kids sunglasses?	"I was a MLB game tonight. I was on the field level, in the last row. After the second inning there was a large rainstorm, and the game was delayed for around 80 minutes. After the game resumed, i moved up to around the 15th row.

If you don’t know, in between the top and bottom of the seventh inning, there is the “7th inning stretch” in which the goal is to get up and stretch. Take me out to the ballgame and other songs came on, followed by a t-shirt toss. 

There is a large net on top of the dugout in order to protect spectators from foul balls. There was a worker with a t-shirt cannon on the other side of the net, and fired one high up in the air. 

I looked up and realized the shirt was coming towards me, and got ready to catch. It was a few seats over, but got deflected so that it was exactly one row in front of me on the ground. There were no people there, so I reached down and grabbed the shirt and made sure to get it for me.

For context, I am 17m and 6’0. When i looked up with shirt in hand, a little boy looked sad he didn’t get it, so I gave it to him. However, my mother and sister got very mad at me because there was another boy that reached for the shirt, around my build and size. They both got mad because when we both lunged for the shirt, our heads hit and his sunglasses broke. 

Now I argued that it makes no sense to be mad, he shoved his head down into a scuffle with 5 other people for a t-shirt, and he brought it on himself. They say that I should have been more cautious for him, and should not have broken his glasses

c76yi0	2019-06-30 00:48:11	IntelligentTask	AITA for being a tattletale?	" 

Essentially about a week ago I had a group assignment in class where the teacher had numbered papers 1-4 and handed them out randomly so each student had a different number. I was a number a 2 and each student had to group up with another number in class. As students started finding another similar number, I was one of the last number 2's left. I found another number 2 and essentially offered to work together and he kinda shook his head at me and turned away and started walking around asking if there was anyone else he could possibly work with. I was really embarrassed at this point and so I pretty much just kinda left the room and did the assignment by myself as much as I could.

I decided I really didn't like the way I had been treated in that situation and I decided I would send the teacher an email about the situation. I didn't send the email with the intention of tattling, and didn't specify anyone's names in the email besides myself. I sent it because I was hoping the way group assignments were done could be changed in the future. I was respectful in the email and said that I felt that the way the group had been assigned in way that could invite bullying. I didn't specify that I was specifically bullied, but that it could happen in the way groups were assigned with students choosing each other's groups. I said that students avoided choosing me, and if I asked if they wanted to work with me, they would ignore me or pretend that I didn't ask them sometimes, this had happened on a few occasions.

I stuck to the facts on what had happened and did not embellish anything. My teacher got back to me today and said that I misunderstood the assignment and that the student possibly ignored me because I misunderstood the assignment, and we weren't supposed to work together. Which is fair enough. I can understand that possibly the student didn't want to work with me because of the instructions of the assignment, however, these instructions were unclear and this is not how other students were working, they were looking for corresponding numbers. A lot of the students were that I could see.

But the teacher also surprised me and said that I should understand the difference between bullying and isolation. They informed me that bullying involves aggressive behavior among school aged children (I'm an adult in college), and that there is no evidence that a power imbalance occurred, just an uncomfortable situation. They informed me to come to them if if I had information of a power imbalance. While I understood where the teacher was coming from, I was a little disheartened they didn't seem to take me seriously.

I feel that situations like this in classrooms between students should be discouraged.. Now I feel embarrassed for sending that email to the teacher. AITA for misunderstanding the assignment? Was I being over dramatic and did I jump to conclusions in being hurt? I will never send an email like that again, because it ended poorly."	Not enough info	0	0
c76xw2	2019-06-30 00:46:11	vSUNNYvSIDEvDOWNv	WIBTA if I don't take in a friend after a potential breakup?	"So I have this friend, we once hooked up when we we're teens, but since then we've both moved on to different relationships, we both live with our current partners and they know about that fling when we we're younger - no awkward feeling there, we can all talk openly about it. 


The issue is that this friend has been making moves on me (my relationship is open, his is not - they discussed it, it's still monogamous). I told him that nothing is going to happen without his partners consent when it happened the first time. It only happened once more, recently, a long time after the first incident and I just pushed his hands away and headed of to bed soon after. His advances are not intimidating or anything of that sort, just kind of a shy testing of whether my boundaries are still in place and he backs off promptly when I stop him, but the intentions are clear. I find this borderline cheating behaviour incredibly unattractive, by now the 'nothing happens without your partners consent' rule isn't even relevant anymore, I have no desire to be intimate with a person who doesn't respect their own partner and relationship. 


This was also the last time we saw each other in person a couple of months ago. He asked to hang out, I invited him over when other people were around too, several times, but he always canceled on those occasions.


Now he asked me if he can come stay with me and my partner if his relationship fails and I'm incredibly uncomfortable. However, I'm pretty much his only friend, I have a spare room and he doesn't have a great relationship with his family.

c76xkr	2019-06-30 00:45:20	canteat1411	AITA for refusing my grandmother's food?	"I normally don't eat breakfast, but when I'm living with my grandparents (in a different country), my grandmother puts breakfast out for me every day. Although I'll eat a little bit out of courtesy, every day I'll say I don't want breakfast because a) I'm not used to eating breakfast and b) I'm just not very hungry in the mornings. The other unspoken reason (which I have never ever expressed out loud) is because frankly, my grandmother is just not that good of a cook.

I just don't feel respected when I continually try to dissuade them from preparing breakfast for me and my words seem to fall on deaf ears. At the same time, it really pains me to tell them the same thing every morning and still see food on the table the following morning without fail, because I bet I'm hurting my grandparents by not eating all the food they've put out for me and for refusing breakfast. 

What really pushed me over the edge was that instead of the usual uncut fruit (which I don't feel too bad about refusing because they can just put it back in the fridge), there was clumpy oatmeal (middle still uncooked) in a bowl of slightly above room temperature milk. I just couldn't eat it, and there were 2-3 other items on the table as well. 

I don't feel comfortable saying that the food is bad, but I also don't want to hurt her feelings by not eating. Just feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Any advice on how to navigate this situation is welcome."	No A-holes here	0	0

c76wrw	2019-06-30 00:43:12	dcfb2360	AITA for feeling annoyed & taken advantage of at an internship that’s paying me way fewer hours than I actually work?	"I like my internship a lot. Coworkers and boss are cool & I like what I do. Originally I wasn’t aware I was gonna get paid, so I was psyched that I would actually make a bit of money. I’ve done unpaid internships before and doing all that work unpaid sucks. So I’m still really grateful I’m at least getting paid something. I’m also grateful just to have this position, I know how hard it is to actually get a position after applying for 300 and never hearing back from any. 

My hours are supposed to be 9-5, but I’m always there usually from 9 till anywhere from 6-7:30. I work later than 5 nearly every day. I got the first paycheck last week that was for my hours for the most recent week, and I’ve never been paid for the first 3 weeks I worked there. Today I got my second check (which again I’m very grateful for), and it was for a lot less than it should’ve been. I know I’m lucky to be getting paid, and I don’t like seeming ungrateful. But if you tell someone they’re getting paid, you’re supposed to pay them for the hours they actually work. I’ve worked some days till 8pm, 1 day till like 9:30pm. I’ve done work on holidays, and I’ve even come into work on Saturday and Sunday. I work a ton of hours, and I’m not getting paid for any of it even though I’m supposed to. 

When I got the first check I was initially kinda pissed and confused why it didn’t include the 3 weeks of work I’d done before that. That’s a lot of money. But now that I got a second check that didn’t pay me for the extra hours I worked, I’m getting kinda pissed. I’m in a tough spot where I’m an intern & I don’t want to be confrontational about not being paid what I’m supposed to, plus I also like my boss outside of this thing. We get along well and I like my job. I’m also not an idiot and I’m not gonna risk getting a bad recommendation from my boss for being underpaid at an internship that doesn’t have to pay me. (Personally I think all interns should be paid but you know what I mean).

c76veq	2019-06-30 00:39:14	Tokijlo	WIBTA for not letting someone share the Airbnb with us because they didn't pay even though the event we're attending should be more important?	"So earlier this March, it was announced that a week long protest demonstration/event will be going on in New York, in early July. Two months isn't long to prepare for a sudden trip to an expensive place so after registering for it, the organizer's sent a link to the Accommodations Hub on Facebook so that people can help each other out. Through that, I got in contact with four other activists to split the cost for an Airbnb. Due to the time crunch, I told everyone I would be more than happy to work with them (financially) since it was such short notice. Once I had everyone's dates figured out, I worked on finding us places we could all agree on and wrote up spreadsheets for them so that everyone could see the price breakdown and how it was split up. I had to do this a few times because two of the places we were looking at got rented out before we could snag them. I rented out an Airbnb, paid out of pocket, and everyone has paid their share except the person in question here. I haven't heard from her since the 15th and I'm starting to get really antsy. The other three people are staying 3 - 5 days out of the eight days booked, but the girl I haven't heard from is staying for every day that I am so she was a huge contributor.

The event is in 2 weeks. I had it worked out so that I could get a plane ticket with the money from people pitching their shares but I'm over $400 short because this girl disappeared, I have to get a loan now to afford the ticket. The text app says she hasn't seen any of my messages since the 15th so I don't know what to think. If she gets back to me and wants to work something out, I'm more than happy to work it out with her so that she can go, but WIBTA if she got back to me like the week of without the money and I didn't let her stay with us? I know the cause is what's important, I know that what matters is that we have as many bodies involved as we can. Am I being petty by not wanting her to stay with us? I feel like it's a dick move of her to lead on that she's serious about it and then totally ghost and leave me hanging with the cost."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c76v9p	2019-06-30 00:38:50	webdbw	AITA for being upset that my siblings are getting part of an inheritance but I’m not because I’m a recovering addict?	"My parents are pretty wealthy. 

I’m 26 and from 21-25 I was in and out of rehabs. I was abusing so many different kinds of drugs and I wasted so much money. I OD’d once  and it destroyed my family to watch me go through that. 

I am intensely ashamed of who I was as a person and I have been sober for almost a year. 

My parents are now approaching their late 60s and have started finalizing their wills and inheritance. 

Yesterday they sat me down and told me that I will not be getting any of the inheritance as they don’t trust me not to relapse with all that money suddenly in my possession and as a result my siblings will be getting my share of the money. 

I was pretty upset about this and I said that they were going to make my siblings rich while I would get nothing from it and that wasn’t fair. I was almost yelling at this point. 

They told me to calm down but I was too upset to listen and I left. I called my brother and sister after I left and told them what my parents said and they said that it was their choice and there wasn’t anything they could do. 

I accused them of just wanted all the money for themselves and not caring about what happened to me. 

Today I have my dad texting me that they are worried about me and “disappointed in my behaviour yesterday.” I talked to my sponsor and he said that while anger is understandable, I have to do everything in my power not to ruin the trust I’ve built with my family over the past year and acting like an asshole addict won’t help. 
Sometimes I still have trouble with my reactions to things now that I’m sober however I don’t feel as though I’m entirely unjustified here.

"So today my girlfriend and I were going to have dinner together (I'm paying) and I went to pick her up from the hospital were she was visiting his brother (new father). I asked her if she wanted to change before we go and she 
Refused because she was not going to change for a dinner that will last for 2 hours. So I insisted because I was nicely dressed and put some effort before going out, she got pissed but agreed and we drove to her place. Right now I'm downstairs waiting for her and I think I may have ruined the date but it made me feel like she didn't think a dinner with me is important enough for her to look dress nicely. 
She knew before hand we were going out, it's not fancy but still I don't like to feel like I'm not worth the effort to look pretty.

Edit to add more context

Edit 1: We went to a sushi bar. 
Edit 2: She cares about how I dress to. 

Update:  She took 45 min to get ready ( I had it coming), but the wait was worth it she was beautiful and pissed. I thank her for changing her clothes and explained how I felt, she understood and after 5 min of silence in the car everything was normal. The dinner was good, she doesn't like when I check my phone on the table so I gave it to her (hence the lack of response). I love her very much and we have been together for 8 years we love each other very much. For what is worth writing my emotions here made me realize that I had to explain myself better and so I did."

c76rq2	2019-06-30 00:29:04	_DeifyTheMachine_	AITA for calling the police on my neighbour?	"Bit of backstory, I've lived in my current flat for the past 8 months or so. During that time, my upstairs neighbour (we'll call her Amy) has had regular (if infrequent) meltdowns. I would guess about once a month.

These meltdowns can involve anything from crying to wailing to full on screaming. Usually it's just her crying to herself and whining to herself about something and is loud enough that it sounds as though its coming from the next room, but a couple of times she's had such bad meltdowns that it sounds as though something is really wrong.

The first time this happened, I ran upstairs and knocked on the door to ask what the hell was happening, to which her mother answered the door saying she was ""Just a little distressed"". I thought fine, as long as she's not dying or whatever.

So this happened about 4 or 5 more times over the course of the last 6 months. The (second) to last time, I had enough. I heard screaming, loud banging noises, enough to think she was getting beaten up. I called the police and they knocked on her door maybe 5 minutes later. I overheard in the hall, after calling one of her relatives, that she had mental issues and refused to see a doctor/get help.

Fast forward to earlier today. She was crying/wailing again and since I hadn't had an update on what exactly happened last time (though I had strong suspicions of mental issues) I proceeded to call the non-emergency number to ask for advice. They said they would send around a ""re-assurance visit"" a few hours later.

I'll be completely honest here, I partly wanted to call the police just to get it into her head that freaking her neighbours out with her meltdowns isn't really cool for harmonious living. It was jointly a noise complaint as much as being concerned.

Queue the police chatting with her at our shared doorstep. She came up and knocked on my door 5 mins later. She was visibly annoyed that I called the police twice now for what she said was ""just a few tears"" and that calling the police was just making her more stressed. I explained that I have no idea what's happening up there, and for all I know she *was* getting beaten up. I also explained that I've had to call police before for a similar incident at my old place and to be honest even she didn't cry as much as her. I apologised and closed the door on her.

She knocked again and just wanted to re-assure me that she wasn't having a go she was just saying it wasn't helping. I said fine I won't call again unless I hear something clearly wrong and apologised again.

c76q23	2019-06-30 00:24:07	ChroniKa_Green	AITA for not wanting to close my personal checking account as a term for my husband loaning me $ to pay off cc debt?	"Back story:
I grew up with money being the source of 99% of the disagreements between my parents. I knew going into marriage that I wanted to have a joint account for our household bills, and our own accounts for any remainder so there wouldn’t need to be any need for arguments.

Fast forward 12 years and my husband and I have lived like this for all of our marriage. About two years ago, we decided that it might be time to move after many disagreements with our neighbors. Myself, having $12,000 in cc debt (that I was too ashamed to admit to) did not want to move until I could tackle my debts. Yes, I know I should’ve told my husband, but I didn’t want him to be stressing about a hole I created, and I genuinely wanted to pay it off myself. I wanted to pay no more than $350k for our new home, he wanted to stretch the budget to $450k. He had a rich relative pass away and assured me that “once we get in, I’ll pay a bunch from my inheritance, and our payment won’t be so large.” We ended up moving into a house with a payment more than triple what we had been paying. Long story short...we have new siding and paint for the house, as well as a custom bmw for him from his inheritance but our mortgage remains the same.

I continued to struggle to pay the debts and the interest kept rising with my much lower allowance, but overall I was happy. Last month, hubby decides its time to refinance and finds out that my debts have grown to $25k. He flips his lid, I apologize, yada yada....I sold my car that I loved to pay off more than half (down to $10k in debt) and bought a shitty junker to get me to and from work while I pay off the rest.

Earlier this week, hubby tells me he’s got a deal for me: he will pay off what remains of my debt (as he still has at least $20k in savings still) and I can make payments to him  to avoid interest fees, but I have to get rid of my personal checking account. I feel like he wants to control every aspect of our money even though I make way more than him just because maybe we don’t agree on needed purchases for the house. I also feel like he’s stepping in as “my savior “ as he keeps making comments about how he has to bail me out again...it just makes me feel like worthless garbage.

At the beginning of the summer I planned to work the same amount so I could help out at home where my mom runs a child care/preschool. Today my grandparents told me that I’m not working enough and should be working closer to 30-35 hours a week rather than the same two 6 hour shifts I’ve been doing during the school year because it is summer, I told them that I’d rather keep working the same shifts because I want to actually have time to both help my mom out and actually have Time to hang out with friends, but they said that that is absurd and that I’m just a lazy failure, and my older brother(19) agrees with them and has just repeated that I need to tell them that I want more hours. I’ve talked about it with many of my friends my age who all told me that I’m in the right here wanting less hours and that having more than 20 is completely absurd in their opinions, but when I mentioned that to my grandparents they just said that back when they were younger that they worked since middle school and just yelled at me about it somehow leading to saying that DACA is ruining America and that it’s somehow my fault. So now I’m feeling like crap and wondering if I’m actually just somehow blind to this apparent need to work more.

I just went in and hung it up on the door hook. He pokes his head out and I say “I’m doing laundry so I wanted to make sure you had a towel.” He said “You really need to tell me when you’re coming in, like at least knock.” But he said it super rude and like I was so out of line to not knock? 

So for additional context, we take a shower together probably 75% of the time. We’ve been together a year and a half. 

Idk why he would be mad when we shower together most of the time. It’s not like I would’ve seen anything new. Maybe he thought I could’ve walked in when he was pooping or something?

This happened a pretty long time ago but basically in 4th grade me and like 3 of my friends had an idea to host Nerf Hunger Games matches on the weekends. I won’t go into specifics but it was always fun and each round lasted about three hours with sometimes thirty people coming out. This was because of how big the playground and the field was.


So we were looking to expand the event to see if there were more people interested as we did not want anyone to miss out if they wanted to go. 

Anyway there was basically a sign up sheet in our class room that was easily accessible because all the classrooms are open and most of the teachers did not care. This is how we would estimate who would go and how much stuff to bring. 

One day out sign was in the trash because some girls told on us to get the sign taken down so they could put up their play or some shit. Me and about five people saw this and went over there and sort of ranted about how it was a scum thing to do and a lot of people were going to be sad about this.  

I and a few others basically said how no one cared about their play and that if they wanted to advertise it they could of put it somewhere else and apparently one of them heard and then told on us.

c76kpw	2019-06-30 00:10:01	galiyleo	AITA for getting a memorial tattoo of my grandmother but not my grandfather?	"This took place a little while ago but it's been weighing on me ever since it happened. 

In October of 2017, my mom's dad passed away after a battle with lung cancer. It was incredibly painful and hard on everyone in my family. My siblings and I used common but unhealthy coping mechanisms and it was all around a pretty shitty time. 

Then, in January of 2018, my dad's mom passed from complications having to do with a massive stroke she'd had in the spring of 2017. It was equally as shitty as my maternal grandfather passing but it was also more sudden and it hit me super hard, as I was extremely close to her. I was close to my maternal grandfather as well but my paternal grandmother was probably my best friend. She was even helping me pay for school.

After my paternal grandma's funeral, my dad gave me and my siblings a bit of money that he'd gotten from the collection cards (? I'm not really positive what they're called) from the funeral. I didn't feel right using this money on anything for myself because of how I'd gotten it, but my sister came up with the idea to add a memorial ""section"" to her half sleeve (tattoo). I liked this idea so we got matching tattoos in her memory. I used the money from the funeral to pay for this tattoo. 

A few weeks after getting my tattoo done, I visited my mom's house and she took notice of it and told me it was a nice tattoo, but a few minutes-an hour after that, she made the comment ""nothing for (nickname we call her dad), huh?"" I was taken aback by this and didn't respond but I texted my sister about it after and she was surprised as well. To be honest, it kind of hurt my feelings. I absolutely do have plans to get a memorial tattoo for my maternal grandfather but I haven't had the money (I'm a student). I probably wouldn't have even gotten this tattoo if I didn't receive the funeral money from my dad either. Not at the time I did, anyway.

I’m an overly nice person and have anxiety when I have to stand up for myself at times...apart from the fact that she noticed I’m OBVIOUSLY uncomfortable with the way she handles my baby, however she tells me he’s fine and continues to throw him around and pinch his cheeks too hard and switch him from multiple positions and force his binky into his mouth so he doesn’t cry even if he doesn’t want it. All the while she’s laughing while doing this because she finds his startled faces cute/ funny. 
Last time she saw him she even said “I would be a mess as a young mom if I saw anyone treating my baby this way you’re just nice to me” 

If she acknowledges this why wouldn’t she just stop and respect that? I’ve told my SO about it and he says that she has a lot of experience and he’s fine but I’m simply not comfortable with it.  I told him I wouldn’t allow her to see him until she can stop throwing him around like a football and he thinks I’m over exaggerating.

c76jyd	2019-06-30 00:08:04	Wild_Ruin	AITA for indirectly causing my friend's parents to get a divorce?	"So I'm 18 and one of my girlfriends is 20. We met around three years ago and we have mutual friends though we're not super close.

She was asking me two weeks ago how to make more money over summer when business hours are apparently slower, and so I jokingly suggested she get a sugar daddy.

I figured she would know I was joking but she didn't, and so she joined one of those websites where you get legit sugar daddies. Apparently the night she did, she found her *dad* on the website and got all weirded out.

The next morning she told her mother and long story short, they're getting a divorce as of two days ago. All three of them are really upset about it. My friend told me all of this last night, where she also said that we can't be friends anymore in a very hostile manner.

I told her she shouldn't be mad at me because if I hadn't suggested getting a sugar daddy her father would still be cheating on her mother unbeknownst to anyone. She didn't respond and has blocked me on all social media platforms.

I feel guilty, spooked, and generally terrible about the whole thing. But at the same time I don't think it's my fault; I didn't think my friend was actually gonna try and get a sugar daddy, and it's not my fault she found her dad on there cheating, causing a divorce, neither of which is my fault either.

c76j9q	2019-06-30 00:05:57	NotRedRobinTA	AITA for asking another party at a restaurant to make their conversation more appropriate?	"This happened on Thursday, but I just told my SO about it, and he thinks I was out of bounds. 

I took my daughter, her friend, and 2 of my nephews to a restaurant for lunch. They range in ages 3-10.  I'm a teacher, so I'm the one with the kids a lot during summer. It's a lot of fun. Anyway, we all went to a restaurant that had a kids meal for super cheap. We sat at a table by the window. It was between lunch and dinner, so there were only a few tables occupied. For those who don't know, restaurants like to keep their occupied tables close during slow times because they only had one server working. (this is important)

The table right next to us was a group of college aged kids. They were a little rowdy but it was kinda fun to be around their energy. Their noise didn't bother me at all. A few minutes after we got there, one of the girls at that table said something about wanting to break up with her boyfriend. They talked a bit and then it got totally crude. They were talking about their sex life in a very loud volume. The friends were giving advice and asking questions. They were drinking and getting more comfortable with their conversation. I felt a little weird about all my kids hearing it, but we all pretended like we couldn't. It got more vulgar and I finally snapped when the first girl said ""I won't suck dick anymore but we can 69 all day long."" Yes, in those exact words. 

I put the oldest kid in charge and said I was using the restroom. I stopped at their table and whispered something like ""I know you're all here for good food and good company, but I've got a lot of kids right there. Do you mind either being quieter or using more euphemisms?"" 

So they all looked at me in surprise and minor embarrassment. I could tell they were having fun and not realizing their surroundings. I get it. I didn't blame them at all. I went to the restroom and came back quickly. Their conversation was dulled for the rest of their meal. Really quiet. They left shortly after. 

I didn't mean to ruin their time. It was family restaurant similar to Applebee's or Red Robin. There was a full bar on the opposite side where they could have sat and no kids around. 

So, am I the asshole here?

Edit: I want to clarify that I'm by no means a prude. If it were at a bar with my SO, we probably would have joined them for a laugh. My only problem was the time and the place. Had they been in the bar, I wouldn't have said anything.

Edit2: this is a small town of about 9,000 people. The nearest city is about a 30 minute drive. This is not a big chain restaurant, but very much designed like them in menu. There are no TVs or those tabletop tablet things (other than in the bar). I only chose it because on Thursday they have 1.99 kids meals until 8 pm."	No A-holes here	0	0

c76grs	2019-06-29 23:58:49	neverthebridesmaid	AITA because I don’t want to be in a wedding?	"Let me rewind just a little. In 2012, I was a bridesmaid in my best friend's wedding. It was a beautiful day and she had a great time but all of the turmoil leading up to the wedding made me realize I NEVER want to be in a bridal party again. There was no maid of honor (I was later told it would have been the MOH but she didn’t want to hurt a family member’s feelings) and each of the 6 women thought they knew better than the others, myself included. I can’t imagine it was peaches and cream for anyone else, either.

Regardless, all of my to-be-married friends have been very aware of these feelings for the past 7 years.

Another one of my best friends has been engaged for 11 years and finally, this year, has set a date. She texted me about a month ago and said “So I know you never wanted to do that again. Did you really mean that or are you open to the idea?” Because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings and I was seeing her a few days later I told her we could talk about it.

I stated my case, as unchanged for 7 years. I offered to be there for her for whatever she needs but that, yes I really meant it and even though I appreciate the offer, I declined being IN her wedding. My cousin, her fiancé, tried to pressure me into it by saying the bridal vs groom side would be uneven. I apologized again and said no thank you.

During the conversation, she said she knew the answer was no and wasn’t going to ask but my mom had insisted. She said that it was okay and then I thought we were all good.

Five days ago, I was out to dinner with her and the topic came up again. She told me that I should push my feelings aside and not be selfish because I’m her best friend and I should be in the wedding. I, again, apologized and said no thank you, stating my case. She told me I need to grow up and deal with it. I didn’t want to fight while we were out and I explained my position again. The conversation ended and it hasn’t been brought up again, yet.

I feel like when you ask someone to be in your wedding... you’re asking... that means that person can always say no, for whatever reason.

AITA??

c76fpg	2019-06-29 23:56:05	TheGamerTrainer	AITA for still being upset	"Today my mom had to take me to Urgent Care because I had an infection. I won't go into detail but I'm on antibiotics now. Well while my mom was explaining the problem to my dad he kept asking if I had a fever. I didn't so he said then wait till Monday to see my regular doctor because it didn't seem serious. He knows nothing about medical care so how does he have the right to say if I need to wait or not, waiting til I had a fever means it has gotten very bad. Sure I got the antibiotics and everything but I feel so for lack of a better word betrayed and hurt.

He will never apologize for what he said and I'm just supposed to move out of this whole thing? I always say he doesn't care about me and this just confirmed it. He does crap to me all the time and I'm just supposed to forgive. I can't do that anymore 

My mom keeps telling me I'll drive other people away if I keep acting like this but all of this anger is from everything my dad has done. I try to be as forgiving as possible but he just keeps pushing it. I'm still pretty upset about the whole ordeal so

Edit: sorry this is unclear to make things easier it was a UTI and yes I did get treatment

There's been several discussions amongst my mom and her brothers about how EVERYONE needs to pitch in to help check in on my grandparents, see if my grandma needs help with errands and chores, things like that.

My grandpa's last visit to the hospital was Tuesday. Thursday night, he went to my uncle's birthday party. Today (Saturday) my mom and grandma decided to go to lunch and Walmart, and my grandpa wanted to go along. So he did.

After their errands, he was having trouble getting out of the car and seemed confused. Being afraid he may be having a stroke, they called 911. His BP was super low, so the paramedics went ahead and transported him to the hospital.

When my mom texted her brothers to let them know, they got rather harsh with her, saying that he shouldn't have been going out and she should've made sure he stayed home resting.

This made me really mad, because it is not my mom's responsibility to tell him what to do. If he wanted to go out and he felt fine, then he should do just that! My mom feels guilty, and I'm furious with my uncles for making her feel that way.

c76ci3	2019-06-29 23:47:33	SeatBeltThrowaway468	AITA for not disabling the seatbelt alarm in our car?	"My partner has a thing about seatbelts, I think it stems from his PTSD and not wanting to be bound, which comes from some messed up stuff in his childhood. Not that a belt would have helped the way it happened, but he even had a fiancé that died in a wreck.

We got a new car a few years ago, one that has a seatbelt alarm, he hates it, sometimes he wears it, sometimes he puts it around the back of the seat and buckled it so it doesn’t go off.

He asked me a year ago to disable the alarm, I looked into it, but the only way would be to short out the switch in the buckle, this COULD cause the passenger airbag to go off with him too close to the bag to be safe, furthermore the bag could go off if there is cargo in the front seat.

I tried to drop it after finding there is no good way to do it,but it just came up again, I told him I didn’t want to do it and he’s pretty upset.

I think it’s crap that you can’t turn it off, I really do, and I am a good defensive driver, but that’s not going to stop someone else from running a red or drifting from an oncoming lane, and I don’t want some series of events to end with him hurt or dead when I’m fine because the bag and belt worked as intended.

I drive 99% of the time and I think this is going to have some fallout if I don’t do it, or refuse and make him do it, so it’s not on me, but I feel it’s still on me driving knowing the passenger side is modified.

Am I the asshole for not wanting it to be on me if something where to happen? Or should I respect his preference to ride without a belt?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c76a95	2019-06-29 23:41:32	toww3211	AITA for not telling my grown son and daughter that they have a younger brother that they don't know about?	"After divorcing the mother of my children, I briefly dated a woman and broke up. After the break-up, she informed me that she was pregnant. I told her that I had a lot on my plate and had no intention of being involved with this child's upbringing. We didn't talk until she informed me that she had given birth to a son, we'll cal him A. I was already moved on from her and had a lot on my plate and told her that. She was quite angry and threatened to take me to court, so we agreed that I would pay child support for him until he was 18. A kept his mothers last name.

we met at my house once about 9 months later with her, A, and her friend. This was the only time that I met A. I held him and looked at this baby and honestly felt no emotional connection to him. This was not my son. I was not his father

A's mother called me once when he was about 3/4 years old and told me that A wanted to meet me and was asking questions about me. I explained to her that I was not willing to do this and had moved on. This was 19 years ago and I haven't thought of them really since and have not told anyone in my family of this.

About 3 weeks ago, A called me. He explained that he didn't feel animosity towards me but wanted to meet me. I hesitantly obliged and agreed to meet him the next week for lunch.

Last week I met A at a restaurant. The second he walked in I recognized him immediately, he looked just like his bother and just like me; tall, slim, short blonde hair, well dressed. I stood up and shook his hand for the first time and looked him in the eye. After greeting each other and making small talk, I started asking about him and was quite impressed. He was 22 years old, an air force pilot who had spent a year travelling north Africa and southeast Asia after high school. I asked about his mother and he asked about me and my side of his bloodline. When the conversation got to my children it became quite tense. He already knew that I had a son (29) and a daughter (32) but asked if they knew about him. I explained that they had no idea that he existed as did the rest of my family. I could see he was disappointed on hearing this. We finished our lunch and agreed to keep in touch. We shook hands and he called me by my first name. During the drive home, I was feeling a bit sad that I had missed out on this boys life.

Throughout the past week I've been really thinking and decided that I want to tell my son and daughter about their brother. I feel that they would be happy with this sort of news but am worried if they'll feel resentment towards me. My mother and siblings have no idea about him either and I feel like they would inevitably find out. What if they accept him and cast away me? will they resent him?

I'm at a loss for how to tell my children that they have a brother they never knew. I feel that they have the right to know and that A has a right to meet his own siblings.

He texted me a month ago and asked if I was willing to cohabitate for a while, you see I am currently working with a realtor to find a house and I mentioned that to my family on memorial day. He wants to take over my lease when I move out. The problem is that I don't know when I'll find a house. So if I let him move in it'll be for a while.( Longer than a few months) He has said he has plans to get his shit together, but I have a hard time believing that, given his track record for making poor financial decisions. He currently owns two vehicles that are in disrepair and works two part time jobs. I have asked why he doesn't find full time work, and he claims he can't. I find this hard to believe based on his resume,( Navy vet, with no criminal record and no large gaps in employment) and the fact that my state has a skilled labor shortage. We both have worked in industrial maintenance and I know that the demand is ridiculously high. Now I know he's fallen on hard times and he needs help but I have had roommates in the past and I have worked my ass off to get into a position where I wouldn't have to have a roommate ever again.

c765h3	2019-06-29 23:28:21		AITA for being mad at my boyfriend for not showing up to a family lunch?	"Me and my bf are both 21 and have been dating for 2 years now. Aside from my parents and sister, all of my relatives live in another state, including an aunt that has always been very special to me. We see each other every year, when we travel to that state, but after almost ten years my aunt decided to visit us at home. All of us were excited, of course. 

I told my bf about it, and we invited him over to lunch today as we do sometimes. He knows how much I love my aunt, and I’ve told him multiple times how sweet she is. He is quite shy, but he accepted the offer and even said he was also excited to meet her (she’s been so eager to know him, since I’m her first niece and he’s my first boyfriend). Okay, so I messaged him yesterday to confirm his presence and he said “of course I’m going”, and I also let him know my mom put extra meat on the dish because she knows he likes it. 

On weekends, we usually have lunch around 1 or 2PM. I slept until midday and missed his messages at 10AM, and them at 12PM. In the first one he said good morning baby and etcetera and in the second one he asked me “u awake?” and then 10min later he said “sorry, I’ll have to have lunch, will go to your house later”. Like??? You HAVE to have lunch? I mean, of course he should eat if he’s hungry, but for what reason would he NEED to have lunch at that time instead of eating something and then coming to lunch? I told him he should come to eat anyways, even if just a little, and we would welcome him any time of the day. So I’m already pissed off. Then time goes by, the table set with only his plate on it because my aunt insisted he would like to eat when he gets here, and my mom was a little sad he didn’t show up. My aunt leaves tomorrow. 

Right now it’s 7PM and he just asked me if I’m going to his place. My parents and aunt are dining out with some friends tonight. I didn’t reply to his message yet because I’m mad at him. If he didn’t want to come because he was embarrassed, he could have fucking said it. He has done it before (at my mom’s birthday dinner, where there’d be a lot of her friends, obviously), and everyone understood it and was nice about it. 

My dad said I shouldn’t be sad because I should’ve texted him earlier and tell him to come over, but I didn’t because I honestly thought he would and eventually I got caught up on college assignments. AITA for being mad at him? WIBTA if I tell him this tonight?"		1	0

"My girlfriend wants to earn a little extra cash on a sugar daddy app. I have told her that I feel extremely uncomfortable with creepy men looking at her photos and sexualizing them while she also humours conversations with them which can lead to dirty talk. Her photos would be of her in ‘going out’ wear, with revealing and tight clothing. She said if they ask for dirtier or more private photos she will say no. In these apps it is typical for men to not give any money unless you at least tease a sexual request. At first she may say no but I feel that she could be offered tempting offers that she would find hard to decline.

I am aware that there needs to be trust issues there that she wouldn’t, but even without the potential of dirty photos, I am very uncomfortable with her essentially sexting creepy guys who will know what she looks like and getting arousal from her photos. It makes me sick to think about her partaking in this activity. She says it is her choice and it’s not a crime. She is making me out to be controlling when I really just don’t want her talking in explicit ways with other men. It makes me feel sick and it is quite hurtful that she hasn’t taken how I feel into account. Some people would count it as cheating and I’m not entirely sure if it’s right. I understand she will be sexualised by creeps no matter what, but the fact she is humoring them by having conversations and talking dirty back is something I don’t think is right in the relationship we have. She has said we will just have to disagree on the matter and that she can do what she chooses. I have made it clear that I am uncomfortable with it and it hurts me that she doesn’t care about how I feel about it. So guys, am I the asshole?"	No A-holes here	0	0

c764s3	2019-06-29 23:26:27	therealjackio	AITA for cancelling on 60 people?	"For some context, I am a teenager that just finished school and will soon be going to university.

My parents are currently on holiday and me and my friend (who we will call Mark) decided that, despite my parents' wishes, we were going to invite around 60 people to a party at mine to celebrate the end of school. I thought my house would be a mess by the end of it, but that no serious damage would be done. 

The day before the party was supposed to take place I invited Mark over to plan the party, as well as try out a new bong that I had bought in preparation.  An hour before Mark arrived he asked if one of his friends could come as well. I said yes. Mark, his friend and I sat around my house smoking and laughing. Mark asked if it was okay if another of his friends came and I agreed.

About 10 minutes later Mark's friend and 6 other people, 2 of which I have almost never spoken to just walked in. As in they literally, just let themselves in because i hadn't thought to lock the door. I also hadn't given any of them my address and would have said no to most of them coming.

They weren't aggressive in any way but they started rifling through my drawers, smoking without asking and acting like the house was theirs. They asked if they could smoke outside and I flat out said no because my next door neighbours were all in there gardens and I knew that sitting outside smoking out of a bong wouldn't go down well. I went upstairs briefly and when I came back down half of them were outside and the other half were talking about how great the party was going to be and how fucked up my house was going to get (these were the people I barely knew and weren't even invited.)  I started to realise what the party would actually be like and told everyone to leave. Almost all of them could see that I was pissed, knew how disrespectful they had been and left straight away but one of them, I basically had to push out my house because he ""wanted to get a better hit"".

After this, I started to seriously reconsider the party. I felt it had gotten too big and there were too many people coming who I just could not trust to not break anything or let in people who I didn't want there. I waited until I had sobered up then I messaged everyone telling them it was off.

Since this has happened some people have been understanding while others have been desperately messaging me to have it anyway, as well as some subtle insults over Twitter. At this point, I couldn't believe how some people were acting and it became apparent that a few just wanted a 'Project X' style fiasco. Despite knowing that this was the case I couldn't help feeling like the villain for telling everyone it was off, and I am still devastated that my high school legacy will be the guy that cancelled the gaff of the century 24hrs before it was supposed to start. I probably could have still had people over if I dramatically shortened the list but honestly my heart just was not in it anymore.

I completely forgot about the rule about not placing it directly by the computer, and placed a cup of water there. My mom accidentally knocks said cup of water over as I was getting ready for bed/going to the bathroom (I heard the whole thing. I wanted to help her, but as I mentioned, I was on the toilet and couldn't move).

Later, I'm washing my face, and she stands next to me and says ""You're not going to say I'm sorry?""

I was confused, so I was like ""I was following the rules you made. I figured it was an accident.""

She got angry and told me that I shouldn't have placed it directly next to the computer. I realized my mistake, and went ""Oh, that's my bad.""

She shook her head and said ""I remembered when you had a soul.""

Obviously, the comment really stung, so she went ""Just kidding!"" and gave me a sideways hug while giving a half-hearted chuckle before slamming the door shut behind her. I wasn't laughing, nor did I hug her back, because I was hurt and I knew she wasn't just joking when she said that (she has a habit of saying mean stuff or saying guilt trips and covering it up with ""I was just joking."" I can normally tell when she's genuinely joking around vs. being passive aggressive).

I started thinking about it more. Was I somehow being rude by saying ""my bad"" instead of ""sorry?"" I figured they were pretty much synonymous, but maybe my mom misunderstood me and that's why she reacted the way she did. I honestly wasn't trying to be mean or rude, but I can see why it could have been perceived that way. I did mess up with the whole cup of water thing. I completely forgot about that specific rule, and I feel terrible for it. (Also, the computer is okay btw). AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: I got a wide variety of answers, but it seems like the majority rule is ESH. What I'm getting here is that ""my bad"" isn't really an apology, so I'll apologize more properly to my mom as soon as I can. Thanks for your answers, guys!

Edit #2: I apologized. She said she never misunderstood me and barely remembered that it happened, but she was grateful that I tried to make things right regardless."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c763se	2019-06-29 23:23:50	snakrad	AITA for not wanting to christen my son?	"My wife Lucy is pregnant with our first baby, a boy. We are delighted and very excited. There is one issue that has come between us. 

I was born and raised in the UK, but am of arabic descent, and was raised in a very religious, traditional, conservative muslim household. As a nonreligious adult I wouldn't wish that kind of upbringing on any child and always dreamed of raising a child free of religion and tradition.  There are numerous things that are done to babies in my family that I wouldn't dare to do. Boys are circumcised (religious ritual) and girls get their ears pierced (cultural practice). I would never do either of these things and would not want religion having any part in my child's life. 

Lucy is white english and not religious in any way and nor is anyone in her family, in spite of this it's still a family tradition to have babies christen. I objected to this as soon as it was brought up, because I don't want any kind of religious ceremony being done to my child. If it's what they want then of course they can choose it for themselves later in life, but it's not something we should choose to do for them. 

Lucy argued that it's nothing to do with religion and that's it's just a family tradition which every baby has done. She also rightfully pointed out that unlike circumcision/ear piercing, it's not painful for the baby. I understand all of this, but it's still a *religious ritual*. 

Lucy has said that if I feel so strongly then we won't have a christening, but understandably has been very down about it. To be honest seeing how upset she is I'm considering just putting my views aside to make her happy. I just want to know if having those views is justified."	No A-holes here	0	0

I was driving to my daughters (24f) graduation when I got a phone call from my husband, my son (16m) had ingested 4 bottles of pills and was now in an ambulance on his way to the hospital. I knew I had to see my son so I called my daughter and explained that I could not make it, I did not explain why as I did not want to worry her just before the graduation. 

I thought that I could visit the hospital and mabey make it back to the graduation in time but I was unable to. 

after her graduation ended she called me quite angrily and demanded I tell her why I missed her most important day, I explained that her younger brother was in the hospital recovering from ingesting pills. I apologized profusely and said that I would take her to a fancy graduation dinner later on. 

that was some how not good enough and I was hung up on. she has now stopped talking to me because she is incredibly hurt that I missed her huge day and thinks that I dont love her. 

my husband was getting ready to drive to the graduation when he found our son so was also unable to go. he never got the chance to tell her as his head was not in the right place. 
she has also stopped talking to him.

Grace has something going on with Jack (early 40s) who’s our boss’s right hand man. (Jack will close his office door and you can hear... stuff going on.) 

Long story short, Grace is not very good at her job, but Jack is making sure she gets a lot more authority, which coupled with her incompetence/inexperience really puts a monkey wrench in the machinery. 
Three years ago Grace was a cocktail waitress; Will got her a good job, a green card, and has sent her three kids to a good school. 


Several of us team leads feel like Grace is trying to undermine us; we heard her falsely tell another director that *she* was team lead for X group.  To note, I’m a bit younger than Grace, but have worked a lot longer in this field; she was really pissed when I was made team lead.

We used to be kind of friendly, which is how I know that she and Will are trying for a baby.

c761k6	2019-06-29 23:18:04	remarriedwill	AITA for not including my new wife in my will?	"Long story short. My first wife died and I inherited money from her estate. We had one child who is now an adult. I have recently remarried. My will right now is set up so my daughter inherits everything. My wife wants me to include her but I still feel like I want my daughter to inherit everything. Partially because a portion of this money is from her late mother.

&#x200B;

Edit: Been with the wife for about 3 years total. Married 6 months, The money my wife left was substantial I invested it and its grown a lot so whats there now is MUCH larger then what she initially left. All my death expenses will be covered by my life insurance and out of that account so no one will be left footing those bills

&#x200B;

Edit 2: The main contention is over an account thats now 7 figures that started with the money my late wife left. What I have earned and will earn is not yet decided.

&#x200B;

Edit 3: New wife is currently a beneficiary of my life insurance policy. I may include her in what remains in my 401k and Ira accounts. The house (which was bought with my late wife and paid off by me, and the account my late wife set up, is together over 3/4 of my entire estate. What I have is not insignificant but nowhere near as substantial as those other two assets both of which were from my wife and long predated the marriage (and neither of which is considered marital property)

&#x200B;

Edit 4 a large portion of this money came from a wrongful death settlement. She DIED for this money. I will make sure her daughter gets it.

&#x200B;

Edit 5 The will covers the assets that were created with my late wife. The house and the proceeds of the wrongful death settlement. Currently the state will split the other assets. They are not in contention. Its the multi million dollar account and the million dollar house that are in contention.

&#x200B;

Edit 6 I was trying to keep things vague and not get into specifics but you all want specifics so here it is.

Late wifes account 5.5 million dollars goes to my daughter

House we bought now worth 1.2 million dollars goes to my daughter

My insurance, 401k, Ira all combined currently sits at 1.6 million dollars split between wife and daughter by the state not covered in will. Wife wants half of EVERYTHING. because thats a lot more money then my own personal assets. The money came from a wrongful death settlement. That money came from my wifes fucking death. Something I really didnt want to talk about. She DIED for it. No I dont want to see someone else profiting off of my late wifes death. That money belongs to her daughter. I didnt even touch it and use it for myself. I put it all away for my daughter"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c760sq	2019-06-29 23:16:03	YeetYeetThrowawayYee	"AITA for insulting my roommate's GF after he said my GF looks like a ""camgirl"""	"So I go to school out of state and have a couple of roommates. One of which I have been living with for several years and had been pretty much best friends until we had sort of a falling out over the past couple of months. We're still mostly cordial with each other, but our relationship just isn't what it used to be. He also has had a GF for the past several years, she's our age but she does kind of look pretty young for her age.

While I was back home away from school for about 2 months I started seeing a girl who is absolutely awesome and gorgeous and honestly makes my day better every day I get to see her. So once I moved back to school I obviously talk about her pretty often.

So the other day I have a friend over and we're talking about her and he asks if he could see a picture of her just so he could put a name to the face. So I pull up her instagram and show it to him. My roommate who was in the room asks if he could too, I say sure and he looks at it for a couple seconds, then gives me back my phone and says ""She looks like a camgirl"" while I can see it may have been a compliment in some backhanded way, to me though it felt like he was saying ""she looks slutty"" 

So I returned with ""You look like you're sleeping with a 14 year old"" to which he gets in my face calling me all kinds of names for coming at him like that and how I was out of line. I said my piece about how I interpreted what he said about my GF but he wasn't hearing it and demanding I apologize.

While I can see it may have been an overreaction for me to get upset by what he said, but he could have said a lot of different things and he didn't make any effort to take it back even after I explained, so I don't feel any reason to take back what I said.

He’s so pure, he doesn’t party, drink, do drugs none of that but he’s still so much fun without it. He’s really happy go lucky and pretty extroverted. I married him because I fell in love with him and I wanted to lead a life like him. But recently I’ve fallen back with my old friends from my partying/drinking days and I’ve got sucked back in. I want to get drunk with a few friends sometimes, I really do miss that time. I’m still pretty young (25) but my husband isn’t about that life and he doesn’t love the idea of me being out with friends (both male and female) getting drunk. 

On a couple of occasions I’ve gone out and got drunk with some friends but never told him. He thinks we just grabbed some dinner and I know he’d be pretty disappointed if he found out I’d been out drinking at a bar instead, let alone lied about it. But I just feel like I wanna feel like I’m 18 again. I have an otherwise pretty mundane life but on the odd occasion I just wanna let loose. I’ve been justifying it to myself by saying he doesn’t HAVE to know everything in my life. I’m not cheating or being unfaithful, its a little fun with some pals.

Bit of back story: I have had some history with F as I also had a bit of a thing for her which M knew about.

It was abundantly clear that he had a massive crush on her and syas that she was very forward with him. The two of them were chatting for some considerable time alone but nothing physical happened. F is generally quite a flirty and touchy-feely person so I let M know that this is just how she is and not to read too much into this.

I see him regularly at the gym so he always give me little updates on how much they message. I touch base with F to see the craic and she says they message but he is being very full on to the point where she is made to feel a little uncomfortable. She says she doesn't want to lead him on but she doesn't want to be mean to him. I tell her if she wants me to have a word with M to let me know, she can. To which she tells me that if he doesn't calm down then she will get in touch. 

She messages me the following day saying that M has invited has invited F to a track day and that she is planning on going with a friend. The day comes, the friend bails and she ends up going on her own. She tells me she has a lot of fun. I catch up with M and he tells me the two were very cuddly. I try to explain that she generally is like this. I have literally been in the exact same position and then some more.

I honestly don't feel comfortable with this, in my eyes M is effectively making a move on a girl I very openly had feelings for. M relays his messages and feelings towards F in the exact same way I relayed them to a friend when I was in his position. So I have tried as politely as possible to steer him away. I am meeting with F this week to discuss what is going on because if things were to progress with M and F I don't think I could be friends with them.

c75zlb	2019-06-29 23:12:56		WIBTA if I threw out a rotting egg?	"In early 2018 my mother decided to start raising chickens for eggs. She raised them as baby chicks and had them for about 6 months before there was a fire and they all died. They died in October of last year. We still had a few dozen eggs left after they died, since some of them would even lay multiple a day, and we don’t even use eggs all that often.

Well my mother has used up all of the eggs, except for one. She absolutely refused to use this one because it was the last egg. I have tried very much to be sympathetic towards her situation, but it’s gotten to the point where I believe she really needs to move on. She long surpassed the chance to honour the chicken’s memory by using the egg, now it’s completely rotten. Eggs last about 6 months, it went bad 2 months ago.

It is to the point the egg has made the entire fridge, kitchen, and living area of the house smells like rotting eggs. With the summer heat starting up it’s gotten even worse, I gag every time I have to go near the fridge and everything inside tastes awful. The smell is attracting an extreme amount of bugs and mice and now there is a full blown infestation in the house.

It’s absolutely disgusting and I just want this egg gone. I understand the sentimental value but this is far too much and she really needs to move on. She’s spent more time grieving over these chickens than she grieved over her own child who died as a kid. She still cries every night over these chickens, and becomes extremely aggressive whenever I suggest getting rid of the egg or seeking therapy. This is far too extreme and it’s becoming a health hazard.

So would I be the asshole if I just threw the damn egg away? She herself has said, and I quote “it’s not trash and I will never throw it away” and clearly means it, even threatening to kick me from our home (I’m 16) if I do it. But it’s got to be done and I’m desperate to breathe in my own house again."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c75zhq	2019-06-29 23:12:39	catladywithallergies	AITA for physically removing a tourist’s hands off an Ancient Greek statue?	"As an art history major, one of the things that really makes my blood boil is when people touch statues when they are explicitly told not to do so and do not have the proper equipment needed to handle them. The main reason why you should never touch the statues (unless otherwise posted) is that the oil from hands actually wears down the material. When I was at the Louvre today, I saw this Chinese tourist grabbing an Ancient Greek statue dating from the Late Hellenistic era (c. 323-31 BCE) by the finger while her husband was trying to take a picture. Completely out of my instincts, I actually (gently) took the woman’s hands off the statue and very sternly told her not to touch the statues. 
 
While that gallery was a loud madhouse, was I being an asshole for taking the woman’s hand off the statue?

Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses! It was interesting and eye-opening to see a whole range of different opinions here. Since many took issue to the fact I made physical contact with the tourist, I will try to refrain from doing so in the future and talk to them first. However, my passion and drive to preserve art for future generations is still as strong as ever."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c75z7y	2019-06-29 23:12:03	bdaythrwy	AITA for wanting a birthday cake I could eat?	"This happened last year but it crosses my mind a lot. 

&#x200B;

Background: There are 4 of us in my group of friends - let's call them H, T, and M.  They've been my best friends for 5+ years. My birthday and T's birthday are both in December. I am lactose intolerant, which is central to the story. 

&#x200B;

We all got together last year at H's place for a holiday hangout, and H surprised me and T with a joint birthday celebration! She had balloons and decorations set up for us and said she got us a special cake too. After dinner, H pulled out a mango mousse cake from the fridge. My heart kind of sank when I saw it. I told H that I probably wouldn't be able to eat it since the mousse is made with heavy cream...She said ""Yeah, I thought about that when I was getting it, but I knew T is really picky and I thought this would be something she likes!"" I appreciated that H went through the effort of getting us a cake and it wasn't just for my birthday, so I didn't say anything else about it. They sang happy birthday to us and we blew out the candles, but I just sat there as everyone else had cake. They kept asking me if I was sure I didn't want any and I told them yes, I was sure it would give me a stomach ache. At the end of the night, H offered to give me the rest of the cake to bring home and suggested I could just take Lactaid pills for it. I declined because Lactaid pills are not super effective for me and I don't like buying something extra when I can just avoid the foods that give me pain. 

&#x200B;

I felt pretty bummed on the way home. T is a very picky eater and doesn't like a lot of flavors, but I feel like a regular birthday cake would have been fine for her and I also would have been able to eat it. But I understand that the mousse cake was more special than a regular cake and H wanted to give us something special, so I feel like maybe I was being selfish and ungrateful in only thinking about me.

"Hello, I (28M) told my wife (26F) last night that I was not interested in attending a small get together for her father at his home today. She only finalized these plans less than 24hr before. I offered to help execute (and pay) for this gathering of approx 8 family members.
Approximately 3 months ago I had a conflict with my father in law, in regards to allowing my wife, his daughter to attempt to drive home, from his home absolutely Trashed last one night. TLDR: She was supposed to stop by his house one day quickly, both of them ended up hammered and she was wasted and her dad let her drive home. (I was not present) Words were exchanged and we have had only had one minor interaction since that night. 
I explained to her I wanted her to handle the short event without my assistance so I could stay home. This is totally out of the norm for her to have to do this. I often attend family events with our two young daughters (4,2) and she is typically working or in some cases, it is her preference to not go to some of my family events. This is the first of her family events I chose to stay back from,in 13 years. I felt better knowing her brothers were going with her also, so I kept to my position of not going. 

I twice thanked her for letting me stay back, once last night and once this morning. Then a little later she expressed how she did wish I would go. I explained how I felt about the issue with her dad.
It's important to explain this get together is for him, he's been in somber mood due to a friend's death. I will not bring positive vibes to this event and don't really wish to interact with him until we resolve our conflict of judgement. I helped her with everything up until the point of them leaving. She told me we need to have a serious talk tonight about me not coming with her. I know she wants friends and family around her dad, but I do not feel comfortable going and do not feel as I will be comforting for him.

He didn’t tell me specifically because he thought when they hung out he may fall in love with her again. This went on for 3 weeks until I told him an ex reached out for closure, and I asked if it was ok with him if I went to have a talk. He used this opportunity to tell me what he was doing. It broke my heart, it felt like he was going to see her with the intention of possibly leaving me for her. I cried and cried and then we made up. To this day he hangs out with her occasionally, but I ask that he tells me first for my comfort.

Fast forward it’s been around a year and a half, he doesn’t see her often but recently his phone died and she was at the house he was at. (He didn’t know she was going to be there) He did tell me when he got home, but I will admit I got upset about it. We moved on.

He just told me she’s coming to a beach hangout that I will be at. I said it was fine and I don’t mind if she’s there. He keeps “egging me on” saying “you have nothing to worry about I love you,” “I understand if you’re uncomfy” “I think you’re uncomfy” “I understand if you don’t wanna talk to her” “I know you two have beef” even though I consistently am saying it’s ok, and I have nothing against her because she never returned his feelings.

For the first few months of our lease my roommates cut me a slight discount on the rent because I didn’t have a career job yet (I worked as a bartender), and was finishing up my degree. I thought this was a mutually beneficial relationship because they could save on rent, and I could live with friends for a discounted rate instead of commuting from home. Recently I got a job at a large financial firm that starts in August.

Since I got a new job, my roommates want me to pay more in rent. I’m fine with this, but they said that I won’t have access to the parking pad in the back of our house because we only have 5 spots, and I’m not on the lease. I understand their perspective, but what frustrates me is that they want me to pay the same amount of rent as them. I feel like this is unfair because I will have to park a couple streets away in the city, but they feel it’s justified because they could lose their security deposit (I didn’t put in for it due to my situation) if the landlord finds out about the 6th roommate. I feel as though their risk is nullified because the total amount of rent I have paid has exceeded the price of the SD.

"My gf has a best friend who she is really close with but because of life situations hasn’t been able to hang out with for some time. Her friend is also someone who’s indecisive about her plans and tend to change them last minute. 

This past week my gf had asked her friend to hang out on Saturday and as usual her friend doesn’t respond.  I start to feel bad for my gf so I offered to hang out with her instead since her friend continues to not respond as the days pass. Last night (Friday night) her friend eventually responds but is indecisive about the timing. My gf then asks if Sunday is okay  but no response was given for the rest of the night. 

I immediately begin to make plans with my gf because it seems like her friend won’t come through. There has been many instances before where her friend would simply flake on her. My gf agrees on plans with me and the night ends. Now this afternoon my gf texts me letting me know what her plan for the day is. She casually adds her date with her friend without even mentioning the plans that we had finalized. Her friend had texted her in the morning saying tonight was a good time so she reverts back to her original plan.

I told my gf how this made me feel but she believes I shouldn’t feel that way. I told her it seems like she was juggling plans between me and her friend and only wanted to have plans with me as a backup. I have zero issues with her hanging out with her friend and understand how rare it is for them to hang out, but all I wanted was an apology for how the whole situation made me feel. She responded by telling me that she meant to hang out with me if her friend doesn’t respond at all. If this was the case how come she didn’t mention that before agreeing on plans with me? I’d understand if she would tell me before that she still might hang out with her friend if her friend can make it but she didn’t say that. I don’t think this is fair and I know if roles were reversed she would feel hurt. Even if this

When I continued to ask for an apology she became irritated and aggressive. She begin to say that I’m accusing her of something she didn’t do and that I should apologize for even making a deal out of this. I asked her to stay at her house for the night to give me some space and she blew up on me. She berated me and compared me to my cheating ex when she knows how much that affects me before blocking me.

c75qq5	2019-06-29 22:49:59	weddingStock	AITA for unfollowing my friend and causing the friendship to die?	"One of my best friends growing up was a girl who lived in my neighborhood. We lived close to each other from elementary school until we graduated high school and I moved away, and from there on out we kept in touch very loosely, text messages once or twice a year.

At some point she decided she wanted to be an influencer/model on instagram. I honestly have nothing against this. Her page had a very Christian bent to it. Lots of long captions about different parables, Bible verses, devotionals, things to pray on or ways to live a Christ centered life. But her pictures were another story. They were not inherently sexual, but it was always yoga pants or cleavage or bikini shots. The kind of pictures you see on tinder but less so on instagram. The pictures were just sexual enough that it was jarring with her captions. I remember one where she was wearing just a blazer without any bottoms, sitting with her legs crossed. Porn? Obviously not. A weird choice with captions about the prodigal son? Yeah, a little.

I want to make it clear I don’t see anything wrong with her posting pictures like these. I would never shame a person for choosing to post pictures of themselves online.  But the end result of these posts is that I found them hysterical. It just felt like a screaming representation of all the self-absorbed hypocrisy that made me choose to leave the church myself. I found myself making fun of her posts in private, off of instagram. Eventually I hadn’t spoken to this girl in a few months, and her only existence in my life was as the butt of a joke. I didn’t like this, because she was still my friend even if it had been a while since we’d really caught up. So I unfollowed her.

She texted me very soon after and called me out. I was pretty taken aback and didn’t know how to respond, and she texted me again the next day and asked if she had done something wrong and if I was mad at her. I assured her that I was not mad at her, that I was simply not religious anymore and that the message didn’t resonate with me. I said that her account seemed more like a business or that of a public figure than the personal account of a friend, and that if she also had an account that was less influencer and more personal, I would love to follow that one. And I reiterated that I saw nothing wrong with how she was running her account, I just didn’t feel like I was seeing her actual life and was instead seeing a message that I didn’t care to see. I said absolutely nothing about the pictures, I framed my unfollow entirely in the context of her religious captions. I ended by saying that had I known she would get notified, I probably wouldn’t have unfollowed her, which is true. 

She never responded and we haven’t had contact since. It’s been over a year. I have no ill feelings to her but I feel like this friendship is clearly over, by her choice, and I worry that it’s because I was an ass.

c75ni2	2019-06-29 22:41:33	Throwaway6292019	AITA for being upset that my boyfriend didn't get a plus one to his best friend's wedding?	"I've been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half. We're very close. He has a best friend, K, who he went to college with and has known for about 15 years. I'm younger than my bf, and I haven't had a serious relationship before, let alone been to a friends wedding, so this is why I'm unsure if my feelings are valid or not.

K has had my boyfriend watch her kids. She sends him texts almost everyday asking for advice and has done so since I knew him. We'll be lying in bed together and his phone will go off multiple times of her spamming him with advice about her ex boyfriend. It started to bother me that K would involve my boyfriend in her drama by asking for advice and telling him what her ex is doing. I've helped watch the kids plenty of times, spent money on them for the arcade, fast food, etc.

She invited him to his wedding, her very close friend of 15 years who has stuck by her, but didn't give him a plus one, so I can't go. I have to admit that I don't have friends in my life and never get to do anything fun so I have to sit at home while he has fun at the wedding and then help him watch the kids after since she asked him when she invited him. I personally find it sort of rude that she has him watching the kids overnight on her wedding night and didn't even give him a plus one. Other people have gotten plus ones. 

Am I the asshole for being disappointed and for feeling like she's taking advantage of him (spamming his phone for advice, having him watch the kids, but won't let him bring someone else to the wedding)?

c75n4x	2019-06-29 22:40:42	jrhea2019	AITA for a comment t I made in a pregnancy chatroom?	"Scrolling through a pregnancy chat here on reddit, someone said they worked at a fast food establishment and the smells were too intense for them. I happen to be CRAVING something from that same place. I also work in a place (albeit a completely different industry) with strong smells and I put unscented vicks in my nostrils when it's getting bad and I cant smell a thing after that. SO, I said ""my advice is to bring me (food I've been craving from their place of work) and also put some vicks in your nostrils"".

I can maybe see how that's a little to-the-point, but I dont see it as being rude. But now 3 people including the person I was replying to said I was being incredibly rude and they hoped it was a bad joke. I explained that the first part clearly was a joke, but that the vicks really do help.

Then, the OP of the comment said they got fired like that was something that made my comment worse. I scowered the chat, they had not said that before my comment or anywhere else so I dont see it as effecting my comment.

I honestly just gave her an apology and left the room, because if my simple comment was that serious then there was no way I'd ever be able to really talk there freely and it wasnt worth it.

c75mt5	2019-06-29 22:39:50	throwaway-iguana	AITA for losing control of my wedding planning?	"My fiancé and I decided to get married and have a small family-only ceremony and a larger reception to include friends and family friends. 

To make sure my parents were not uncomfortable, I asked them for their permission to have the reception in my future inlaws’ backyard. It is very large, there is lots of parking, and free. My mom said (verbatim), “whatever you want for your wedding is fine with us. It’s your day and your fiancé’s too and we want you to be happy and relaxed. If FMIL and FFIL agree (which I feel sure they probably would), it would solve many issues that you have been concerned about. They can have as many people as they would like and that stress would go away for you.“

After asking their permission, we asked FMIL and FFIL if we could host the reception in their backyard. They said yes, so we found a small ceremony venue not far from their house. 

The issues began with my FMIL when she started adding a ton of people to the guest list. Fiancé and I wanted to choose our battles, so we didn’t stop her from adding people. I accept full responsibility for not saying no, as it got out of control. The final headcount is 90 guests out of 130 invited, which is more than we wanted, but is beside the point. 

We had other control issues with my FMIL, where she had ideas she wanted to do and wanted to handle a lot of the planning. More than once we had to talk her down and say no, we are doing what we want and nothing else.

While this is going on, my mom is getting upset that she isn’t included in the planning process. I didn’t intentionally exclude her, but much of the planning and logistics parts have to be discussed with FMIL/FFIL because it is at their house. She also tells me that it is hurtful because they aren’t hosting anything and she was upset her best friends weren’t going to be there to watch me get married. 

Then, my FMIL and mom talk together about the wedding and my FMIL says she is planning everything(which she’s not, I am?), that we are going to have a cake(she knew we are doing cupcakes), and several other things that were either misleading or untrue. After hearing about their conversation, it was obvious FMIL was not listening to our wishes.  

To tame the control issues and make sure everyone was on the same page, I created a to do list that included the task, the date it had to be completed by, and the owner. After that I thought all was okay. 

All this time my mom has been telling my sisters how she was upset about the wedding, that I alienated her and my dad, and how our guest list was impossible to fit in the space. 

Today, I get a text from my sister telling me what my mom had been telling her, that she was disappointed in me because I didn’t stand up to FMIL, that I let FMIL get out of control and I’m seriously hurting people in the process, that I should either uninvite people or cancel the reception, and that I’m naive for letting this happen.

A friend of ours that used to do wedding photography offered to come take the pictures for us. My parents have a really pretty backyard with a pool and lots of plants and trees, so we scheduled the shoot for there. 


When the photographer got there, we went out to the backyard to get started. Now my fiancé and I are both fairly shy people and the whole thing was awkward to begin with. My boisterous mother came outside and was trying to direct the shoot and hover over us the whole time. Now this didn’t shock me because my mom has always been the overbearing type, but it was making both my fiancé and I uncomfortable. I asked my mom to go inside because it was awkward. She refused and said I was being ridiculous. After a few more minutes, and with her griping at me to stand up straight, I finally told her she needed to go inside and had to be stern with her before she listened. 


We finished the shoot and went back inside the house. The photographer asked where my mom was and if she wanted to see the pictures before she left. I went to find her and she had locked herself in her bedroom and was refusing to come out. Our friend left and we had to pop the lock to get into her room. She was lying in bed crying because I hurt her feelings. I tried to explain that she was not respecting our feelings when I politely asked her to go inside. I apologized for hurting her feelings, but I feel like she’s acting like a child. The only reason this issue occurred is because we had the pictures at her house. If they had been literally anywhere else she wouldn’t have been invited, nor would anyone else. 


I feel like crap for making my mom cry, but it seems so ridiculous to me. That was an intimate moment and she made it weird. So am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I’m in the process of moving out, and I would post this to avoid making the same mistake at my next residence.  I moved into my current residence back in November.  There were two of us (me and Chase) moving in and one person (Jay) who already lived there.  The guy who lived there told me that there were two girls (Kat and Emma) and a guy.

One day someone came to the door and asked to speak to Jay.  I thought it was one of the neighbors but wasn’t sure and asked who she was so I could let him know who was there.  She wouldn’t give her name and just kept saying she wanted to speak to Jay.  After some back and forth I clarified that I wanted to let Jay know who was asking for him, and she told me she was the downstairs neighbor Kat.  Jay went to talk to her and later told me that she had called me a bitch.  I found out later that she had invited him and Chase to a party at their place.

Each of our apartments has a parking spot out back.  Kat was using theirs and the other spot was empty.  Street parking is more convenient when it’s available, but  I started parking back there in January because I worked til 4AM sometimes, and street parking wasn’t always available at that hour.  Shortly afterwards, Emma started parking back there 24/7.  After two nights of having to park a block away, I asked my roommate for Emma’s number so I could ask her not to park in our spot.  I asked her two times to leave the spot open after 11 PM so I could park back there but two nights in a row she was still there even though the first time she said she would move.  I finally asked her to stop parking back there period, regardless of the time and she went on about how it wasn’t actually my apartments spot and really it was the full house, and she called me a “complete bitch.”  I had to get the landlord involved and eventually I got the spot.

I was complaining to Jay about it, and he said it was kind of my fault for never introducing myself  because our first interaction was me getting onto them.  He said Emma and Kat had told him that they thought I was a rude bitch for never introducing myself.  I pointed out that Kat could have introduced herself when she came to invite Jay to their party but she didn’t.  Neither of them introduced themselves to me so I struggle to see how I’m at fault.  This came up again when Kat’s dog bit my friend as we were going to the backyard, and she said it was my fault for not having them introduce themselves to her dog because “you know she isn’t good with strangers.”

My brother crashed one of the 3 family cars right before he went back to college in January. He was at fault, the car in front of him stopped suddenly and he wasn’t paying attention. The car was totaled, we ended up donating it, and my brother ended up with a broken hand (thankfully no one else was hurt). The car he crashed belonged to my late grandparents so it had a lot of sentimental value.

Currently my brother and I are both home for the summer. Today it was brought up that my mom and I need to use the 2 remaining cars tomorrow for appointments. My brother became upset because he wanted to use one of the cars tomorrow to hang out with some friends. 

I told him that if he really wanted to hang out with friends, then he shouldn’t have crashed the car back in January. Now he’s upset and wants to leave the house; he said the incident is a  sensitive topic for him because he broke his hand. My mom is also upset and says I shouldn’t have said anything.

AITA? For one thing, my mom and I talked about each needing a car tomorrow before we even knew he wanted to use one. And it’s true that he could have used the 3rd car if he hadn’t crashed it."	Asshole	0	0

c75fc0	2019-06-29 22:20:38	Savdingo	AITA for telling My friend I wouldn't be around if he keeps talking to a girl?	"Edit: Had some helpful advice from people on what to do, even if I didn't want to hear it I've taken it into consideration and dicided to leave him to it even tho he knows where I stand, the ultimatum still stands if the situation of them getting together ever arises. Thank you for the words people. Not going to be looking into any more of these, as I feel like the opinions given were enough help. 




Last year my best friend got close with a girl, who ultimately fucked him up in multiple ways, she already had a bf but said ""I'm going to leave him when the time is right"" so she strung him on for a couple months, here's what she did. 

She painted her bf out to be a really shit person, turns out he's not that bad.

She cheated on said bf.

She constantly stirred shit within our friend group then acted all nice around them.

She hurt my gf emotionally considering they were supposed to be best friends, she constantly threw her under the bus.

After leading my friend on the whole time she dropped him the second her bf threatened to leave and that made my friend feel worthless. I helped him emotionally as best as I could for the months after since she really messed his head up.

Well recently she added him back and he's been talking to her (as friends) but it feels like a slap in the face. He told me how much she hurt him, so why even bother talking to her again. It's as easy as block.

Hes told me if she pisses him off he'll block her but I don't trust that he will, And I've told him that I'm not going to be around if he puts himself through it again. It honestly feels like a big slap in the face. I'm not saying he owes me anything because I helped him through it but I'm not putting myself through helping him again if I've constantly warned him it's going to happen.

I had done over 70 chin-ups in increments of four or five. With each set being answer by 12 to 16 press-ups.

I usually time a minute between sets.

I'm exhausted. I'm leaning against this bicep curl machine, daydreaming, away with my thoughts. For anywhere between 2 and half minutes to 5 minutes. I'm having a kind of a blood sugar crash.

Next thing this guy comes up on my left and says ""Are you just gonna stand there looking at people!?!"".

I answered friendly ""I know man, I'm wrecked all ready"".

He shook is head and went off. Like I had done the worst thing in the world.

I got caught up about this.

What's your view? Was he in the right or in the wrong to say it? Was I in the right or the wrong to stand their looking out at everyone, away with my own thoughts?

After he said it, he goes off to verbally pat butts, with some big dude.

c75d98	2019-06-29 22:15:12	GrouchyWear	AITA for not wanting to care for my autistic brother?	"My older brother is on the autism spectrum. He’s functioning to where he can have a job (janitor), hang out with friends, etc. but he cannot live alone for several reasons. Growing up, my parents always told me that I would be the one to take care of him when the time came and that he would have to live with me. I was never expected to help much when we were kids when it came to the disorder, but it was just what they wanted me to do when both of them passed on. My mom has never wanted him living in a “home”.

As I got older, I started bringing up the idea of assisted living to her and she got upset. She says no one will take care of him in the same way she does. I sort of just let it go, because I know it’s a sensitive issue. My dad, I know, was either way about it but tended to side with my mom and say that “family takes care of family”.

My father passed away a few years back, not long after I married my wife. My mother isn’t sick at the moment, but the time will come at some point where I will be responsible (and it’s in the will that when she dies, I am the person responsible for my brother since he cannot make choices for himself).

I admitted to my wife that I don’t want my brother living with us. I love my brother, don’t get me wrong. I just do not want to be responsible for him and I think he will thrive living in an assisted living facility. He already attends activities at one and he loves it. My wife has basically said, it’s up to me because he’s my brother. I’ve spoken to him about it and he says that he doesn’t care where he lives, so long as he can keep his routine. I promised him that we’d (my wife, the kids and myself) visit him and he could come to us, he could still keep his job (which is the most important thing to him), he could do even more activities there, etc.

My mom is upset with me that this is what I want to do. I told her that ultimately, it will be my choice as his guardian, unless she wanted to change that. We have other family, but no one else that would take him on full time. She said that this was the last thing she ever wanted, but I pointed out that she never asked me what I did either.

Since they RSVP'd, they have been on track to divorcing and they no longer live together or see each other often. We started dating a few months ago. She is nervous that if she does not invite him to the wedding her family and friends will start asking questions and she wants to tell people at her pace and not inform everybody at once.

I am not liking how they will be staying in the same hotel room, nor spending a whole weekend together, or attending a romantic event together. I get going through a divorce is hard, and it needs to be done at their own pace but I feel she shouldn't let him go despite potential questions she may get, or at the very least have them stay at different hotels. The wedding is in a small town where people will notice they are at different hotels.

So I go into the exam room and the doctor calmly explains the procedure and said it would take about 3-5 seconds. I replied ""Hah, take your time, doc! I'm looking forward to it"" 

He just stared for a few seconds and said ""Uh huuh....."" with a puzzled look. It hit me that I probably came off as a sexual harasser and felt SO guilty. I wanted to explain I was just excited to have this problem fixed but the mood was so awkward I just kept me mouth shut.

Suffice to say my aunt and mother are very close, aunt went to the hospital and hasn't been doing great. Aunt has had problems with her ex-husband (non-abusive) in the past and came to live with us. Now that Aunt is in the hospital, she's been friendlier with her ex husband and has been trying to get her stuff out for unknown reasons relating to her being friendly with her ex-husband. My mother doesn't like said ex-husband for reasons that she hasn't given me and texted me saying not to answer the door, or let him anywhere on the property except the driveway. I have never had a bad experience with said ex-husband but I know hes done some not cool, generally dickish things that shall remain unstated. Definitely not cool things, but nothing horrible. 

Anyway, today Ex-husband shows up on doorstep, mother is at work. They had been coming to grab one of my aunt's two cars. One vehicle is in our driveway, the other in the backyard. I texted my mother letting her know what was going on, but she was in a meeting and replied only with a recap of ""only let him in the driveway"". Except he was here for the car in the yard. I texted my mother saying why he was here, she responded with a message she had sent to my aunt stating that we would be unable to help remove the car from the yard because it had to be pushed and we had nobody to help. Except the husband brought a battery. I tried to text my parent asking what she wanted me to do   but all she said was that she was in a meeting and didn't have time to deal with this.

I then made an executive decision and said ""fuck it"". It sounded to me like they were going to get the car anyway and I figured if I dealt with it she didn't have to and we could avoid conflict between anyone. So I let him in the backyard, the only thing I allowed him to do/place to go was to get the vehicle. 

Few hours later, my mother returns and is quite upset that I took this executive action and led to her screaming about how I didn't have the right to make that decision as she pays the mortgage.

c75ab0	2019-06-29 22:07:38	anetanetanet	AITA for expecting my boyfriend to come over as well instead of just me going to his house all the time?	"In short, we both still live at home (him 27, me 25) but planning to move out soon as we both finally got jobs that pay enough for that to be possible. We mostly are together from Friday night to Monday morning. 

Now, for the situation. We've been together 2 - something years. We have very different houses, as his parents are well off and have a big house with a yard and we have his room, another room, and a bathroom just to ourselves - BUT he lives far away, so I always have to take a taxi to his place as otherwise it takes an hour to get there (very shitty public transport). Also on Mondays to get to work on time - because of traffic - I have to leave at least an hour in advance which sucks major ass.

My house, on the other hand, is just an apartment, my parents are always around and there's no way to get away from them but to sit in my room with the door closed. My dad is always making a scene and the TV is always turned up so loud you can't hear your thoughts. So it's not... The best. 

We've always had arguments about this because it's tiring and annoying to always have to come over with my bag packed, to either have go home Sunday evening or wake up super early Monday. He says that he's just not comfortable at my place for various reasons (like my bed being too short for him so he doesn't sleep well), but the gist of it being he only feels really comfortable at home.

I definitely agree that his place has more positive points than mine, but I think expecting him to maybe just come over on Sunday every other week (his work is very close to my house) isn't that bad.... I've been kind of pestering him for always making excuses to not come to my house, cause it honestly pisses me off. He treats it like no one is *making* me come over if I don't want to, but like..... That's the only time in the week we actually get to hang out or sleep together. Of course I want to come.

I'm asking this here finally because he came over on Thursday after we went on a walk and when we got home, surprise surprise, no hot water (some city plumbing issue, which honestly happens way too often). He got super pissed that it's so shitty, that if he just went home this wouldn't have been a problem and it all made me feel really crappy, like he was indirectly blaming me for this problem cause I asked him to come over in the first place. He did say later that he was just angry cause there's just so much random shit like this that happens at my house and it wasn't directed at me but it just felt crappy. I told him today that I'm just never going to invite him to my house again because I'm tired of hearing how much he doesn't like being there. It makes me sad that he didn't object.

Soooo - AITA here at all? I'm not exactly super excited and comfortable at his house either, i have my own reasons as well, but I just got used to it and take it as it is. Should I just drop the issue? Any other advice in how to navigate this situation?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c759hn	2019-06-29 22:05:27	linoyw	AITA for trying to defend a mobile home park online	" this happened on nextdoor. my town is very techy and quite wealthy.

i saw a post about a murder that happened at a mobile home park in town. the first comment on the post was ""How many calls are taken at this location on a weekly basis?"" another person, jane, responded to this comment, telling them off for their rude response on a post about a murder. a man, john, replied to jane saying that the first comment was completely valid and that ""There are no biased assumptions when you are dealing with facts."" TLDR: Jane tells off John for trying to defend the first comment. John says Jane is rude and says he would like the mobile home park to be torn down as it is a ""cesspool and a center for criminal activity."" Jane tells him off again for his remark about the mobile home park.

so this is where i come in. i was very upset by what john was saying. i was just so pissed off by what he was saying, as i come from a working class background and have friends living in said mobile home park, that i responded.

Me: Dearest John: I believe it is in everyones best interest if you would, put into appropriate terms, be quiet. Youve come onto this post about a murder of someone who lives in the same city as you, where you should be showing compassion, only to write rude comments about an already targeted group of people. Newsflash: not everyone is blessed to live in a place like \[his neighborhood\]. No one in the mobile home park is living there because they want to; they are living there because they have to. You remind me of a certain person who preaches that ""facts dont care about your feelings"" and use that sort of term to try and invalidate other people. I hope that maybe you could learn that maybe it isnt appropriate to spew hate about people of a lower social class than you, but youre most likely going to label me as being a liberal teenager whining about things not being PC and ignore what I have to say like you did with Jane.

i tried to be sarcastic, but maybe it wasnt the best idea to be sarcastic on a serious topic. i get a reply from another guy, todd, who said that i was showing upper-middle class arrogance and that if i was a hater of the lower social class.

i wrote a reply, trying to defend myself, but i deleted it after maybe three minutes because i didnt think it was relevant. apparently it wasnt fast enough because i get a pm from todd. he basically said that because i live in our town, i must be in the top 10% of income and my attitude was condescending. he posted on the original post again, basically saying that yes, “poor” people commit more crimes than “wealthy” people, following it with “I put poor and wealth in quotes because there is no one in the U.S. who is poor by world standards of poverty.”

i dont understand what problem this guy has with me, as i wasnt trying to be rude towards the mobile home park. i was trying to be more sarcastic towards john, but i can understand if it made me seem condescending. was i the asshole of the situation?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c758e7	2019-06-29 22:02:58		AITA for making my mom cry by telling her that someone she doesn’t like got a higher grade than I did?	"  I know it sounds weird and I don’t think I was the asshole, but my father thought I was TA big time. So here it is.

A bit of context. My mother was and still is pretty strict with school and things in general. 

She also developed a strong dislike towards one of my classmates (we’ll call her A), because I once got something like a 7/10 in a literature oral quiz/test and this friend of mine got a higher grade than me. Which isn’t something that inconceivable in my mother’s mind, but in our shared ride home with my mum, she dared to give me advice on how I could improve. From that moment on, my mom started disliking her because she thought she was pretentious and a fake intellectual of some sort. Which is ridiculous, but there wasn’t much I could say to change her mind. I didn’t even try because besides some comment here and there, she rarely brought it up. 

One thing she would do though was asking what my other classmates got on tests and she showed an interest in this girl’s accomplishments. 

So fast forward a few months.  

English class comes and I get picked along with a couple of other classmates for a random speaking test. It goes really well and I get a 9/10. Which is absolutely fantastic, I was really happy with myself. I always had good grades in English so I really wasn’t expecting any sort of reaction from my parents other than a “Good” or “Well done”. 

Well, I was wrong. She asked me what A got. And you know, sometimes I would downplay other people’s grades to make myself look better, but this time I was just fed up. I didn’t like the tone in her voice. A had not even been picked for the speaking test that day, but I told my mother that she was picked and that she got a 10/10. A never got better grades than me in English, so I knew/was hoping it would spark a reaction in her. It did. She was furious. She screamed at me and told me that it was unacceptable and that she wouldn’t pay for me to go on my scheduled summer trip to London in order to study English because I didn’t deserve it since I clearly wasn’t putting in enough effort in my English studies. She started crying and screaming that she wouldn’t let me go so I locked myself in my room, she came at my door, scratching it in utter desperation asking me to get out and yelling at me. 

Eventually, I told her that I made it all up to which she went to her room and cried even more, while my father reprimanded me and my brother kinda wondered why would I even do something like that in the first place. 

So, reddit, am I the asshole here? Should I just have said the she wasn’t picked and called it a day?

TL;DR Knowing it could hurt her, I made my mother believe that a friend of mine whom she doesn’t like got a higher grade  (10 out of 10) than me (9 out of 10), and she cried and yelled."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Now N and I met in 6th grade during drama, and she was kind of annoying at first but I mean I didn’t mind as much at first. she began to get more clingy and annoying about many things. She would randomly meow during classes and also follow me around at times. It was weird. My mom forced me to invite her to our lake house one weekend and her family came too. Her parents are wonderful people but N and her brother are just... I don’t know. But anyways, last year she came into connections (like a homeroom type class) crying many times and it was always me who had to comfort her. It was always over little things that had no effect on anything but this last time, she told me she made somebody cut themselves. I was shocked and just told her to go to the school counselor because there was no way I was going to handle that. It turns out that she was already reported for drawing a picture of two friends of mine KISSING. I was disgusted and shocked. N was always off in a way I couldn’t put my finger on but this was creepy as HELL. 
Another thing to add; my mom also told her mom about a summer camp I attend and now she is attending with me. She always requests to be in my cabin and does all the same activities as me. I feel trapped in this friendship.

TL: DR at the end.

&#x200B;

I (25F) work in a very small office with 3 other people, one of them being my coworker Gary.

&#x200B;

Gary is a parent in his late 30's, married, with two kids.

&#x200B;

I'm newer to the step-mom scene. In fact, legally I'm not a step-mom. I'm engaged to my wonderful fiancé, Jared(30M). Jared has two daughters that are 6 and 11. We own a home together, the girls have their own space, and we have custody of the youngest 60% of the time. Both the girls mothers wished me a Happy Mothers Day and I did the same for them.

&#x200B;

Now, that being said when we have discussions about children Gary likes to try and ""reassure me"" that I will ""understand when I have my own kids"". Just recently he was asking if we were bringing the girls to a day camp next month. He makes sure to always include my fiancé Jared's name in the conversation as if I could not do anything with them myself.

&#x200B;

I let him know that we work and that we don't usually have the girls during most of that time per our custody arrangement but that my mom could bring them the last day. (We have our 6-year-old Friday-Tuesday and the 11-year old is here for the summer but goes back to spend the week before and that specific week with her mom, they BOTH will be back the last day of this event). He got flustered and told me that our custody arrangement was confusing and I will really love having ""my own child"" because I won't have to deal with that nonsense. I did combat this and said if we planned ahead we could have worked this out as we change schedules easily but this thing was not one we wanted to prioritize. This apparently frustrated him even more. He let me know it was ""different"" when you have your own kids as you can do what you want with them. He followed it up with letting me know that things will change after we have a child of our own because we won't get a break from them like we do right now.

&#x200B;

This really rubbed me the wrong way as I think of the children as my own and I'm really sick of him telling me that I don't understand things because they are not mine. I do not know what in his mind disqualifies me as a parent when the children and their moms think of me as their step-mom. In my culture we do not say things like step/half/adopted, family is just family. My fiancé is from the same culture as well so its really lovely to not have to explain this. I feel blessed that his family, the girls, and their mothers love me and accept me as a step-mom. I don't know what to do honestly because it's not like he is going to stop being my coworker anytime soon.

TL:DR: My co-worker does not think I'm a real parent because I'm a step-parent and we do not have 100% custody of the children and he likes to tell me whenever an event comes up where we do not have the kids.

"So, recently a very lovely co-worker of mine (I'll call her Bridget for this story) out of the blue asked me if I knew someone called Karen. I did and upon asking her why she asked, she told me that:

""Oh, my family just moved house and our neighbour saw my uniform and asked if I knew a guy called Rowan. I said yes and she said you went to uni together.""

She gushes about how nice she's been (she welcomed them to the neighbourhood with a cake and introduced them to her kids). Then, as we were working, she curiously asks me a bit about her and what she's like.

So I told her the truth. We don't really get along but she's nice enough, though she is a bit of a Karen™. We both laugh about how Bridget was unsurprised and kind of got that vibe regardless.

Then I was struck to the core by an insatiable urge to gossip.
I've only really told, prior to this, my best friend the story because I was utterly floored by it and needed someone to just be outraged with me (and we're just open about everything like that).
But, as she was:

1. Karen's neighbour.
2. I don't like Karen (we'd had a major falling out MONTHS ago and were not on speaking terms).
And,
3. The bitch was asking about me.

So, I felt that Bridget had earned all the juicy details of the 8 year long affair Karen was currently engaged in with a mutual friend of her and her husband. Leaving Bridget absolutely speechless that this kindly, though stereotypically Karen-y, lady was this awful.

Fast forward to a few weeks later and I'm on shift with Bridget again and am curious to see how Karen is doing, so ask.
Bridget claims that Karen seems VERY wary of her and avoids eye contact and doesn't talk to Bridget or her family. Despite being so friendly before.
Bridget swears she hasn't done or said anything, though I don't know if I believe her. She can be a bit snarky and passive aggressive, so I feel she may have done so and tipped Karen off.

Which seems to be likely as I received a phone call Last week from none other than Karen herself, correctly accusing me of telling Bridget:

""I KNOW you told that girl Rowan! How dare you! It's none of your business so how dare you spread that around."" hurling vitriol at me for a few minutes and very upset that it could effect her marriage before I hung up.

So, am I the asshole? Karen and few of our uni friends are calling me a prick (the nicer names I've been called) for ""telling people"" and not minding my own business. And in theory, Karen's husband could find out and it would destroy their marriage. Am I the asshole here, should I not tell anyone?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c7540s	2019-06-29 21:51:53		AITA for not feeling as close to my mother after accidentally frightening her?	"A couple of years ago my mom, my grandmother, and myself \[17m at the time\] were riding a bus. My mother and grandmother sat together while I sat somewhere else. I saw that some girls needed a seat and offered mine if one of them wanted, but they declined. I asked if they were sure and they insisted. As I was going to sit down my mother yelled from her seat ""that's not how it works!"" condescendingly, then with her index finer motioned me to stand in the back. Even the girls seemed very uncomfortable with the situation. I felt lectured and embarrassed, and immaturely tried to return the favor. I stood next to my mom and leaned down (to whisper and not make a scene) and started telling her angrily that she embarrassed me and that she was being a bitch. After ranting for a bit I calmed down, leaned back up, and just stood there kinda upset the rest of the ride.

Everything seemed fine for several days. I was visiting my dad when my sister calls me and starts yelling that I'm a piece of shit, I make people feel unsafe and so on. I had no idea what she was talking about and hung up and started freaking out with self-doubt. My dad was there and told me to call her back later when she was calmed down. I called her back and she told me that my mom and grandmother felt cornered and physically endangered by me; this was a complete surprise for me. I gave my sister my side of the story, she apologized for jumping to conclusions, and we talked about it.

My dad had gotten a call from my mom telling him her side of the story while I was talking to my sister. When my dad asked about it I broke down and started crying. I mean, *my own mother thinks I'm a woman beater*... *my own mother thinks that I would actually hurt her*. I felt like a disgusting monster that should just leave everyone else be. After comforting me he said I needed to talk to my mother about it, so I did.

I listened to my mom and she was right to point out that I wasn't self-aware about my size (skinny but 6'4"") and how it might frighten someone. I apologized for coming off as threatening, but said that it hurt when my sister called making all those accusations out of nowhere. She apologized for being condescending on the bus and for telling my sister a biased story instead of talking with me about it. But I feel like shit because my mom thinks I'm violent, not because my sister knows that's how she feels. My mom didn't seem to understand my sadness, treating it like it was illegitimate.

Ever since, I've felt like an ape trying not to accidentally hurt anyone. I've always been terrible with girls (still no kiss) but now the anxiety and guilt I get from the thought of them feeling I might hurt them just makes me not want to approach anyone.

I haven't felt as close to my mother since before the incident, and I feel like I don't even have the right to feel that way because she can't control her feelings. But it still doesn't make me feel any less hurt. AITA?"		1	0

Last week my mother and her partner got married after a year of being together. Her new husband also happens to be the father of a horrible classmate who used to bully me everyday in high school. 

The worst part is, one time at school I tried to stand up for myself by punching the son hard in the face when he was calling me names, and his father, the man whom my mom would eventually marry years later, got me expelled because he was a prominent figure in town.

I talked about it with my mom when I first found out they were dating. But she dismissed it as just kids being kids and he (her husband) was only protecting his son. 
The father had tried to apologize to me many times when he found out that he was dating the mother of a boy whom he had had expelled for standing up to his bully of a son. But I refused to accept his apology. 

What his son had done to me had affected my confidence in a way that I grew up being a recluse thinking I was not good enough because the son always called me a communist bastard, which may or may not have been true considering my grandfather had run away to another country to escape prison before I was born. My parents separated when I was only a toddler. 

My mother thinks I should let go of past hurts. I wish it was that easy. I'm still struggling with self-worth until now. I told her she can marry him if she loves him, but I won't be there for the wedding and won't associate myself with him and his son. It still hurts me a lot seeing them now.

"I moved around a little bit too much as a kid and as a result I kinda don't like to stay in the same place for too long. Every 3-4 years I end up pulling a sort of Irish Goodbye on a lot of my friends who think they are closer to me than they are. I have done this like 8 times now. I have mentioned that I do this to a few people and usually they give me the same response ""You better not do that to me"" or ""that's an asshole move"" but  I'm not so sure it's an asshole move. Plenty of people have to go their separate ways throughout life that's just how it is.

I haven't had a problem when people have done it to me.

Is that an asshole move? I don't mean anything bad by it truly....I just feel like my time with those people has run its course, goodbyes suck, and Im ready for the next stage of life.

Edit: I accept that rn I am the asshole.

Edit: I also want to emphasize that I don't just drop off the earth one day. My point was that I don't like awkward goodbyes and I don't like to linger and be stagnant. It's more of a I stop checking in with them and usually I end up leaving without any formal goodbyes.

c750hl	2019-06-29 21:43:09		AITA for bringing up my sisters shyness during dinner	"Hello,

Recently my mom and sister, who is 17, met some of my friends and their families, and I noticed how extreme my sisters shyness is. She never engages in conversation, and when she is asked questions, she only answers with a ""uuum"" followed by a ""yes"", ""no"", or ""I don't know"". Often when she is asked a question she smiles and just looks at mom immediately, as kind of a non-verbal call for help, and then my mom proceeds to carry on the conversation. At one point, my friend, who she had just met about an hour earlier, answered a question regarding where she goes to school for her. 

&#x200B;

I was a little taken aback, and during dinner I decided to bring it up. I only want the best for her, and thought that maybe if I push her a little and encourage her to step out of her comfort zone she can see that small talk isn't going to kill her. I said that its not really normal for my friends, who she had just met, to answer questions directed at her. She started breaking down and crying. I hate seeing my sister like that, but I decided to double down when my mom told her that its fine. She wouldn't stop crying so we decided just to drop it, and we haven't talked about it since.

So my sister had surgery on her foot on May 31st to remove some bone because it wasn't healing properly. At least that was the story I was told, my folks don't usually tell me shit unless they need something. She says she needs to borrow the $600 she has to pay for the surgery before they will do it. She originally said she only needed to borrow the money for 1 day as she would get paid on June 1st and could pay me back then. The next day she texts me asking if she could pay me out instead of paying me all at once and I said that's fine, thinking oh she would pay me a little every time she got paid which is what I usually did when I had to borrow money from ppl. Since then she hasn't paid me anything or even talked to me about it. She is still recovering and can't put  weight on her foot, can't drive etc. She just got cleared to start work again within the past week (I think). I know she is bad with managing money so I dont want it to go too long before she ""forgets"" that she hasn't paid me. I'm a college student so I'm not exactly sitting on a gold mine, but I can cover my bills for right now.

I was doing a really simple job where I just had to put some posters up around the workplace with this other girl when these two old women came up to me.

One started telling me I was gonna get in trouble for doing that and I was confused so I just told her,

“Doing what?”

She then started saying stuff like she was gonna report me, tell my manager yadayada, then when I started walking away she asked me directions since the place I work at is confusing to walk around if you don’t know where you’re going, and when I tried telling her she kept cutting me off going on again about getting me in trouble. 

She and the other lady then grabbed not just my shoulder but the shoulder of the girl who I was working with, for me the grab was not too hard but it was firm enough for me to tell she was putting some force into it. I wouldn’t care if it was just me, but the other girl was not only just a high school sophmore but new at the job so I got a little mad and grabbed the ladies arm off of me and sternly told them.

“Get your damn hand off of us.” As angrily as I could. 

The people who had been watching this whole time then started to intervene and afterwards I was just told by my boss next time try not to escalate a situation if something like that happens again.

I got some concerning looks from other people, some of them even asked the old lady if she was ok which made me think, am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

After the gym my girlfriend (20f) usually wants to spend time together which I love, but some days I just want to stay in my apartment alone and play video games.

These specific nights, instead of being honest, I've been hiding the fact that I'm playing video games when she asks what I'm up to by saying I still need to cook dinner, go to the gym etc.. 

We've been together for just under a year and the reason I've been hiding this fact is because she used to complain about her ex playing too many video games. Shes never been a gamer herself and grew up in a setting that emasculates gamers.

c74wgn	2019-06-29 21:33:06	Assholebrotherignore	AITA for being uninterested in my older brother's attempt to build a sibling relationship with me?	"So I have an older brother who's a couple years older than me. We're both guys in our 20s. As a kid, we weren't distant, but he didnt really bother interacting with me, as he was always just indoors playing games and surfing the web. He never bothered to really care about my life. As a result, I never gained any feeling of closeness or respect for him. I never saw him as a big brother. I have some older friends who I see more as a mentor/""older brother"".
 
When he got into college, he moved to the west coast, and I barely heard from for like 8 years. In this time, I graduated from highschool and college and started my career. Recently, my brother has tried to reconnect (remotely cause he permanently moved to another country), and he's trying to act like an older sibling. He tries to ask how my life is, and give unsolicited advice. I respect his attempt, but at this point, he's pretty much a stranger to me. We share no interests (he still only plays games, nothing else). He's terrible to talk to, because he hasnt had much social interaction. 

I also don't like that he's trying to pigeonhole me into a ""younger sibling"" role, when I've independently matured over the last 8 years with 0 influence from him. In fact I have experienced far more in terms of romantic relationships, gaining skills, and reaching career milestones. It's super obvious that he feels inadequate about how much my life has progressed past his, so he's trying to cement his position as ""the older brother"".

 I feel like there's nothing I gain from this relationship, and no matter how hard I try, I cant summon the desire to interact with him. I feel no connection to him. I have closer, older mentors who would do anything for me, and vice versa. He also wouldn't help me take care of our parents (he has no desire to return to USA, and he cant afford it). People grow apart for all sorts of reasons, and I don't think I should put more effort into my brother just cause we share some DNA. I think it would be good for both of us if I let him know that he's pretty much a stranger to me, and that we should remain courteous, but not try to build a sibling relationshop at this point. I can focus on connections that mean more to me, and he can find someone who he can better relate to. We'd save each other time. AITA?

Edit: my main gripe is that my brother is trying to put me into the ""little brother"" role. This is a big deal in my culture, because I have to respect and look up to him. Ive basically outgrown him in the 8 years he spent only playing games, making me a bit peeved about him trying to do this. If anything, he could really use me as a mentor, but he's too proud for that.


Edit2: If he was an acquaintance or a classmate, I wouldnt bother putting in effort to have a relationship, because we dont click at all. I dont know why I have to entertain him just because we share some dna."	No A-holes here	0	0

I have been friends with this person for 2 years. We’ll call her Anna. Anna suffers from depressions and anxiety which I help her through because I’ve been there myself, I know how it feels and I always try to be there for her. 

Cut to two weeks ago she makes a post about how she is taking a break from social media. I text her and say, 
“Hey, I saw your post on social media and I hope you are okay. I love you so much and let me know if you need me for anything. Get some sleep, drink some water, and take care of yourself.”

She doesn’t reply for about 3 days, which worries me because she ALWAYS replies back. I texted her bf who said that he had just talked to her an hour ago and I said, “okay good, just making sure she’s okay.”

She finally gets back to me after a week and says, “Hey I’m ok, thanks.” And I reply back and say, “No problem, if you wanna talk about it let me know.”

She hasn’t replied back to me in a week. It only bothers me because she’s been posting on social media and talking to other people in our friend group, but not me. I’m not jealous or angry at her, I’m just confused because she’s not answering me. I haven’t confronted her about it because 1.) I don’t want to sound like a jealous friend. 2.) I don’t want to make her even more depressed. It’s just getting ridiculous because we are best friends. I haven’t done anything besides try to reach out to her which idk if maybe that made her mad??? But I’ve texted her everyday and I know she’s read it but she’s ignoring them. Is it even worth confronting her? WIBTA for just stopping communication?

We all work for in the same place, but for different companies- mine just so happens to be a company where people get in early, so I do too. This means I have to get up early (around 5-ish). In order to minimise disruption, I set my alarm to vibrate. I should also mention that I don't sleep a lot, and usually can't get to sleep when he does.

Anyway, he gets to bed at 10, and the walls are paper-thin. So much so that I hear him snore at around 10:30/11, but lately, he's been complaining to other tenants that I wake him up really early. Thing is, the alarm is set to vibrate, and every now and then I might take a few minutes to wake up, and thus I'll hit snooze about 3/4 times max.

My band director told me to email him my speech while I was away and he told me he would read it for me during the speeches in my place.

c74ojj	2019-06-29 21:13:04	issitohbi	AITA for what I said to/about my stepbrother?	"Hopefully I can articulate this within 3000 characters. A few months back my brother (Matt) asked me to help him file an annulment. This wasn't the first issue - he has a Secret Snapchat that multiple people contacted her through Instagram about. (Important later.) I got her (Lily) side, I got his, & they both had valid complaints. One of his being that she doesn't support his passions (read: car), even though he often invites her along. I recommended couple's counseling. We're Native American, so the tribal court denied his annulment because they only handle divorces. He didn't have me draw up divorce papers or file the annulment with the state court.

After saying he wanted to wreck his car and going MIA, he texted me a photo of Lily to say they were getting back together. All was well for a week or two before he was back to posting on his SS about wrecking the car, being done with it all, wanting it to be over, etc. I get texts here and there from Lily when she feels down because of him & needs to talk.

Last weekend Lily texted me because Matt had a car thing he was doing, she asked to go, & he pouted around the house saying he no longer wanted to go. He ended up going, leaving her there. At about 10pm she texted me screenshots of asking if he was going to be home soon, to which he replied ""idk :(""

Eventually it's 2am & he's still not home despite texting her an hour previously that he was on his way. I was asleep so I woke up to her text.Meanwhile on his SS: ""Just ready for this shit to be over with."" I never say anything, but this time I couldn't help it.

""Ur being kinda a dick tho. She asked to go w/ u & you just left her alone all day, then were gone til 2am like ur single n shit. She was so upset she contacted me asking if she could talk about it & what I thought. You told me that u invite her to car things & she says no, so what's the deal? \[...\] It's not rocket science. Your wife shouldn't be at home crying for 12 hours because she's so sad.""

He blocked me and told Lily that he was mad at her for talking to me because it's ""nobody else's business."" He also said that he doesn't talk to anyone else about their problems, which is false because he talks to me, our mom, our cousins, & who knows who else. Maybe it wasn't the smartest for me to say anything in response to his post, but if we stand by & watch bad behavior, it will only continue. Apparently that's what I'm supposed to do though.

A few days later I told my stepmom about the SS blocking & made a joke that if a divorce *is* filed, that I hope she beats him to it & requests alimony because then he'll be single but can't go out like a bachelor. Apparently she told Matt that I'm trying to convince Lily to file, which is *completely* false. I've been actively telling Matt to get couples counseling. But he's mad anyways. Yeah, it was a shitty (dark) joke, but it was *clearly* a joke. So, am I the asshole?

Well I have a niece and nephew. Niece is like 8 and we've known her since she was 3 and she ADORES my ex, nephew was born last summer. I told my ex I wouldn't tell people to pick sides or anything, family or friends and I haven't, even after she admitted to lying constantly through our relationship. Now she's pissed at me because I won't argue on her behalf to have a relationship with my sister or her kids. I promised not to tell them to abandon her, not that I would fix her relationship with my family. 

She wants to watch them grow up, yet only sees them when they would come over despite only being 20 min away. Never texted my sister or anything to have a relationship outside of family events.

If I still had a marriage that would be one thing, but you're not my family anymore. Your relationships are your problem, and you're the one that caused this rift to begin with.

My sister Serenity was dating this guy Jalen for the last 5 months. They only broke up a few weeks ago because our parents forced them to after they found out about the relationship. They're not against her dating (I had a girlfriend when I was 16), but he was absolutely NOT good news. The dude was a 20 year old college dropout with a criminal record. I've talked to her about finding someone more age appropriate that's better for her and she seemed to understand.

On an unrelated note, I gave Serenity the key to my apartment a couple years ago in case she ever wants to chill. Our parents can be pretty overbearing sometimes, so I gave it to her in case she ever wanted to get away.

Well anyways, I came home today and opened my door to see her and her (supposed to be ex) boyfriend having sex on my sofa. I screamed which caused her to scream (I didn't expect anyone to be in my house) and then asked her what the hell did she think she was doing. She apologized and she tried covering herself and said I thought she'd be at work (I took a new job last weekend and I work 100% remotely; I was coming home from my boyfriend's place). I told them to get out and left my apartment.

I then phoned my mom (I didn't really care about the sex; mostly about the whom) and she went to pick her up. Her ride here was Jalen, and I was not going to let him take her home. My mom was furious because she was supposedly ""at the mall with friends"".

I feel kinda bad, because knowing my parents, she's likely going to be punished pretty badly. But this dude was not good news, and I felt like they should be aware that they're still seeing each other. Was I in the wrong?

But I was 17 at the time, and the Dollar Store sells smokes. So I had to wait to get the job. The store is only a short walk from my mom's house. We knew everyone there, and it was almost a gerentee I would get a job there.
 Well, my mom has been unemployed for a while now and she also applied there. She got the job, and I thought we could work different shifts. The manager later told me that we can't work at the same store. The only other stores are a longer distance, and not a gerentee, and the job market in this town is god awful. So I possibly lost my best shot at a job. I haven't said anything to my mom, but I am angry at her. I haven't ever had a job, and this was the best chance for me. Plus, it's an easy walk from the school I go to, an online type school where I do most work at home but have to do the tests at school. And neither of us have cars, so we both have to use the bus or walk. So feel like I was fucked over, am I the asshole for feeling this way? Also sorry for any mistakes, I'm on mobile


Edit. There was one thing I left out. She may be getting a different job soon through my grandma (you don't get a job in this town unless you know someone or have a degree, that's one reason why Im so angry about this)

c74k45	2019-06-29 21:02:18	Santa1936	AITA for not wanting my sister to have a guy she just met come stay with us?	"So I have a very fortunate living situation. My grandparents provided me and my siblings a house to stay in rent free during college, and for a year after college. My parents act as landlords for the house. I graduated in May, my older sister graduated over a year ago, but is still living there. 

  The problem is that she traveled to a country in Europe and met a guy who now wants to come stay with her for at least a couple weeks in August. He'd be staying in her room, but he'd still be in the same house as me, and I just don't think I'd be comfortable with someone who she hasn't even known for a week coming and staying in our house for an extended period of time. She can't even give me a set length of time that he'd be staying. Ultimately it's up to my parents, but I want to know if I'd be an asshole for telling her I'm uncomfortable with it and petitioning my parents to dissallow this.

  There are two things that have been brought up that could complicate the situation. First is a situation where I was definitely the asshole. I'll readily admit that. Last summer my friend needed a place to stay, so I asked my parents without asking my sister, and they allowed it. (We have a guest bedroom he stayed in.) As far as I'm concerned the two aren't equivalent, as I had been friends with the guy for seven years, whereas this would be inviting a complete stranger into our home. However I understand that I was the asshole there, I just don't know if that warrants risking someone stealing my stuff.

  The second is that we've both had bf's/gf's stay the night before. So the precendent has been established that that's acceptable. However it seems to me that there's a huge difference between someone who I've been dating, who has an apartment 15 minutes away staying the night, than someone who she just met flying halfway across the world to use our house as a hotel. If shit goes wrong it's a lot harder to kick that person out.

"Yesterday my boyfriend (20M) and I (19F) were making out and I broke away to tell him that I don't always like kissing with tongue, because, to be honest, I don't. I didn't mean for it to be hurtful in any way, I just wasn't feeling all mushy gushy. 

Well, apparently this really upsets him, which was *not my intention at all!* I try to talk him about it, and tell him that I love him and the way he kisses, but just like ice cream flavors, I'm not always in the mood for the same thing. He gets upset, which makes me even more upset. He has to leave to go to work before we can resolve the issue. 

I feel like I've been a shitty girlfriend at this point so I confide in my roommate and ask her if I have been an ass? She tells me I haven't been, and preference is just preference. 

My boyfriend comes back after work and we just sleep. But he hasn't really kissed or touched me since I made the comment, so I just felt like I had to say something this morning. We kinda get into a heated fit. He says he doesn't know how to kiss me anymore. I tell him he's being stubborn, and shouldn't take my comment directly to heart. I tell him I talked with my roommate and what she said. This really really upsets him. He says I apparently promised yesterday that I wouldn't tell my roommate about this. I'm going crazy because I cannot remember even talking to him about my roommate?

I beg him to stay so we can talk it out but he refuses. I feel really upset now. Have I been a total shit? Any advice for repairing this?

c74iho	2019-06-29 20:58:24		Aita for telling my sister to close the door?	"Here's another one about my darling sister Elizabeth. There's probably going to be a lot more posts about her since we're always fighting and I'm constantly asking myself if I'm the problem. 
This is going to be a short one. 

Okay, so, we have four small dogs. Oscar (he's in another story of mine) is a chihuahua/mini pinscher, Winnie is a Maltese/shih tsu, and Luna and Rosie are their babies, so they're mutts. They are my life and I honestly don't know how I ever lived without them. 

Elizabeth has a habit of leaving the main front door open and not closing the screen door all the way. This gives the dogs the opportunity to escape. There was actually an incident last New Year's Eve where she did just that. Me and my other sister Renè had just got back from the grocery store and the liquor store and we were unloading her trunk, me with my paper bag of fireball and rum in hand. Rosie and Luna see that we've pulled up and they go to the screen door to wait for us. Well, we were taking too long and they started pushing on the screen door. I watched as the screen door opened and I immediately start sprinting to the door to make sure they don't get out but I ended up tripping on the curb. The liquor bottles fall first and I go sliding across the concrete. The crash of the bottles alert my mom and she runs outside to make sure I'm okay, closing the front door with her. Elizabeth comes too. I'm mostly okay, aside from the road rash and glass in my legs. I'm asked what happened and I tell them that someone forgot to close the door and the dogs almost got out. Elizabeth rolls her eyes and says I'm overreacting and that they were perfectly fine with the door not being secured like that. I went off on her. I'm bleeding, smelling like booze, and I'm livid at the blatant disregard to our dogs safety. She didn't care and somehow she thought I was at fault. 

Anyway, today she did the same thing. I KNOW that door wasn't closed all the way, so I said

""Elizabeth, close the door"". She went ballistic on me. Saying things like ""you're being a bitch. You just HAVE to control everything don't you? Get your fat ass off your high horse and actually do something with your life!"" This coming from the girl who's spent a full year (still going too) in diversion when all she really needed to do was stay sober for 90 days. Oh I'm also apparently an asshole because I won't give her any of my alcohol (I keep it in my locked bedroom so she can't steal it).

c74f7u	2019-06-29 20:50:27	puffycheetopuff	AITA for not going on a second date with a guy because he doesn’t wear a helmet on his motorcycle?	"Sorry for formatting on mobile.

A couple weeks ago I met this guy at a friend’s party, and it turns out we have a lot of mutual friends. We hit it off, exchange numbers, and decide to go on a date. When the date comes it’s nice and overall goes pretty well. He mentions he rides a motorcycle, and we didn’t go into much detail about it as I know nothing about motorcycles. 

By the end of the date, we both agree we had a fun time and would like to go on a second date. We leave the restaurant together, and his bike is right out front. We say goodbye, and he hops on it to leave. I noticed he didn’t put on a helmet, so I asked if he wore one and he said no. I didn’t say anything about it and just went to my car to go home. Now that’s not illegal in my state, but ultimately I think it’s a stupid and reckless decision and it left a bad taste in my mouth. So I decided I wouldn’t want to go on a second date because I can’t comprehend why he wouldn’t just wear a helmet.

Next day he texts me to see if I could go on a second date next week. I explained why i didn’t want to go on a second date as it’s really unsafe to not wear a helmet, and he blew up at me and started getting our friends involved. He just got mad started calling me names saying he’s a safe driver, but no matter how safe you are you can’t control what other drivers might do. Ultimately our mutual friends seem split. Some think it’s a reasonable reason to not want a second date, others think I’m being ridiculous. 

Ultimately I just told him I think it’s reckless and unsafe, and didn’t say much else. I didn’t wanna come off as trying to be preachy or trying to sound like a mom. I just wanted to be honest and not lie.

And my mom called me today asking if she could take her to her exam in my car and proctor it (I’m the only one with a handbrake) and I told her no and my mom bitched me out and said “I didn’t think you’d react this way” I explained that I already told the friend no and my mom said that she was asking me and it wasn’t because the friend had said anything to her.
I don’t want to let her borrow it for multiple reasons 

-she failed her first test
-I’ve never seen her drive ever
-I’m not comfortable with someone driving my car when I’m not there 
-my mom is also a terrible driver and she’d be driving the car for the day 
- I have a broken oil pressure sensor that goes off every couple of minutes when you first start driving and I don’t want this to cause the girl to fail the test or cause her to crash the car if she gets scared of the noise when she’s already scared of the test 
-she’s known about her drivers test for 4 months and still hasn’t figured out a car even though it’s Wednesday, and frankly I don’t see why that’s my fault 

Some things to note 
- the car is under my parents name but I bought it, this is because I was still young when I bought it and they wanted to do it this way so I could be on their insurance 
-I am friendly with this girl but I barely let anyone drive my car. I don’t even let my sister drive my car. I wouldn’t let my mom drive unless it was an emergency"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c74b9s	2019-06-29 20:40:41	shittipper1817191	AITA for tipping less than the suggested amount?	I went to dinner with a large group last night. When the checks came out, the waitress said something about foregoing automatic gratuity because one of my friends was a regular or something, to me it seemed like a play for better tips, which worked because everyone but me tipped like 20-25%, since the split bills were all pretty small. The receipts all had suggested tips, 15 18 and 20%, and mine ended up falling below 15, I honestly didn’t pay attention to the suggestions. My friends started by roasting me and it escalated to kind of an argument. They’re saying that she deserved the tip and was a good waitress for a group our size. I think she didn’t do anything besides just her job? Am I crazy? She didn’t make our drinks or food, she just had to ask more people than usual what good they wanted.

c74b17	2019-06-29 20:40:10	BJSucksOnDick	AITA for causing a scene in a thrift store?	So I’m clearing out my closet and I filled up two bags to donate to the thrift store. When I got there with my GF we told the lady working at the counter we had two bags to drop off, under the impression that we would receive points for a coupon. She rang the points up, but when I looked at the receipt I noticed she only rang up one bag, leaving us a few points short of that coupon. I walk back to the counter and ask a different lady why it only says one and she tells me that I only get one bag a day, right after she was told we had, and already donated two. Now, I walk over to the pile and attempt to remove one of the bags, so I can come back another day and get my points, but my GF steps in front of me and refuses to let me take back a donation. Instead of causing an even larger scene in the store, I tell her that I will be dropping her off and she is wrong for causing a scene in the store. On my way back to her house, I feel remorseful, but regretful, so I go back to the store and take half of my clothes back.	Asshole	0	0
c74a0y	2019-06-29 20:37:42	PikminWarlord	AITA for getting upset at my S/O and best friend over a potential birthday gift ?	"Long time lurker here , first time poster .

It will be my birthday within the next month , and my girlfriend is very excited about it and wants to make it special for me .

This is where I need to ask AITA.  I’ve had a friend to over 4 years , since middle school.  He lives a couple states away and he’s a great dude .  Problem is , he’s in a REALLY shit situation right now .  He’s 19 and is currently unemployed , and has a maximum of 100 dollars in his bank account at any given moment .  He’s excited for my birthday and he was talking with my GF about potential gifts.

Let me preface this by I already despise getting gifts .  I already think spending anything on me is a waste of money , but I can excuse with my GF because I spoil her equally, if not more .  

But this gift was a gag gift .  It was around 45 dollars , and it was entirely ironic .  As in , the type you open up , have a shitty giggle , and never use again.

Anyway , this actually upset me .  This dude is already in a shit situation and has to live with his parents far longer than he originally intended , and currently hardly has enough money to get this and repair his laptop (which he uses for his potential next job) .

She didn’t say what it was for a couple minutes (for context , it was a really shitty hoodie ) , but after pretty sternly saying “if you send my address to him, I will be seriously upset”.  She eventually got the memo , but in fear of her sending it regardless I had to message him .  He said that he was “slightly disappointed” , but still got the general idea.

AITA for not letting one of my best friends not get me a gift for a “pretty significant year” because I don’t want him to literally waste money on me ?

Edit:  going to just add a couple things here , mentioned it a lot in comments and decided to add a couple of things I left out

1: he should / kind has to save as much money as possible .  He currently does a lot of things online (for money, entertainment , etcetera) and this past month his laptop broke , and he’s hoarding the last remnants of money his last job gave him to hopefully have enough to pay for the repairs .  I don’t want to inadvertently lose this mans future career and happiness over a hoodie. 

2. I see a lot of “propose a new gift”, which we ended up actually doing .  We went through a lot of websites and ended up finding some really cool , cheaper stuff .    


I may edit this a bit more depending on what other people have to say , but these are the two more important one , thanks again"	Asshole	0	0
c748qh	2019-06-29 20:34:45	pinkfluffs	AITA for not forcing my fiance back into a friendship with my mom and brother?	" 

Quick  background. My fiance and I have been together for almost 6 years and  are getting married Spring 2020. We met because my brother was best  friends with him and as my fiance came around we got to know each other  and fell in love, started dating a year later. Throughout all of this my  fiance and brother remained friends but they would fight every so often  about different little things (they actually fight more than my fiance  and I do). My mom also took in my fiance as a ""second son"" and just being a people pleaser to him.

More recently. About 5 months ago my brother and fiance went to dinner  together as friends. My fiance had 3 beers with dinner and my brother said he felt like my fiance was choosing  drinking over him and he was being used as a DD. My brother left my fiance with no notice at the restaurant and drove back to his apartment.  My fiance then paid for the entire dinner and bought an uber home.  However, this pissed my fiance OFF. He has a big thing with being  abandoned which he felt like he was by my brother. So he cut my brother  off.

A  month after the incident my mom gets involved and wants them to ""patch  things up"" and return to being best buddies. Mom also says she's mad at  my fiance for going to far with punishing my brother and he needs to get  over it and man up. Anyway, fiance and brother have a small talk and  basically my fiance is done being his friend because they always fight  over things like this and my fiance has pretty much outgrown my brother.

So  today we are at a point where my fiance is not mad at my mom or  brother, just neutral. He is fine going to family events and talking  with them, but he no longer wants to be the over buddy family son.  Basically, he just wants to have a normal family relationship where you  get along and see each other but no longer rainbows and sunshine perfect  world where everyone lives together type of thing. But NOW my mom is  being persistent that he's being rude and an ass for not talking it out  and basically going back to how it was a long time ago with best friends  and being really close. Her main bother being that my brother would've  been best man and now no longer is since that event.

I  just don't know what to do or how to get this fixed. Like I said my  fiance is fine and not mad at anyone. But he just wants to be cordial  and see them here and there, not everyday like it used to be. I don't  know how to approach my mom to tell her to back off.

TL;DR!  My fiance and I have been together for 6 years. My fiance is also best  friends with my brother for 7 years. Earlier this year my fiance and  brother got into a fight and my fiance doesn't want to be best friends  anymore, just casual generic family. My mom is involved and wants to  force everyone into being best friends again. How do I get her to  understand things don't have to be her way and it's okay that they're  not best friends. Or am I in the wrong?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c7487j	2019-06-29 20:33:25	filmfest_throwaway	AITA for refusing to compensate or credit my friend in a film that’s loosely based on his childhood trauma?	"
Using a throwaway because it’s   possible to figure out my identity if I post on my main account. (However, I am in no way famous and have yet to achieve any form of mainstream success with my work). 

I recently made a low-budget indie film that is loosely inspired by some childhood trauma a friend of mine experienced. He’s confided in me slowly about these events throughout the years. I found his story to be tragic but also extremely interesting from a creative perspective. (I should note that my friend is not a writer and, as far as I know, he has little to no interest in the arts). 

The film is now done, with the exception of some last minute edits that need to be made. All names of people, places, etc. have been changed. The dialogue is entirely my own, and so are nearly all of the details. Still, given my source of inspiration, I asked my friend to be among the first to view the film. I kept the plot a surprise, which I admit was a precarious decision. Thankfully, he loved it and provided only positive feedback after the viewing. However, a few days later—I believe, after speaking with someone about it—his attitude changed significantly. 

My friend has now requested (1) some form of credit in the film’s opening lines and (2) a small percentage of the profits. (I have no idea what #2 would look like even if I agreed, since calculating profits can be an extremely complicated endeavor. There is also a significant chance that there will be no profits to distribute. However, I suppose we could come to some agreement about compensation, if I were so inclined). 

I happen to have several lawyers in my family. I am confident that, based on the specific circumstances at play here, I have no legal obligation to accommodate either of my friends requests. At least for now, this is a moral issue rather than a legal one. (I am sure some could make arguments about the legalities but I am **not** looking for legal advice at this time, and I would not post in this forum for that purpose, in any case). 

What I am wondering is - do I have some moral duty to oblige my friend’s requests for acknowledgement and/or money?

Thank you in advance for any responses."	Asshole	0	0

c747rg	2019-06-29 20:32:19	ChunkyPussyFarts	AITA for choosing to rent an affordable house instead of letting my friend rent it?	"I am moving out of my apartment and renting a small house. For the past 2 months, I have been searching for rentals, talking to realtors, touring places and adjusting my deal-breakers until finally, I have found the perfect place that is very affordable for the area but still gives me the space I want and the location that I want.  I asked my friend to come with me to tour the place and that led to a heated discussion.

She is married, living with her husband, and they qualified for subsidized housing. However, when it came time for them to re-qualify, it turns out that they just barely make over the income limit due to both of them getting raises, but they are literally a couple hundred dollars over. Not enough to afford an actual apartment. 

When I showed her the pictures of the house that I was going to tour and the price, she asked if I could forgo the house and get an apartment since I make way more than their combined income (which is true) and since I didn't need as much space (I'm single). She said without the house that I am looking at, they will have to take out loans to afford an actual apartment. I said no because I have been putting in all this work to find the house, and while I do make more money than them on paper, in reality, I have other expenses that sop up that extra money (student loans, auto loan, savings goals etc).  We didn't fight but it was heated and she said that she didn't want to come tour anymore.

c746ky	2019-06-29 20:29:12	runndle	AITA for moving out of my house like this?	"I (30, F) moved into a new place in May, in a city I moved to for a job. It's a shared house with one roommate (34, F), month-to-month with utilities included. I had no signed lease and I did not pay a deposit.

One day, I'm laid off. I hadn't been in the area long enough to form deep connections in my industry, and the job market there was competitive. After a few weeks of job hunting and a couple of heart-to-heart conversations with my brother and my best friend, everyone agreed it was time for me to take an indefinite visit back home, which is 1,700 miles away.

I made a plan to buy a 1-way flight, find work back home and stay with my family while continuing to pay rent at my shared house until I can afford to come back for my belongings.

Well, what I didn't expect is that, although there are plenty of well-paying oilfield jobs in my hometown, it takes a long time for recruiters/HR to respond to applications. This is normal, I'm told, so everyone's advising me to be patient.

But, the amount I'd pay for rent would REALLY be helpful to have while I'm still job hunting. So, on June 17, I let my roommate know that my friend (whom she's met), would be coming by to collect my belongings. 

She seems sort of okay with this arrangement in the beginning, and just asks that my friend contact her to schedule a time when she can be home. But she stops responding to his messages and refuses to agree to a time - any time - in June, that would work for my friend. Instead, he'd have to come sometime in July, she says. And she's requiring me to pay rent for July because I didn't give her 30 days notice that I'd be moving out. I can get my belongings, she says, once I've paid July rent.

I stop responding to her messages because she's becoming hateful. My friend and I agree that it would be best if he just went to the house one day while she's at work and collect my things, so that's what he does. I emailed him a very detailed list of what belonged to me in each room. That worked great, only he ended up packing a piece of pottery that was hers, and taking it to his house two hours away.

She called me - repeatedly - that night, telling me that I violated her space (which was, technically, also my space until the end of the month, I remind her) and she even threatens to report it as a burglary to the police. I explain that the pottery thing was an honest mistake, I send her a photo of the piece that my friend had sent me to verify that's what was missing, and the pottery is sent back to her after a couple of days. But the thing is, until she got that package in the mail, I had to block her phone number and social media accounts because the accusations just wouldn't stop. I'd get voicemails in the middle of the night that were 4, 5 minutes long. She'd call me and, if I answered, she'd rant for 5 minutes and then hang up when I tried to defend myself. Now that it's over, I don't expect I'll ever have to hear from her again, but... am I the asshole here?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c746kl	2019-06-29 20:29:11	throwitawayyyy_yyyy	WIBTA if I told my mom to stop borrowing my money from me without asking even though I know she'll give it back?	"Throwaway because I don't want this linked to my main account.

I'm going to keep this relatively brief.

I'm 23 and since I was 17 and first got a bank account, my mom's account is linked to mine so she has had access to it. It helped a lot when I was in high school and she was able to transfer me money straight out of her account for lunch or movie tickets or whatever when I didn't have a job (this was before Venmo/Cashapp/Zelle made transferring money a lot easier) but now that I'm a recent college graduate looking for work things are a little different.

Like I said, I'm looking for work right now and all I have in my account is a small amount of money I got as graduation gifts, birthday money, and a little from my campus job. In total, it's only about one thousand dollars. This is holding me over until I find a full-time job, and since I still live with my mom (need money to move out, need job to get money) and she doesn't charge me rent, I use the money for gas (I drive my brother to PT appointments twice a week), groceries (I cook dinner every day for our whole family), and student loan payments. The money should last me a few months, but it's really not much, so I'm being really conservative with my spending.

Recently, my mom got a new job, and because her paychecks got all fucked up from switching jobs, just this week she took $250 from my account to cover the car insurance payment, and then she took another $700 yesterday to cover other bills she'd paid in advance so her account wouldn't get overdrawn. She will give the money back when she gets paid, but I hate that she didn't ask me for the money.

This also isn't the first time she'd done this. She does it quite frequently, and sometimes she forgets to pay me back when she gets paid and I have to remind her to give back my money, which makes me feel like an asshole.

I love my mom, and I am *GLAD* to help if she needs it. She's such a huge help to me and she's very supportive of me, especially right now when I am struggling to find work. However, because she has access to my account she can just take however much from me she wants without asking and just say ""I'll pay you back"" and I just feel so violated. If she asked me before she took the money I wouldn't be so upset over it but it's so frustrating to look at my account balance knowing I'm supposed to have a thousand dollars and only having $50.

Because of this, I'm thinking about talking to her and just telling her to stop taking money from me without asking. Either that or just closing that account and making a new one separate from hers. I'm happy to help her if she needs, but I want to be the one helping her, I don't want her to use my funds like a piggy bank.

c742qd	2019-06-29 20:19:45	Niggynots	AITA for leaving and coming back?	So today i planned to go to my best friends house. Along the way minor things happened that upset me that i brushed off however when i was playing the switch with my best friend i misunderstood what he asked about the game and i accidentally spoiled something to do with the game, he rage quit, called me an assortment of names and left the room. I told him that if hes going to do that i might as well go home to which he replied with by telling his parents to take me home (doesnt live within range of public transport) which then makes his parents ask me why, i tell them essentially what is typed above and my best friend tells them that i have been holding onto the minor issues i had all day and that it was ruining the day for him (bearing in mind literal minutes prior we were laughing and having fun on smash) and his parents offer to take me home, i ask my best friend if thats what he wants and his response was to walk away and not talk to me which i saw as a confirmation that he wanted me to go. So his dad drives me back and during the car ride he texts me constantly saying that he never wanted me to leave and that everybody leaves him and he has nobody ect. And after hearing all of that i asked him if he wanted me to come back and he says again that he never wanted me to leave, so i ask his dad if i can grab some things (by this point we were outside my flat) and we headed back to my best friends house, during the car ride we almost got into an accident because somebody was speeding. When we got back to his house him and his mom tell me that i shouldn't have ran away and came back and that he didnt want me back. I tell his mom about the texting and she said that it doesnt matter and they again raise the problems i had earlier (of which i forgotten about) and tell me that i shouldnt have came back. We argued for a bit about the whole situation which felt like gaslighting to me and now im in my best friends room crying because his parents refuse to let me book a taxi (i dont get paid for a while) and his dad cant drive back now.

c740e4	2019-06-29 20:13:52	dumbodowner	AITA for riding my longboard in my neighborhood?	"So, my neighborhood consists of one fairly long main road, with some streets that extend off the side.  This road is nice for long boarding because it has just enough of a slant/hill to gain a fair amount of speed without being too much. It's enough speed to where I can't just stop, I have to ride down to the bottom where the road is flat again and I can slow down. It's hard to explain, but the hill starts about halfway down this road, with the front half not being a hill. Before I ride this hill I always make sure there are no cars coming behind me.  Every now and then, a car has come up from behind but they are always kind and let me finish my route as it's pretty short.. they might have to wait 10 or 15 seconds for me to finish up.  

One day, I was riding this hill and about halfway down I had a car coming up from behind. The guy must have been speeding to have caught up to me so fast, as I checked back to make sure nobody was coming when I initially started. He got very impatient and honked at me. My response was to give him the middle finger, which I will admit was probably a poor choice.  He then proceeds to side swipe me with his car (while I am still riding on the board), not hard enough to hurt me but enough to where it knocked me off the board.  Long story short, things got verbal and he got out of the car wanting to fight me, to which my response was I didn't want any violence. I am not a violent person. He got in his car and left. This guy ended up going back to his house, grabbing another person whether it be a friend or relative, and coming back to my house knocking on the door.  It was really over the top.  

Now, this guy is definitely an asshole. My question is, am I an asshole for riding my longboard on the main road given the possibility of a car coming?

c73z20	2019-06-29 20:10:49	bisonis1989	AITA for firing my aunt and refusing to help her financially?	"My grandparents had 4 children: my mom, my aunt, and two sons, both passed years ago. They were owners of an inn and a restaurant. I went to Business school, so I've been running the family business since grandparents retired. My aunt stole money from my grandparents twice to handle it to two different scammers, so she was excluded from their will. Also, they didn't trust the sons' widow and ex-wife, mothers to the other grandkids. So I and my parents became the only heirs to their money with the promise that we would help my cousins with their education, money for college tuition and related expenses. They named me the new owner and told me that the earnings were mine, I only have to share the wealth.

My aunt only gives me headaches. Before my grandparents died, she would only visit her own parents to ask them money, even when they were sick in bed. She wasn't in need,  she doesn't pay for rent, she lives in a house that now belongs to my mom, and her children are financially independent. She always runs out of money because she spends it all on junk food and weight control drugs. She is a religious fanatic, the kind that goes to three different churches so she can go to service six days a week. I have nothing against her faith, but I'm sure she gives large amounts of money to the churches.  

After my grandparents died, I fired my aunt. She used to work at my restaurant and she was terrible for the work environment. Her behavior was similar to Colin Farrell's character in the movie Horrible Bosses. I kept her in a close to minimum wage role, but she would give orders to employees in higher positions, just because she is the owners' daughter. I had to tell my staff to ignore her and only listen to me or the manager. I had problems with guests and customers because of her lack of social skills.  

I told her that she has enough years of work experience to look for a job elsewhere and that I won't give her any extra money. I allowed her to stay at the place she lives, but clarify that the place is not hers, I'm just lending. My grandparents gave me the order to help my cousins, they did not mention her. 

My mom thinks I am the asshole. She claims my aunt is not mentally stable due to a head injury she suffered after being hit by a car when she was a kid. She had postpartum depression and depression after her two divorces and the scams. I feel bad for her, but she is useless at work and it is not fair for me to work hard and give money for her to spend in futile stuff.

INFO: I gifted my aunt's daughter with a part of the heritage to help to pay for her wedding.

A couple of years ago my dad stopped smoking because is asthma really flared up. My mum stopped a couple years before him and I was really happy about it. They’re heavy drinkers which my sister is very opposed to but me and my brother tolerate however all three of us HATE when they smoke.

For several reasons, but the main ones being- my dad has asthma and at a young age we’ve had the whole ‘smoking = cancer’ drilled into our brains. 

Last week my parents went on holiday without the kids as a lil treat, and it was fine. They’re back now and they’re pretty drunk from a pool party (yay for Europe’s heat wave. You’d think England had never seen the fucking sun) my dad came over to me and said ‘just to let you know, your mum wants a cigarette. I’m telling you now so you’re not mad later if you see’ and obviously I got pissed. I asked why she suddenly craved one after years of not smoking. Apparently all holiday they’ve had a pack a fucking day. I’m obviously fuming and my dad says ‘you only live once’ and goes outside with my mum. I know where he hides his packets so I took one of the packets and hid it. 

I went outside to get my dog in and my mum, being very drunk and bit of a cow when she’s drunk went ‘oh here we go! You come out here to moan? I’m an adult I’m allowed to!’ When I said literally nothing. My dad told her to stop but she persisted to the point where I’m in tears. She said ‘we’re not bad parents! You could have it so much worse off!’ I said I never said they were bad parents, I said they’re shortening their life spans. 

After this whole interaction I’m worried what’s gonna happen when they realise the cigarettes are missing. Am I the asshole for hiding them? I get that their adults and it’s their choice but I wanna be fucking selfish and have my parents live longer."	Asshole	0	0

I'm 18. My friend family doesn't have much money and he isn't going yo college and stuff next year cause they can't afford and he needed 70 euro from me to get new glasses cause someone in school broke his old ones and they didn't get in trouble. His parents told him that they will not get him new ones because he should have been more careful which I think is bullshit since they guys did it on purpose. He hasn't had glasses for months and cannot see properly. He asked me last week if he can borror 70 euro from me and I said of course if he can pay me back and we agreed and he said he would. Today I was about to give him the 70 euro and went to specs avers with him but then he said he'd repay me over the next few years. That's ridiculous. How does it take that long to pay someone back €70?? I told him I wasn't going to give it back to him if he couldn't pay me back in a reasonable time. I'm going on holidays next week and I'd rather keep that money if someone is going to take that long to repay me. He's been really begging me for that 70 euro but I told him if he wanted glasses that back he should get a job.

My uncle became a born again Christian last year, and eventually roped my grandma in with him. Around Christmas last year, my grandma asked us to all go with them to church as her present. We obliged, but it was NOTHING like the Catholic Churches I’ve been to, this was full blown fanatical Christian shit. People on the floor crying and praying, the pastor yelling and making a huge show out of the whole thing. It honestly scared me, but my mom said it was just that one time. Well, ever since then, any time we visit I somehow get forced into going, and it’s not just a Sunday thing, she goes 3 times a week. This last time, I had it. I told my grandma I had no interest in her church as it made me uncomfortable and I wouldn’t be going.

I have a question for my boyfriend, but I’m unsure if it would be appropriate to ask. 
 
To preface, I trust and love my boyfriend 100%. I just want to know what’s up, as something obviously is.
 
My boyfriend has been leaving to go a hobby of his 2 hours early, even though it should only take 1 hour. For the sake of this story I’m going to call the hobby bowling. 
 
To takes 30 mins to get to the bowling place from our home. He stops and picks up a friend which is about 30 mins out of the way. So round trip is an hour. Maybe an hour & 20 depending on traffic. 
 
 
I’m not afraid that he’s “cheating” as we are poly. 
 
Lately, my boyfriend has been hinting at a proposal. We’ve dated 6 years and talked about it before. We both want to be married some day. 
 
Maybe he leaves an extra hour early to plan something for a proposal? But he’s done this the past 4 times he’s gone bowling. He also seems to have less spending money than before. 
 
 Something just seems weird to me. Not in a way that I think he’s up to something, but in a way that I have a mild amount of concern. 
 
WIBTA if I asked him about it? 
 
Second, WIBTA if I snooped on his phone if he doesn’t give me a straight answer? We have blanket permission to look at each other’s electronics. 
 
Edit: I forgot to mention. I subtly asked before and he said something like “traffic is bad”. I know that’s a lie as I used to go bowling with him (including picking up the friend). I also checked the route on waze."	Asshole	0	0
c73uyw	2019-06-29 20:01:14	Random_Etymology	AITA for ruining my friends chance of playing with a huge local band?	"I live in a small town. Recently, a local band that made it somewhat big and become a small fraction of famous held a contest thing where other bands could play and they’d choose the winners to open for them at a big venue in our state.

My friends and I already have a band, and we decided to enter. I play the drums and the friend in question is a guitarist.

The day comes and we play. Now, in the song we played, there’s a very nice drum fill. Throughout the song is a beat that I messed around with a lot that’s pretty fun to play. Sounds like some reggae infused rock shit.

After we play we our outside the thing taking some pictures with friends. My drum kit is near and my friend decides to sit on my throne cause he’s tired. I don’t give a shit.

A guy from another band competing comes up and starts talking to me and and another band mate. Things are all well and good and he asks about the drums. So with my friend still at the throne, I take my sticks and play some of it kinda softly on the toms and shit. I throw the sticks back in the bag and walk to go piss and finish my conversation. 

On my way back from the bathroom, my friend is talking to the members of the main band. I’m in awe, but by the time I get up there, they’ve left to go talk to others or whatever.

I ask my friend what happened and he said they saw him at the drums and heard me playing and fucking around a minute ago, and assumed he was the drummer. He never corrected their mistake, and they wanted to talk to him later and possibly jam. He even bullshited coming up with what I played.

I’m immedialty pissed because not only is that my drum fill, it was my playing that he took credit for. I tell him he’s an ass for doing it and he gets defensive and says I’m terrible for trying to take away his chance to play with them. He try’s to use his recent relationship turmoil to his favor but I’m still pissed.

Eventually I walk away from him and we as a band get a chance to talk to the famous band. My friend begs me not to tell them but I do anyway and they’re kinda stunned and chuckle a little. They make some reason to leave and we didn’t see them again. 

Now my friend thinks I’m the asshole for ruining his chance to play with them. Despite him being not the god damn drummer. Or a drummer for that matter.

I dont like confrontation, and will often bottle up the way i feel about things till they blow over. Well, unfortunately the way my mom is never blew over and i exploded on her the other day. She is not mean to my kids in any way, in fact it's quite the oposite. I don't think she means to, but she babies the fuck out of them. ( 3&4 ) She constantly tries to parade and show off my kids like they are her own or as if they are trophies. When we go out, she puts on their ""favorite song"" (she thinks she discovered their love for michael jackson, she didnt) to make them dance in public and act cute. My daughter is shy so never does. Me and my husband were having a discussion on putting the kids in pre K and she jumped in about a pre K down the road being free and took it upon herself to call around about some places for us to give us the information. If i take my daughters hair out of a braid cause she asked me too, shell constantly try to force her to want it back in. She acts like she is the reason for my kids love of certain things, buys things for them even though i ask not too, and just all around acts weird with them. My biggest thing that bugs me and my husband that is hard to describe is that she subtly acts like the kids are hers. I habe NO doubt in my mind that if she takes them out just her, she will say they are hers. I have always been quiet about it besides saying no when it comes to certain things, but today when she tried to over power me at breakfast by having MY kids sit with her instead of me, and trying to tell the waitress what to give them instead of me. I snapped when we were leaving and told her to stop trying to act like my kids are hers, she already parented me and my step sister and now she needs to let me be a parent. She quietly left but my step dad pulled me aside later and told me i was an asshole for doing that and that she is just trying to be a good grandparent so the kids love her.

c73tgf	2019-06-29 19:57:31	Every1OnRedditIsScum	AITA for ignoring my neighbors?	"Every day around lunch time, I (36m) come home real quick and make something to eat during my work day.

I park in a back alley where my parking spot is, go in my place for 20 minutes and then I’m gone.

Yesterday, when I was in my car and getting ready to leave; my neighbor’s boyfriend comes out of his gate and starts staring at me and talking shit.

I can’t hear what he’s saying because I’m in my car and was adjusting the radio. But, I can see him in my rear view.

He’s mad dogging and I can read his lips to see he’s dropping several F bombs and directing them at me.

I have a short fuse for this sort of thing, so I immediately get an adrenaline rush and my first instinct is to get out of my car and ask him what he said and beat his ass if it comes to that.

However, I’m older, I’m wiser. He’s my fucking neighbor’s boyfriend. 

So I decide to make a three point turn in the alley and drive toward him slowly.

When he gets close, he’s preparing to say something as he’s following me with his eyes.

That’s when I decide to smile at him and wave.

His demeanor went from angry to “oh hey, what’s up” and he gave me a head nod.

After this happened, I was trying to recollect on why he was angry at me or appeared to be and could only think of one thing.

The day before yesterday, his girlfriend (my neighbor) was in her garage. I got off work and was walking to my place.

She looked at me with the same mean mug face that she always gives me when I see her (which is why I didn’t say hello, nor have I even introduced myself) and I just minded my business and acted as if she wasn’t there.

Despite that, I could feel her eyes on me. Zeroed in on me as she’s thinking what a piece of shit I am for existing in her presence.

Every other neighbor I am cordial with and know their first name and they know mine. But, not this neighbor.

I thought about introducing myself when I first met her and her boyfriend, but the first time I met the girlfriend, she was blaring her car’s horn in the alley for 10 minutes straight because she wanted her mom to come out.

And the first time I met her boyfriend, he was helping her unload stuff from their car and he was staring at me like I was invading their personal space when I parked my car and walked to my place.

So, fuck it. I ignore them.

And that is the only thing that I could possibly think of that makes me an asshole.

Maybe she thinks I’m stuck up, maybe she told her boyfriend I was being rude to her. Who knows."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I mentioned this as a general life update when I was speaking with my daughter’s dad. (We platonically co-parent, I have custody, and he usually pays child support. This info may or may not be relevant later.)

I didn’t ask for anything in reference to the car situation, just mentioned my struggles with my old car and that I wasn’t sure it was worth repairing and asking his opinion about whether he would repair it or get a different functioning vehicle. 

He suggested a different vehicle and I told him I was browsing for a used vehicle to replace it. He took it upon himself and bought me my little car. 

I didn’t want to take it. He reassured me it was fine, it’s a gift to help {our daughter}’s mom. I was reluctant, but I agreed and profusely thanked him. 

From the outset, he never discussed repayment and always referred to it as a present or gift. It wasn’t a new car (it’s a 2009) but it has been exactly what I need and a good little car for me. Great gas mileage, no issues. 

About a year ago, he somewhat randomly declares that “it’s about time you pay me back for the car” and then proceeds to stop paying child support for the duration of the time it would be to pay him back for the car. 

No actual conversation or discussion in the matter and no inquiry into whether it suits my financial situation. He wouldn’t answer calls or texts, ignored emails, and didn’t visit our kid. He clearly avoided the topic and just genuinely dropped off the face of the earth for the several months it took for the car to be “paid back”.

Still, months after it was all repaid, refuses to discuss it. It’s like he completely shuts off the second I try to talk about it. 

Clearly, I’m still angry about it. It’s not about the money. My finances were fine for the duration. It’s not about the value of the car, as it was exactly what I was looking for at the time. It’s about his expectation that gifts require repayment, that he prioritized the money over his child, and that I don’t get to discuss it with him because he won’t talk to me about it.

I know that there are some funky things going on legally, but at the end of the day I want to know where I stand.

c73ooh	2019-06-29 19:46:10	polaropposite5	WIBTA if I called CPS on my brother?	"Today I was at my moms house helping her move some stuff. My grandpa, oldest brother, youngest brother, my cousin, and my oldest brothers girlfriend lives in a three bedroom townhouse. 

My oldest brother, “Dan”, is basically a piece of shit. He has several other children with multiple women whom he doesn’t keep in contact with nor support any of his other children. His girlfriend, “Jen”, lives with him with the other people I mentioned before. Jen and Dan have a one year old, “Kate”. Previously I had lived with all of them, the house was always disgusting when I lived there. Garbage literally all over the floor, random shit everywhere. My grandpa is an alcoholic who can barely walk anywhere. So, the house is always disgusting. 

So, I went upstairs to Jen and Dan’s room to get a box of picture for my mom. I haven’t seen Kate since I moved out because my grandpa is a dick, and Dan just sucks as a human being. As I walked upstairs, Jen was in the bathroom that is basically the master bath which has a door that is connected to their room. She was doing her makeup and I walked into Dan and Jen’s room and saw Katie sitting on the floor surrounded by piles of random shit, clothes, toys, garbage, etc. In another end of the room, was a large black garbage bag, which I’m assuming was garbage due to the fruit flies swarming it. It was probably the worst I’ve ever seen their room from previous times. Kate looked like she hadn’t had a bath in awhile and I felt very upset that they were allowing their room to be in this condition, let alone a one year old. 

I told my mom that it was absolutely horrid in there. And she could see the high level of disgust in my face and said, “don’t do anything”. Meaning not to call cps despite the living conditions of the house and their bedroom. 

So, WIBTA for calling cps? I should also mention that Dan is a hot head, and is very abusive in several ways. So I would be worried that in some way, cps showing up and my recent visit would connect the dots for him and I would potentially be in danger. He has threatened physics assault towards me before.

c73niy	2019-06-29 19:43:28		AITA for not showing up	"My bff had planned to meet up a bunch of her friends today (that I haven't met in person yet but I'm in a group chat with them) and I had mentioned (some two weeks ago) that maybe it would be a nice time to meet them. It happened that I was invited two days before to a cousin's birthday party and to my parents (with whom I live) that takes priority over friend gatherings which can be postponed. So I thought I'd go with my family and meet her friends afterwards. I missed track of the hours and ended up calling her to tell me where they were two hours later than I was supposed to (by which point they were already leaving). She yelled ridiculously at me non-stop for some 2/3 minutes, saying we would talk later when she was not pissed at me which wouldn't be so soon (I swear the only thing left for her to say is that we should not be friends anymore...). Also, when I meet with her or other friends I'm used to spend the whole afternoon together and not 3 hours like it seemed to have happened, so I was thinking maybe I'd meet them later.

&#x200B;

I know it would be good policy to let her know I would be late (but I never compromised with a specific hour, it was an ""after lunch"" than ended up becoming ""mid afternoon""). I just don't think that's a reason for us to stop talking for a few months which seems like it's going to happen.

Maybe I'm just too used to my regular group of friends on which if someone ended up not showing up we would just be like ""oh well, we'll meet up next time, no big deal""

&#x200B;

Also, I'd never flaked on her if it were just the two of us meeting, but with bigger groups I get this voice in my head that says ""why go? It's not like they'll miss me there""

&#x200B;

In case you answer YTA, tell me what you think I should do in regards to her, since I think an apology won't do much. I'm a much more tolerant person than her and I always feel like I have to walk on eggshells around her; I like her a lot though, we've been friends for over 10 years."	Asshole	1	0

She asked me if I'm definitely okay to work, and I said it should be okay, and I was also getting rid of my restaurant shift so I could work nightclub. The other person got rejected for taking the shift however so I couldn't drop the shift, which was beyond my control. Apparently this didn't make sense to my club boss.

On Thursday night I got a message saying that I'm no longer needed for tonight, so I said that I can be a last resort if the nightclub were completely stuck and needed someone to work. However, I went down to the club last night to collect my wages, I asked if I was definitely not needed and she said no, she is fine for tonight.

Now she is messaging me asking if I can work tonight with two hours notice and having a go at me because I said no as I've already made plans for after work tomorrow, and she told me that I was definitely not needed.

She's now making out that I said I can be a last resort, even though I didn't say it last night, and she said she definitely did not need me to work when I was talking last night.

Here we go, lol. I'm 25M and she is 25F. 

&#x200B;

I'll start this off my saying I'm currently in chemotherapy. If you haven't heard of 'chemo brain', basically I am more forgetful and I'm a little slower on the draw than before I started treatment. My stomach is very touchy and my white blood cell count is low, so finding food I am allowed to eat (allowed by both my stomach and my low bacteria diet) can be difficult. A few days ago, my GF brought back a selection of fruits, including two plums. I am incredibly stoked on these plums and we discuss how awesome they are and how we can't wait to eat them. They go in the refrigerator and our lives continue.

&#x200B;

Flash forward to today. We decide we are going to make some breakfast burritos and venture into the kitchen. She is pulling out the ingredients for the burritos; cheese, eggs, tortillas, beans, peppers, salsa.. these burritos are gonna kick ass. Then she pulls out the bag of fruits from the other day and instantly my mind is set on those juicy, purple, sweet plums I expect to find in the bag. So I pop it open and grab for a plum.. but ain't shit in there but nectarines. HELLO?? NO PLUM FOR ME?? Wait.. maybe it's in a different bag. 

So I ask her, ""Hey, did you eat both of these plums?"" 

and she says ""Yeah."" 

I said ""One of those was for me.""

and she says ""You forgot they were in there so I ate them both.""

&#x200B;

Now keep in mind that instead of apologizing or admitting any fault for eating both plums, she immediately made it my fault that she ate them, and her target reason was my chemo brain. So not only did she eat her plum, but she also ate my plum, knowing how stoked on this plum I was, and her reasoning is that I have cancer and couldn't be trusted to eat it in time.

&#x200B;

So that is this situation. I am considering breaking up with her for the following reason:

\-This is a straw that broke the camel's back, so to say, when it comes to taking responsibility for her own actions. She is the type of person to never apologize or admit fault, and we have had numerous arguments about this facet of her personality. Today she stooped to a new low, depriving her cancer riddled boyfriend of a delicious plum and then blamed her own selfishness on the chemo instead of just saying sorry. If she had simply been like ""Oh yeah lol my bad, I did eat that"" then I wouldn't even be mad. But she just had to, ONCE AGAIN, make this my fault and can't even accept responsibility for eating a GD piece of fruit.

c73kxq	2019-06-29 19:37:05		AITA for talking to one guy while hooking up with another?	"Okay, I just need some advice or opinions maybe. I hope that’s okay. 

I met Max on tinder a few weeks back. We started talking and it is purely sexual/casual. I would probably have been open to more and he was giving me kind of player vibes but because I was insanely attracted to him I ignored the red flags and met up. Predictably, sexy times happened. 

In this time, my mom introduced me to a family friend who, lol, mentioned her son, Tom, who she wanted me to talk to. I know, bit weird but hey. So he slid into my DMs and we started chatting. We couldn’t meet for a little while but started talking. He is really nice. Like, not the type of guy I would normally go for at all. It has just been friendly chat but we have arranged to meet this weekend. 

Max cooled off a lot after our first date. Which I think triggered me into wanting him more (I know, I am an idiot). By this point, I’m realising that he is not interested in anything long term and is essentially treating me as a back up booty call. Regardless we had planned to meet up last night a while back so I kept that in place. We met up, hooked up. There is defo no exclusivity here. I even asked him last night about other girls and he said he was talking to 2 or 3! So my suspicions were confirmed. 

Now I have been talking to Tom all this time and have the date planned. I guess I wanted to sleep with Max for all the wrong reasons and now it’s done, even though the whole situation was a little shit and I’m a bit hung up about it. I don’t feel Max wants to see me again anyway. 

I haven’t even met Tom yet so I didn’t want to put all my eggs in one basket. I’m open to seeing him and if things do go well, I definitely wouldn’t continue talking to others. But I didn’t really think I was doing anything too bad given I hadn’t even had a first date with him. 

My mom however has other ideas. She basically found out about Max, told me I was a “slut” and what I was doing was terrible and I’m a terrible person. And now I’m doubting myself 

Am I still into Max? Well there’s a lot of lust there, he is incredibly attractive and insane in bed but that’s really all we have. Tom? Well I don’t know yet. But he’s definitely sweet and a good guy but I don’t want to make any judgments yet. 

Do I have to tell Tom about Max? Is it really relevant? I know what I did was wrong in the sense I wanted Max and the reason it’s died is more to do with his lack of interest than mine, but did I owe it to Tom not to sleep with him? 

**tldr** Slept with a guy twice, purely casual, and he is certainly a player. In the meantime have been talking to someone who I haven’t met yet but could actually be potentially something more. Have I done something wrong here seeing two guys?"		1	0

Okay so here goes , my wife has a career, friends and activities she does with friends about once a month, she has a big family where we live(Southern California) and we usually have something going on with them about every weekend .(it’s honestly annoying/exhausting )I usually put up with it because as long as I have notice, my anxiety doesn’t interfere with my ability to go . (I’m a Stay-At-Home-Dad with two kids under 4) I have a generous pension from a work injury which pays the majority of the bills and we typically trade off so we each can enjoy free time , the past two weeks she’s been napping more when she gets home, and I  encourage her to do this because I need help by the end of the evening and I cant afford to do it myself if we are both tired, leaving me with little free time and no energy the times I do manage to find an opening . My problem is that I haven’t had any real free time these past few weeks and we yet again have another function going on today, WIBTA if I wiggle my way out of it so I can relax without the kids? How would I explain it to her in a way where she doesn’t get mad at me staying home on such short notice ?	No A-holes here	0	0
c73h56	2019-06-29 19:27:53	momvacationthing	AITA for being upset that my mom is forcing me to go on a vacation with her?	"I should preface this by saying that family isn't really important to me. I love my mom, but she doesn't really matter to me more than my close friends do. I never liked my dad and feel absolutely 0 connection with him whatsoever. My distant cousins, uncles, and aunts are cool, but I see them like I'd see ""my friend's friends who I see sometimes"", if that makes sense. If you immediately go to YTA because I don't want to see my family, then re-read this, imagining my mom being a friend, and my cousins, uncles, and aunts being that friend's friends. I get that my view on family is weird, but I can't control my care for people.

&#x200B;

So I've never really liked vacations, and my mom knows this. There are very few places I actually like going, and I *hate* being in those places for more than a few days at a time. Call me crazy, but vacations just aren't my thing. I work from home, so being forced away is hurtful to work and my daily routine (I can't work on vacation because of how it's all set up). It just makes me crazy stressed, especially if it's not a place I like going to, like in this example.

&#x200B;

With that said, at the beginning of this month, my mom told me that we're going to California to visit my family. I don't like California, being away from home makes me stressed, I don't connect well with this part of my family, and she knows all of these things. None of this really truly set in until today, when she told me that we had to start planning for our leave *tomorrow*. We had somewhat of an argument and I nearly broke down because of the stress this is gonna put on me. She says ""tough luck"", because she already bought the plane ticket for me (which I don't really think it's fair to punish me simply because she assumed I'd want to go, especially when she bought the ticket before I even knew about this trip).

&#x200B;

I'm also kinda worried that I'm gonna break down or have a panic attack while we're there, and it's gonna ruin it for her. I'm not going to be happy, and I'm not going to be able to force myself to be happy. I'm just gonna be miserable, and I feel that it's gonna make her miserable, too.

&#x200B;

But I also feel really bad. I really love my mom, and I want to make her happy, but she shouldn't make me stressed and unhappy just so she can be happy. I'm just conflicted. AITA? :/"	No A-holes here	0	0

I really don't know how to talk to him or anything really because it makes me feel weird to be around him. He takes pictures of me without my permission and stares at me at every family gathering, constantly talking about how pretty I am and my hair and outfit.

I've been able to just sort of politely go about my business at family gatherings, but lately he'll go into where I work and tell me to give him a hug every single day. If he sees me I feel like I have no choice but to give him a hug and it makes me so uncomfortable feeling like I don't have a choice. My parents sort of agree that it's weird but they have no advice for me and other family members have mentioned how depressed he is(he's in his 30s and knows he's missing out to some degree because he has the mental capability of a 7 year old), so I feel terrible.

c73e05	2019-06-29 19:20:14	imunsureanddumb	AITA For being disappointed that a more-than-friends friend of mine had her partner at a party we were both at?	"For the last couple months, I've been talking with and been close to this girl I met named Anna. She is the first person who I've had any feelings for in literally years.

Thing is, she's poly. Because of this and other reasons, we decided to not date. But we still about doing ""stuff"". We were planning on seeing each other this weekend, so I'm very excited. We live about three hours apart from each other, so we don't see each other frequently. She was having a party, mostly because her roommate wanted it, and she wasn't excited about the party. But I figure that she and I will have a good time like we normally do.

I've been looking forward to this because I was expecting it would be me and maybe one or two of her other friends there, with most everyone else being her roommates friends. Thing is, I found out two days ago that one of her partners (one of two) would be there. So I'm a bit disappointed because I was looking forward to spending time with her, but it is what it is. He's in the military. I knew he'd be around in July, but I didn't think he'd be back yet. I wasn't broken up. I get it. I went, drank, and had a good time.

At the end of the night, I was talking with her roommate (who uses they/them pronouns), and I mentioned my disappointment that her partner was there because I had been looking forward to spending time with just her. It was dumb and off-handed. But he and I got along well. I wasn't upset. We had a good time. It's just that my expectations were dashed.

I also talked about my relationship with her. She's close friends with her roommate, so I assumed that they knew about us. But the roommate didn't. I know the roommate, and I generally considered them a friend though not a close one. I'm surprised. I got out to smoke a cigarette, and I start hearing them saying ""oh hell no,"" and ""this isn't happening"" from their window. I tell them that I hear what they're saying to their fiance and because I want to respect their privacy, I ask them to shut their window. They do. I go to bed. Whatever.

I get up in the morning, and me, Anna, and her partner all hang out for a bit before Anna goes to work. About 30 minutes after she's left, I get a call from her where she's in tears and furious. She's angry at me because the roommate claimed that I was mad that her partner was there.All I can say is ""What?"" I try to tell her that I wasn't mad, but she had to go into work. Before she hung up, she said that she doesn't want to talk to me, and that I shouldn't contact her for a long time. So I'm just freaked out. I send her a text explaining my side and that I wasn't angry. Now, maybe the roommate was drunk and didn't remember it correctly. Or maybe they're lying because they have their own motives. But either way, the damage seems done.

c73drz	2019-06-29 19:19:38	whostuhn	AITA For telling off someone’s abusive mom and ruining any possible relationship?	"Me (17m) and my friend (19f) both started to grow feelings for each other and tried to hang out more, but when she told her mom about me, the reaction was less than satisfactory.

She goes to college and they were doing a day where the college rented out an amusement park. We both wanted to go but her mom would not let it slide. So she invited a friend of ours and told her mom that it was just her going. However, I went and eventually got caught. 

Her mom had said that this was disrespectful and was breaking her trust. She took her phone and car (both of which she paid for entirely). 

That’s not even the worst part. She would constantly text me from her phone (not the moms phone) and read our conversations. Telling me again and again that her life is going downhill and she will never need me in her life. I was totally okay with responding maturely ensuring that I would not contact her daughter. However we both happened to work together. We would still talk because the feelings were reciprocated but only at work. 

One day as I was leaving work, her mom texted me, with a screenshot of our conversation from weeks before. She called me out for pressing on hanging out even though her mom had said no. She asked why I pushed even though she said no. 

We got to talking about how I believed that taking away her phone and car, and limiting anything she could do was emotionally abusive. Not to mention the things she would say to her (calling her a c***, saying that the stress she cause will bring back her cancer, etc.) I called her out on this and she said it was just discipline. 

Eventually it got out of hand and I said that her daughter wasn’t happy and she had a fricked up definition of happy. The mom showed her family and now they all hate me, however the daughter forgave me and still wanted something. Last night we agreed that we couldn’t let anything continue which was hard but necessary."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c73dh7	2019-06-29 19:18:55		AITA for being upset over unpaid weekend overtime?	"Hey reddit was I an asshole to my boss?

I had plans for over 2 weeks to go camping this weekend, but on monday my boss told me to plan to work the weekend.

For context, without being too specific, my job is basically drive 2 hours to a location, walk around and take notes, drive to next location, rinse and repeat. I'm paid salary with no overtime compensation. I also work 45+ hours. The overtime compensation that does exist is basically, if you work a weekend, you get a day off. But with my workload its unrealistic to take days off.

On Monday, my boss said I needed to do audits this weekend about 2 hours from town, because a delivery was arriving Saturday night and needed to be checked Sunday. I told him I had plans to go camping, but he just brushed it off and told me I had to be there because the delivery was going to happen Saturday night. Then come Wednesday, the delivery changes to Friday, so now I'm having to work Saturday (today) instead. 

So I cancelled plans (which we had already canceled and remade) with the gf to drive all the way out here this morning. When I arrived on site at noon, I find out the delivery isn't coming until 5pm. It was suppose to be delivered last night. 

I called my boss and left a message basically saying, ""Hey boss, Im on site and the delivery is not going to be here til about 5pm tonight. I dont see any reason to wait around and waste my entire Saturday so I'm going to head back to town to actually try to have a weekend. Audits will get done on Monday.""  

He texted back with ""don't worry about them until monday, sorry you had to work the weekend."" 

Great, I only worked 5 hours for nothing.

Now I'm regretting what I said in the message but I'm still upset about this wasted and UNPAID day. AITA?"		1	0

c73cqe	2019-06-29 19:17:08	counterf3it-life	AITA for leaving my drunk date at the bar?	"So Thursday night I went out with this guy and his friend to a bar. It was only my second time hanging out with the guy I went with & up until this point the guy & I had been texting a little back and forth for a few days but nothing serious. I had to be up early the next morning so I offered to be DD. However, I told the guy in advance that I would have to leave at 12:30 so I could get a decent amount of sleep; he said that was fine & he would leave with me. The night goes on and I quickly realize this is not what I had planned. The entire night he just stands right next to the bar, ordering endless amounts of shots & drinks. I didn’t think much of it at first but after about an hour of it I was getting annoyed. He quickly became incoherent and was stumbling every time he tried to walk. I tried to get him to step away from the bar and got him a cup of water but he wasn’t having it. This was the first problem. The 2nd problem was that he got insanely jealous (keep in mind, it’s our second time hanging out, and we had not discussed a relationship or anything like that). I saw an old guy friend of mine and we caught up for a few minutes. This didn’t sit well with the guy I went with, and he pulled me aside and told me to pay more attention to him. I’m not one to argue, plus I knew he was very drunk so I simply let it go. However this continued. Every time I even looked in the direction of another guy he would make a sly comment. Third problem began when he kept trying to put his arm around me, hold my hand, or pull me close about every 10 minutes. I don’t like PDA even when I’m dating someone, but I don’t even really know this guy. I explained that to him in the nicest way possible, & I had to tell him I wasn’t comfortable with that type of stuff multiple times. It was getting time for me to leave & I was more than ready to get the hell out of there and take his drunk self home. It was about 12:45 at this point and I really needed to get home; keep in mind I also had to bring him back home & the bar is about 30 minutes from where we live. He was waiting at the bar to get his last drink that he had already ordered and I kept repeating I couldn’t wait any longer and needed to get home. He said he wanted to come with me, and I asked him if he could just forget the drink (trust me, he didn’t need another) and leave since I was already staying later than I had planned. He wouldn’t budge. Every time I tried to talk to him it was just slurred words back. It was almost 1 and I was done with his bullshit. I went and found the other friend we came with and explained the situation to him and told him to take the drunk guy with him & he said he would. I told the guy that his friend was waiting for him in the back and to go find him & go home with him & then I just left. He called me as soon as I left but I couldn’t understand a word he was saying so I texted him but he called me about 30 times that night but I just stopped answering. AITA?

EDIT: the reason I feel a bit like an a hole here is because he was so drunk I don’t think he even understood that I was trying to leave him with his friend. He could’ve stumbled out in the street for all I know because I stopped answering his calls."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"TL;DR new family with a 5 year old moved in to our house, and my cat has been acting weird. I've progressively been meaner when I tell him to stop bothering her, but I'm not even 100% sure it's him that's causing her stress. AITA for blaming him and essentially telling him he's being dishonest? Am I a bad cat owner because I'm not observant of what's causing her stress? (This is the bigger concern I have)

I (23F) live at home with my family with my cat. I will be moving out with my cat in 2 weeks. I have had my cat for 1 year since she was a kitty. We have many spare rooms in our house that my mom rents out, and recently a new family moved in.

Their 5 year old loves messing around with her. Last week, I found her whole back was tacky wet, and I couldn't brush it out. My sister said she thinks she saw him pet her with wet hands another time, but she's not sure. When I took her to the vet for a checkup 3 days ago, they ended up shaving off a huge chunk of her back because of the mat and seeing her like that made me heartbroken. I told him to not touch the cat unless his hands are clean, inferring he caused it.

The other day I was petting her and he started up the Dyson towards her and I told him to stop. He said he was playing, and I explained that it's scary and she hates it.

She puked furballs and some black string 4 days ago. After catching him trying to feed her (cat) food I told him that she is portion controlled and she'll grow fat, but mainly because I'm scared of what he's feeding her when I'm not around. 

The straw that broke the camel's back was when I woke up from the sound of her meowing yesterday, and I found that he was throwing cat toys at her to try and get her to play while she was hiding in her carrier. My cat isn't a frequent nor loud meower, but it actually managed to wake me up. I didn't hold back and YELLED at him to just STOP interacting with the cat at all. He started sniffling and said ""but I wasn't"", and I accused him of lying.

She's been more on edge these days and from the previous incidents I deduced that it was likely because of him. Everytime I tell him to stop he says he's not doing anything wrong. His mom has been offering me treats and even gave me skincare, and it makes me feel bad because clearly they are trying to remedy our relationship. In the history of kids playing with cats, I'm sure this isn't the worst, AITA for just assuming a kid doing bad things to my cat? If none of his actions have been harmful and I'm just being crazy? AITA for snapping at him?

c73aim	2019-06-29 19:11:53	familialdysfunction	AITA for not telling my siblings about my dads double life?	"I’ve already sort of made a decision regarding this but I’d like some feedback on whether or not I’m handling this correctly.

My dad was physically and emotionally abusive to both me and my brother. My whole life I’ve internalized his abuse and as a result have been in therapy on and off since I was 14. My brother reacted to the abuse in a different way and has debilitating anxiety to the point where he can’t leave our familial home, allowing a cycle of retraumatization occur. The youngest sibling, our sister, never really experienced the abuse in the same way. By the time she was old enough to start to conceptualize his behavior, she had largely attributed it to his personality.

About 6 years ago, my dad was helping me move in to my new spot before grad school started when he admitted to me that he had a problem. There’s some context around this but the important part is him admitting that for years he had been doing a mixture of different drugs and was sleeping around on my mom. On one particular occasion he even got someone pregnant and I now have a half sister as a result. Suddenly all of his erratic and frankly terrifying behaviors made sense and this weird sense of relief came over me. I’m not crazy, my dad is sick and something is wrong with him. 

While this new knowledge gave me a sense of understanding and helped me compartmentalizations my experiences, I doesn’t seem safe to assume that it would do the same for my siblings. If it’s helpful to know, my mom already knows about this and they’re dealing in their own way. I especially worry about my brother, who in addition to being incredibly anxious, has serious rage issues against my dad. My dad has been taking steps to get help (going to therapy, on medication) and is attempting to have more “normal” relationships with us.

"Been together with my boyfriend for 8 years, he's rarely mentioned his father, I just know he left them when bf (now 29) was a kid. There's been no contact since. I asked bf when we first met if he was ever curious, he said no, he was happy that man was out of his life and didn't want to talk or think about him ever again. I have respected this, I have not asked questions or initiated to talk about it. I've never seen pictures of him or learned anything about his life.

I've been very curious to see what the father of my boyfriend looks like, and just generally who he is. I just recently (through a comment on a Facebook post) learned his first name, so I decided to look him up on Facebook. I saw pictures, which also revealed that he has gotten new kids in the recent years.

I deleted the browser history and planned on keeping it to myself. Some days pass, and I was going to show bf something on Facebook. When I hit the search bar, his father's name of course showed up.

Bf is very mad. It's hard for him to deal with the fact that I know things about his father's life now. That makes him curious to know what I know. He feels I didn't respect his wishes. I didn't think he'd ever find out, he says that doesn't make it any better. I think it's natural for me to be curious about the future grandfather of our children. I have respected bf's wish by not asking about him for 8 years, and had not planned on taking it any further than just finding out what he looks like.

Bf has not been the same since it happened. I understand that it's hard for him, but I don't think it's right for him to still be mad at me. My intention was always to continue to respect his wishes by never bringing up his father.

c7395u	2019-06-29 19:08:30		AITA for asking my wife(40F) not smoke her medical marijuana with her daughter(14F)	"OK, so background setup:

I have been married my wife more than 10 years. We have one child together. The daughter (we'll call her Y) in question comes from her previous marriage. That other man has FULL custody of Y and so my wife has no parental rights.  My wife smoked pot when we got married, and stopped after a few years, and things were going alright. The father of Y and his new wife were also smokers. When Y got old enough to be interested in it, the parents freely supplied both cannabis (black market, not a legal state) and cigarettes.  During that time, my wife was pretty livid about the whole thing, and berated them for being trashy parents.

FF a few years.  Now I am in one of several US states that recently passed legislation allowing the use of medical marijuana. My wife does suffer from anxiety / depression and a near crippling level of ADD. I was not opposed to her getting treatment with cannabis. She got her card and it isn't a problem for me.  However, the laws around the use of medical cannabis are very clear, and include(among many others): You cannot medicate in the presence of minors. You can't give / sell / trade any of your medicine to any other party (even other card holders).

Now of course, my wife has changed her tune about those previously 'trashy' parents. When Y comes to visit, she freely shares her medicine with Y. And Y is all too happy to come and visit WAY more often than she ever did before (wow, who would have thought?).

All this being said, I do believe that Y has inherited many of the debilitating mental conditions that my wife has. IF she was under our custody, I would likely allow her to seek treatment, and if a professional thought it was appropriate, then I would stand down. Y's father doesn't really believe that mental illness is a thing (also chem-trails, birther, anti-vax, you get it) so he would never get her professional treatment. And my wife is standing her ground on the argument ""well if she did see a doctor they would give it to her, so I'm just gonna by-pass that step"".

The irony is that when it was still illegal, then it was trashy, but now that it is medicine, its totally not trashy , its helping Y cope.

Obviously a tangled and complicated subject, but my primary concerns are the breaking law. I feel like my wife is risking too much.  She could lose her medical card. Possibly face jail time.  And even worst case scenario, get OUR child removed from our custody.  All because of the classic ""well she is going to get it anyway, she is a teenager, so its safer this way. (not that I don't completely disagree with that argument)

So AITA for continuing to mention that I don't want her to be sharing that medicine with her daughter?

I spent a lot on my middle child's clothes (about $100 or so). After we are done, my youngest child asks to go to Gamestop. I refuse, telling him I do not want to spend $60 on a worthless game he's probably going to toss away. He promises me that he will not throw it away because he is a big fan of the game and he's been playing it for years. I still refuse. He begins to go on a rant and he said something like this: 
""Well, middle child didn't need clothes either. He's already got stuff from my mom after he graduated middle school, and now he's getting even more clothes for his birthday in the upcoming days. So what the fuck is the point of buying him more clothes anyways? He's just spending your money even though my mom is already buying him loads of clothes for his birthday. You also bought him a $25 apple giftcard as an early birthday present. How come you can spend $100 on his clothes, but you can't buy me a $60 game even though you have like $1000 stuffed in your pocket."" Or something like that I'm not even sure at this point.
Even after he went on that rant, I refused because I thought he was being just a spoiled brat and  irrational.


TLDR; I take my middle child clothes shopping, younger kid comes along and wants to go to GameStop. I refused, and he went on a rant, but I still refused because I thought he was being a spoiled brat.

c737xm	2019-06-29 19:05:36	vvtroubledartist	AITA For Taking Away My(17f) Quality Skin Care Products From My Sister?(12F)	"I got a job a while ago and I can finally save up for the higher quality skin products. I've always had funky skin, and the nicer products of course work better but of course come at a higher price so my parents never really bought it unless it was for a present and stuck to more generic brands. Ever since I've been able to buy my own product, my skin has gotten way better.

I make sure I make the product last long enough until I'm able to pay for it again, and I'm very sparing. My sister asked if she could use the products as well, and although I was hesitant, I ended up agreeing and told her to be careful and sparing. She wasn't. I gave her reminders that she didn't need 2 or 3 face wipes, or a whole glob of moisturizer. She would always reply with one word annoyed answers. She kept wasting my product, so I took them out of the bathroom and now keep them in my room. She got pissed and told me that she also deserves good skin too(we have the same issues) and that I shouldn't hog it. I told her it was MY product that I spent MY money on and that she wouldn't stop wasting it after constant reminders. But then my parents took her side saying that I should share because we're sisters and that she should get to have healthy skin and that I was being petty, so I started second guessing myself and I'm worried I am being selfish but I really dont want her to waste my products anymore

Edit: Thanks for the feedback. It's a relief to know I'm not actually being a bitch. My parents have pulled things like this on me before, I would do extra chores to earn that toy I really wanted when I was little, but my sister also got to play with it and often it ended up in her room and I never got it back. A lot of you are suggesting I split the product as well, and I'm considering it but at the same time I feel like that would open to more bickering and her feeling entitled to it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c731nn	2019-06-29 18:50:24	TheLittlePillow	AITA for kicking my friend	"Hey! So first time posting here. Sorry if there are typos or parts which are a bit unclear, It is super hot in Europe today and I am really tired.

&#x200B;

So basically I have had this friend at school for a few years now. He is really nice and we get along very well. He knew this other guy from a while back who I will be calling Jack. Jack comes to the same school with my friend and, although we are in the same group of friends, we don't get along to well and probably wouldn't be friends with him he didn't know my other friends so well.

&#x200B;

Recently I bought a new pair of Sony headphones. I love them and so I took them to school to listen to music and stuff. We are all sitting in a sought of common room talking to each other and doing work. I was listening to music with the headphones, while I was doing my work. I then saw Jack sitting down laughing to himself while looking at me. Being the shy slightly over-worried person I am, I casually held onto the earcup (which turns off the noise-canceling) to hear what he was saying. He was joking to my friends (who were just trying to ignore him) about how the headphones were overpriced, bad, etc. you know, that sought of thing. Me being an idiot and slightly confrontational person, said:

""Look I get it, you're jealous."" (or something along those lines, this was about a week ago). He said:

""I thought they were supposed to be noise-canceling."" (again this was a week ago but the was the point of what he said)

So I said: ""I turned it off to hear you, you hold the ear cup. Just stop being annoying""

&#x200B;

I then returned to my music and work. A few seconds later I see him coming over to me so I look up. He proceeds to put his hands on both the ear cups and started to press hard onto them. When I say hard, I don't mean uncomfortable hard, I mean it genuinely hurt. 

&#x200B;

This is where the title comes into it. I kicked him away with my leg. I didn't kick him hard, It was more of a push into his leg so he would not be able to crush the headphones.

&#x200B;

I then told him to ""f\*ck off"" and that he was stepping out of line

He responded saying: 

""Jeez you have such anger issues, I can't wait to shoot you in the head"" ( We were going to a paintball place that weekend and although, despite him saying he did, he didn't say that he was talking about the paintball, but I got the idea) Then, he left the room.

c730fe	2019-06-29 18:47:32	throwaawayyy23499	AITA for not asking if my girlfriend could come to a friend’s wedding with me?	"This happened a couple years ago and I’ve had mixed answers on it, so I figured I’d make a post to get the opinions of the true asshole judges. 

So I (23 at the time) was invited to wedding of a friend that I have known since 3rd grade. We hadn’t talked much or seen each other but a few times since high school as she was living out of state, but it’s the type of friendship where that is ok. Her mom and and my mom are also friends as our little brothers are the same age and played sports together. 

Our entire family was invited to her wedding. My sisters boyfriend was not, neither was my brothers girlfriend who was the same age (and went to the same school) as the brides brother. 

I knew my mom has told me they were a little tight budget wise and it wasn’t gonna be a huge wedding, but it wasn’t small either. Good friends and family of each, no randoms. 

So my girlfriend at the time, who we had been on and off (she was bipolar and just emotionally unstable) for almost two years at that point, (who the bride has also never met) asks if she was invited. I said no, it was just our family and that neither my sisters boyfriend or brothers gf was invited either. She said “well she’s your friend, you can ask her if I can come”. I told her that I did not feel comfortable asking a question like that knowing they were a bit tight budget wise. Also, I didn’t want to make them feel obligated either. It’s her day. 

She gets super angry, says I’m putting my friend above her. Her mom also felt like I should has asked as well and a couple other people who I’ve told felt like while they see my side, I could have asked when we got the invitation. I just said I simply do not feel comfortable asking a question like that about a wedding that has been set. She had never met my then girlfriend and it just didn’t seem like an appropriate thing to do. To make things better, my brother got sick the night before the wedding and couldn’t go. My gf got mad I didn’t ask the bride, on her wedding day, if she could take my brothers place.

c72xcb	2019-06-29 18:40:04	Throwaway67654565432	AITA Apologies and non apologies.	"I am person B. 

A holds a strongly defended view that sorry is only allowed to be used in an apology, and saying things like ""I am sorry you're upset"" are regarded as a non apology and harm causing. Saying it is an indulgence for the speaker, not the listener.

B recognises this, but believes that saying ""I am sorry you're upset"" isn't offered as an apology, but a reflection on how B feels about how A is expressing themselves.

Both A and B agree that apologies are needed around the upset and hurt, and saying ""I am sorry you're upset"" doesn't remove or in anyway satiate that need.

B no longer uses that phrase, recognising the harm felt by A. As a result, language used can be unnatural as they change how they address their need to express their feelings to A.

A and B have an argument about a discussion on an article. After the fact (some days later) A described the argument as ""when you would not allow me to just say the article had a different point to the one you had given"". B described that aspect at the time as ""I wasnt disagreeing with the conclusion or point of the article. I was talking about something different, a new idea, that I felt you were telling me could not be correct because that's not what the article said.""

Apology from B: ""I accept and acknowledge that you felt condenseded / diminished and that you felt I had not heard your argument. I am sorry that I was not able to present my argument in a way that did not result in you feeling negatively impacted. I am trying not to do that, I didn't notice it happening until it was too late, and I had upset you. I am sad that you feel bad and not heard by me. I am sorry that I wasn't able to let you feel heard.""

Observation from A

I still feel like you're apologising because you ""could not pander to my specific needs of feeling heard"" which i just don't agree with

Clarification example from B. This is out of sequence of the actual conversation, but was the best example of Bs attempts to justify the last sentence of the apology.

""And I have tried, repeatedly, to clarify what I meant by that. Which is, I am sorry that I was not able to give you the space to allow your arguments to be heard by me.""

Reply from A in summary after 3 hours to-ing and fro-ing.

""Yes i think your apology is a non apology. Yes i accept that you didn't intend to hurt me by phrasing it that way. You might be trying. But your initial apology doesn't imply you actually see anything wrong with what happened. Or that you have anything to actually apologise for Mostly you seem to be apologising for my reaction to things you did.""

A encouraged B to ask reddit 

A ""I honestly think that any other person would read that apology in the exact same way i did.This whole conversation you've been doing what you've done a number of times which is to suggest that I'm wrong/precious for taking it the way i have."" 

B ""I honestly don't.""

c72x8c	2019-06-29 18:39:49		AITA for fucking a girl outside and then declining to walk her home?	So basically that’s the whole story, but I’ll give a little more detail. She and I are somewhat friends and have been with each other sexually once before. One day I was feeling a little horny so I hit her up like seeing if she wanted to chill or whatever. One thing leads to the next and next thing you know I’m in her guts by a river. So I get my nut off and live literally like 2 minutes from this river( she probably live like 10 mins walking) so I chill with her by the river for like another good 30 and prepare to walk home. We are about to go our separate ways and then she asks can I walk her home. Normally I would not have a problem with that, but I had just put in work for like a hour and I was wiped. So I respectfully declined and walked away without looking back. I think she’s pissed lol.		1	0

c72wrc	2019-06-29 18:38:38	ERommel45	AITA for not willing to give up my seat on the Metro	"The metro (train system) from where I live classifies seats into Priority (handicap/pregnant/elderly) and non-Priority. If chance permits, I'll usually take the non-Priority seats for my daily commute. The high volume of passengers however is often a cause for concern in a densely populated region like mine so undoubtedly, seats would be in short supply even to the needy at times.

It was another regular day for me as I was travelling via the metro and a middle-aged lady who was standing singled me out and requested I offered my seat to another elderly nearby. Admittedly, I wasn't paying attention then but I would've incline to offer should said elderly actually requested for it anyway. I would also have done so voluntarily should I deem it necessary although not at anyone else's behest.

Yet I believe the lady who called me out was in no position to do so, more so when it's on someone else's behalf. Obviously this puts me in an awkward position as I felt unnecessarily pressured to yield with all eyes on me given the commotion. I was also sitting amongst fellow young adults, so god knows why she picked me of all people. What's worse was the elderly in question declined the offer before I could even stand up as he was alighting at the following stop.

This incident isn't the first that I'm experiencing and quite frankly, as a fellow commuter who paid his fair share for the ride, I'm exhausted at not only being subjected to social pressure like these but the constant ambivalence I have to exercise on occasions when I do manage to sit.

Reactions to the incident are rather mixed however: A few in my defense that I need not conform to such coercion with the other camp suggesting that I shouldn't be upset, some going so far as to argue that ""all seats are reserved seats"" in a tightly spaced environment.

so I'd like to canvass some opinions here: **Am I the asshole for reserving the right to give up my seat in public?**"	Everyone Sucks	0	0
c72wpz	2019-06-29 18:38:34	brokenfuton	AITA for snapping at my Grandma?	"Okay, so a bit of info first. 

My family is extremely conservative. I am very liberal, but I am polite and do my best to put up with their political discussions as I am living in their house. My grandma is very nosy but usually nice. No one is allowed to be mean to my grandmother under any circumstances or else they get hit.

Onto today’s events. 

My grandma had to go to a doctor’s appointment, and my mother took her. They came back and picked up the rest of the family to go to lunch. On the way there, my grandma started talking about this girl in the waiting room. 

G’ma: “A girl and her mother were at the clinic today, I overheard the nurse that they were waiting for an ultrasound. She was so young, how shameful, and her ‘Baby Daddy’ wasn’t with her! No ring on her finger either! ...etc.”

She kept saying things like this, tsking and all that with my mom, and I finally snapped at her. 

Me: “You have no idea why she was there! She could be looking for a cyst or a tumor or something, why are you being so judgmental? What business is it of yours?”

I got scolded and they haven’t talked to me for the past few hours. I don’t like raising my voice, especially at my grandma, but she was literally bad-mouthing some teen girl she never met! I also think I snapped because I hear her say things like that about me, regarding things she doesn’t know all the facts about, so I just had enough.

c72w9y	2019-06-29 18:37:34	EvenTackle	WIBTA if I got a bank account without telling my mom	"So I am an 18 year old male who is attending a college out of state next year, far from home. I got a joint checking account with my mom when I was sixteen. She can see any purchases in it, how much money I have, transfer any money, etc. I talked to her recently about opening up another new account, under my name, and using the joint account as a sort of savings (I’m currently using it to save money for college). She got very upset at the idea that I would want my own private account. She doesn’t understand why I would want to keep my purchases personal, why I would hide anything from her. Keep in mind I don’t plan on really hiding anything, I just don’t really like my mom knowing all my personal financial details, and I might buy something she might not approve of in future, or link it to a credit card (she believes credit cards are the devil and would be horrified if she knew I was trying to build credit). So, WIBTA if I opened a new account without telling her when I get to college? Keep in mind she does support me pretty well financially, not paying for everything, but certainly paying for a lot. I don’t think it’s that big a deal to want a little privacy in my financial life, even though I am pretty dependent on her. I understand that she wants to make sure I’m caring for myself financially, but I think a little independence is no big deal.

Last night at my work (restaurant) we have a terrace fenced up in case of people trying to dine and dash (we had some on our 1st year of being open). My work is located in downtown Montreal where there's festivals during the summer season.

Jazz fest brings out plenty of people from all over the world. Last night one of my waitress run up to me saying how these two people reached out and just took one of the chairs. The owner hears this and we run out to find them, he runs out on the right I went left and as fate would have it I find them the next corner up. It was a middle age man and with I'm assuming is his father.

I went up to them and ask them: ""I'm sorry but you guys cant just decide to take our chair, there are sitting areas for this and other establishments."" Theres a Starbucks and dairy queen right where they were! They decide to randomly take ours?

This person was trying to throw money at me and asking me to think about my own grandparents and on how they were gonna bring it back eventually. I said sorry but you cant just decide to take people's stuff. Honestly maybe if they asked before hand we would had just let them sit on our terrace without even ordering anything.

This old man I felt bad he had a cane and all so I  helped him up and just took the chair back, all I'm hearing from the other man, as I was walking back was how I'm a despicable human being and that I'm not a good person.

c72mfl	2019-06-29 18:14:17	Hfsitsjess	WIBTA if I confined my cat to the living room at night?	I have a four year old cat that I adopted from his owner who moved abroad about a year ago. Overall, he’s a great cat, but, at 4:30am every morning he gets into a scratching routine. He’ll sleep with me all night and then start scratching at things in my room, I think because he wants attention. If I shoo him away, he starts scratching on my roommates’ door. I catch him most of the time before he wakes one of them up, but, not always. I’ve tried training him with a squirt bottle and while he’s sort of scared by it, it hasn’t worked as long term deterrent. He just goes “Oh shit!”, runs away for a few minutes and goes back at it. I also bought anti-scratch spray to put on the things he likes to scratch and the doors of my roommates’, but again it doesn’t seem to deter him. I make sure he has enough food and water before I go to bed, his litter is clean and he has toys out to play with, including two scratching posts that he likes and uses. The only way I’ve found to get him to stop scratching is to basically go downstairs and lay on the couch. (I have no idea why this works but it does.) I always check his food and such when I go downstairs with him and it’s always pretty full. I figured out I could confine him to the living room at night; I can put his food and water in there for him, his toys are there and it wouldn’t impede his access to the litter box. I love my cat and I feel terrible that he wouldn’t be able to snuggle me at night and worry that he would get lonely. That said, I need to sleep past 4:30am and so do my roommates, who understandably are upset at him and me if they get woken up.	Not the A-hole	0	0

Because of this, my family decided to go to Philippines for vacation. Anyway, my mom's family is huge over there, she has 10 siblings, each with their own families and families. 

Because of this, rooms are limited, and the room I slept in had 8 people. This was the only room with AC.

Ok, so one night I was sleeping next to my dad since beds are limited. I didn't really care because we sometimes share beds if we go to a hotel or something. But this time, I hear a shuffling that lasts for quite awhile.and I look over, I can see in the moonlight through the window that he's stroking his dick. This made me so disgusted, but I couldn't move because I didn't want him to see me awake. Anyway, after he started grunting softly and moaning and finished.... He got up and went to the bathroom. This happened about 5 times over the vaca. 

Should I tell my family how disgusting it is. I wouldn't care if he went to the bathroom and did his business. But in a room full of family? It makes me feel so disgusted."		1	0

Many years ago I met this great guy (Bob) who was popular at my store. We maintained a close relationship for a few years and then he moved to AZ looking to be promoted. Even after he moved we maintained somewhat a long distance relationship for a while. However as all good things do it ended just because we both had very busy lives. My closest friend (Jane) also had his number. And would tell me that they were talking and that she really liked him knowing that I had a relationship with him. But I guess I kinda forgot about the relationship for a while. 
Skip to this year. 
Bob apparently came back to town 2 months ago. But, I wasnt aware he was back here. So Jane has been talking about how she is hanging out with this guy and blah blah blah. Romanticized crap. Sometime later, I go to the store and I see him. I could literally feel my heart beating out of my chest. He sees me and he smiles and walks over and we start talking about everything. He said something along the lines of, ""as nice as it would be to catch up I have to go heres my number. Let's meet up tomorrow."" 
I met up with him and he is still as great as I remember him. We talked about our lives and what's been happening and I feel just like I did forever ago. He texted me as well that he still feels the same as I do. 
Jane and Bob are not exclusive. But he's been hanging out with her. And they kinda have been talking for a while. I dont want to ruin my relationship with Jane if I go for it, but I think I love this man. So reddit, AITA if I act on my feelings for Bob?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I refused to approve the release of the funds, she wrote me a nasty email, after which I responded pointing out things like ""The PTA funds are not her personal wallet"" and that ""she hasn't followed due process, and the quid pro quo/bartering community funds for a job at the school are unacceptable"". I hate bullshit, I decided to volunteer for the PTA because I work in fundraising and they needed help. I busted my ass getting sponsorships for school events on the premise of helping students in need, not fucking cafeteria furniture.

My buddy's mom thought it was unfair for little brother to not be able to play with the computer but my buddy was a total pushover and didn't know how to tell his mom that those were expensive parts and a kid should not be messing with them. Fast forward a year and my buddy builds a computer. Not a good one, but could play games like CSgo. Little brother already had a tablet and a laptop and my friend had a tablet and the computer HE paid for. My friends mom made him split the PC half and half, where my friend would get screwed over. Little brother broke his tablet to get more PC time and then used my friends and called my friends tablet his own. I have many more details on how entitled but I should get to the point. My friend made a bomb ass PC like $1000+ but little brother payed $200 of it and got it half and half and my friend still had to fix it when it broke. At this point I hated his little brother and when my friends dad gave the little brother my friends PC and gave my friend $700 to build a new one little brother started playing fortnite. My friend plays siege with me but he isn't too good so his stats are sometimes made fun of and when his little brother heard he constantly made fun of him and that's when I found fortnite tracker I was soooooo excited. I told my buddy to put me on speaker and I absolutely went off. He has 580 games and 1 win yet he calls my friend bad. My other friend was getting mad at me because ""hes just a 10 year old"".

We were best friends for years before deciding to be a couple and things are going great. We have talked about being open to polyamory since the beginning and recently (two weeks ago) added another close friend into the relationship.

Things are going great right now, I'm just finding myself in a situation in which I feel like an asshole. The new person in our relationship has been asked out by a guy at work and she immediately came to us and asked how we felt about it. She won't make any steps without making sure we are okay with it and is 100% willing to turn him down if needed. We have an agreement that if even one of us doesn't like a decision in the relationship we will talk it over.

The thing is, she seems really into this guy and I can tell she wants to date him. I told her I'm not comfortable this early in with being in an open relationship due to past issues with it. 

I feel like a complete asshole. I feel like I'm trying to control her by putting my issues first. AITA?

Edit: I've been getting mixed answers, but it seems for the most part this is a NAH situation. I'm going to tell her that she can and should go out with him if she wants to. My issues with confidence should not affect how my partners live their lives."	No A-holes here	0	0

c72i1n	2019-06-29 18:04:16	124inches	UPDATE AITA for being angry at my sister for taking my kids to a Catholic Mass?	"[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c47s85/aita_for_being_angry_at_my_sister_for_taking_my/)

So as the thread went, I felt like shit. I tried calling my sister but she didn't respond (Almost certainly intentionally.) I texted her begging her to respond. I even started crying myself once I noticed she defriended me on Facebook.

After about a day, she sent me a brief text back saying to call her. I did. I apologized for the way I acted and my threats. She told me that she was certain that I wasn't going to actually follow up on that threat to cut her off from my kids for life, because I tend to make outlandish threats like that and have my whole life, but even hearing it hurt her deeply. She told me how much she loves my kids, how much fun they had together that weekend, and that she'd can't imagine being cut out of their lives.

I explained to her why I won't attend a Catholic Mass or allow my kids at one, and how my semi-raising of my kids in a different church is very different. She admitted that having thought about it she should've asked me ahead of time and not merely assumed that it was OK and basically the same thing, but also assured me she had never heard anything anti-LGBT at that church and if she ever did she would walk right out that service. She also told me that as hurt as she was she did consider if retaining a connection to an anti-LGBT church was right and that she didn't have to go to that one just because she was brought up in it to have a relationship with God. It was something she contemplated even as much resentment she had for me after that because in the end she still loved me. After that I was unable to talk because the tears were so strong. She also mentioned that our parents had talked to her that week, and she told them how much hurt she had over this. My parents told her that they know first hand how anti-Catholic I am and how much of a big deal this is to me, but that they wouldn't expect a reaction on that level yet also assured her my threats probably weren't sincere. They know me!

So the agreements we reached is she won't take the kids to Mass ever again, and that we won't speak of the incident anymore and forgive and move on. And that she would even consider seeking a different church. And then when the call ended I got a notification less than a minute later she accepted my Facebook friend request.

I then discussed making it up to her especially as I didn't pay her, and she said she'd just like for us all to meet up and have a fun day together with her, the kids and I the weekend after the 4th. So that's what we'll do!

I called my parents later and let them know that I think I mended it. They told me that that's always how I've been, although rarely that harsh, I don't recall being that nasty to her even as a teen. Regardless they're happy it's all mended now. All is well!"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

Alright, strange question I know. TL;DR at bottom

So on a self-post weekend thread from about 3-4 weeks ago (where tf is that thread this weekend anyway?) I saw someone with similar interests, and we got talking(not in a dating way or anything DW, I was interested in the books she was writing) - her 15 and me turning 14 on Thursday. She mentioned summer plans, and I said nothing, and she mentioned she was hosting an event. I did some research on this event and on the event's website, there was a link to the IG of the event, which I clicked on. The bio read 'Yo I'm Z', which is important for later

&#x200B;

Now today I know that the event is happening, and she told me yesterday she was ready, so I decided to check how the event was going. I don't find much, cause the event account is private, but what I do find is a news interview with someone hosting it - captioned with something along the lines of *her state (and city, which I didn't know yet and wasn't gonna ask about)* will be changed by a 15 year old girl this Saturday.

&#x200B;

Of course I watch the video, cause why not, and it comes up with a name. I won't share, but the first name began with Z. My dumb ass decides to put this name into Google, and it's pretty unique. The front page has her books, her personal (and private) IG, and an athletics record containing her school FFS. 

&#x200B;

Now I feel like a creep, cause I didn't stop when I should have and I don't know how to tell her what I did. The event will be on for another couple hours, so i'm not too bothered about this post being found.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Person I was talking to mentioned an event, did research and came up with their first initial, then watched an interview cause why not and came up with a name, decided to put the name into Google and came up with their school.

I had a very needy friend, Natalie.  Natalie has a problem respecting boundaries.

She wanted to come over.  I said no, have plans.  I wake up to Natalie here.  She called my husband asking if could come.  He told her was working on the truck, if she wanted to come over and go w/him to take the truck on a test drive, feel free.   

I tell her, 'I told you yesterday, we have plans, you need to leave.'  She didn't take it well.  It's rare that he and I get time together, especially alone (kids in school or something). 

Later, get a text from her, she senses there's been a ""seismic change in our relationship, on both sides"" (over truck ride) and that she is ""so very hurt and humiliated"" over the ""pity truck ride.""

I've had an enormous amount on my plate.  It started with my adult nephew murdering someone.

Our good friend wain ICU.  3 weeks on life support, late night call, his GF asking if I would come stay w/ her when they removed life support let him pass.  

Natalie treated my friend's stay in the ICU as not important, did ask how he was doing a couple times.  Try to tell her, she would say that wasn't possible, because 10+ years ago was done xyz.

A GoFundMe was set up for my friend and his GF, she said that's stupid.  

Because my brother in law was an addict, him being missing was also not a big deal, to Natalie. 

Friend passed around 3am.  Around 10am, Natalie shows up.  I tell her bad time, friend just passed.  She sits, says that her friend just died too.  Odd.  But ok, I try to be a good friend to her. 

I raised my sister from birth, Natalie knows this, so of course my sister comes before Natalie to me.  

Natalie's upset we're grieving for 7 hours. Says I'm not there for her, relationships have 2 people, and she has needs.  I tell her I'm doing my best, I cannot handle more than I am. I have to put my oxygen mask on before can help anyone.  As someone who's a therapist, you would think she would be understanding of this, but no.  

She says I'm putting everyone else before her. Well, I am, their situations are life/death.  She has ton of friends and close w/her family.  I'm not her only friend/source of support.  

I finally gave up and told my husband, ""I can't deal with this shit right now, good luck,"" went inside.  Stayed until husband had to go back to work.  I desperately wanted to tell her to GTFO, but she seems to thrive on drama, I felt like doing that would give her what she wanted. Always the victim.  

BIL was found after 6 weeks, dead.  Cops say murder. I shared way we chose to celebrate his life, Natalie posted an obituary asking for prayers.  This is very common thing w/her.  Her life mirroring mine.  She's commented on it.  Could be coincidence, but I'm skeptical now. 

She has done this before.  Person she did it to before me is literally moving states away, to get away from the shit Natalie caused for her and her kids.

So I go to pick her up. She doesn't look like her photos, looks at least 35. We exchange greetings and talk a bit on the way to a cafe.

We get out of the car and the first thing she says ""Well you are so shorter than me"", I smile and shrug it off. It's true that I'm short but I had already put that on my Tinder profile, moreover she's only a couple inches taller. Anyways we walk to a cafe and she notices a shop and wants to stop there. She goes ""Just go ahead and wait me at the cafe"" which I have no problem with. 

She arrives 20 min later. The cafe is self-serve, she wants orange juice. I go to order, they have no juice, no cold drinks etc. so I go back to our table and tell her we can just try somewhere else.

She suggest somewhere and we go there but there's a birthday party there so they refuse to service us. She again spots a shop and wants me to wait for her but before I can answer she changes her mind, I think she noticed the look on my face. We get in the car and decide to drive until we spot a cafe. We get there and unfortunately it's closed. There's a park nearby though.

I offer to hit up another place but she's frustrated and there's a supermarket nearby so she tells me to buy some waterand cherries. I offer to buy whatever and eat at the park. But she laughs, rolls her eyes and goes ""Are you serious, come on?"". So like the good idiot I am, I walk to the supermarket.

So she waits by the car and I go to buy water and cherries. She calls me and tells me to buy watermelons too. I find it odd but I felt bad for her so I say ok. She calls me again and this time she tells me to buy eggs and cheese, too. And I'm too much of a coward to refuse and I feel bad for her like an asshole since she's disabled.

At this point I feel like an idiot, So I call a friend and tell him to call me in two minutes.

I pay and get to her, she's complaining about how she forgot her sunscreen and her skin burns.  My phone rings as expected and I pick up, talk a bit and close. So we get in the car and I say ""How about I drop you off at your house?"" and she gladly accepts. I didn't even have to lie about the call. I drive her over and she thanks me for the groceries and tells me not to get out since she can take them. I offer to help her carry but she refuses.

I feel like such a doormat. I felt pity for her since she's disabled and I also feel like an asshole since I'm pitying a disabled person. At no point I thought buying groceries would get me some action with her because to be honest she wasn't attractive at all. But still I did everything she told me like a doormat.

So, growing up my mother was extremely abusive both mentally and physically. We lived in a small village though and my grandparents were rich so nothing was done to help me. As soon as I turned eighteen I packed my things, wrote my mother a letter saying I never wanted to speak to her again and left for the other side of the country.

&#x200B;

That was all thirteen years ago. Almost a year ago I started dating my now ex-boyfriend. He was really nice, but at times arrogant. He is smart, no doubt about it, but he does seem to think he's the world's best problem solver and advisor. We all have flaws though, I sure do as well, so I figured this was his flaw.

&#x200B;

In early May I got a letter from my mother. She desperately needed my help, she had no more money left after my grandparents' deaths and what was she supposed to do? I ignored her since she's dead to me, and dead people can't speak.

&#x200B;

A week or so after that I go away with my girlfriends on a trip. When I get home I my ex invites me over to his house for dinner and when I get there he opens the door, says ""don't be mad"" and behind him I see my mother smirking at me. I immediately walk out with him running after me explaining that she contacted him, wanting him to help mediate. So I ask him how she could contact him when there is no information about me online aside from my professional one? Turns out that he contacted her instead, wanting to hear her side.  He was seen my scars, he has seen my nightmares, and he wants to know her side?? Oh but poor him, he just wanted to understand why I was so hesitant to move forward with him.

&#x200B;

So I tell him we're over and drive home. Over the next few days he calls over and over, so I block him and then he calls my friends. After a police threat the calls end.

About two weeks ago his father calls me and tells me that I need to come and get my mother. That it's been four weeks and she refuses to move out and that I can't just leave her there after I broke up with ex. After I tell him the real story he apologizes, says he heard a different version and that he will contact the authorities instead. After this I still get the messages from ex's friends (who he apparently thought it was ok to give my phone number to) telling me I did a really shitty thing to my ex just dumping my mom on him, that I was selfish, etc. I told them what happened and some apologized but others still insisted I was in the wrong. I just gave up this week and got a new phone number and email. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So I am wondering, am I the asshole here? Is she really my responsibility to handle? My friends say it's no my fault, but then again they are my friends you know? I also know my so called normal meter isn't always working so was I the asshole in any way here? I'd rather know so I know what to change for the future."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I have made it very clear how I feel about him and that she should just leave him. She’s starting to sound like a broken record at this point. 

He can’t seem to let go of a few minor things she did at the beginning of the relationship and they are nothing compared to what he has done to her. I’m worried that he will get physically abusive with her because things just keep escalating and he is already very mentally abusive and he has started to break things when he gets mad at her. The other day his mother had to intervene and “rescue” her. The relationship is very toxic but she just keeps telling me that “she loves him and doesn’t want to give up on him yet and that things will get better” even though they have been like this for MONTHS. She even openly admits that she should leave him because the relationship is not good for her but yet she does not take my advice or anyone else’s. No one in her life likes this guy.

c7285u	2019-06-29 17:41:26		AITA for my stuff getting damaged?	"I'm on mobile, so excuse formatting and all that :\.

So, I went camping this week with my grandmother and her sister. I'm not a big fan of camping in general, so I brought my IPad so I could play some games and hook it up to the TV to watch movies at night. 

Now, along with my IPad, I brought my Apple Pencil. I bought it with my own money, unlike my IPad, which was a gift for my 14th birthday. I've had this IPad for 3+ years. I've always taken great care of it. Never dropped it, cleaned it, bought cases and screen protectors for it, etc. 

Anyway, I had to go home one night because I had class and a bunch of appointments the next day. While I was packing up, I made sure my apple pencil was with my IPad. I left the IPad on the table because I figured, ""I'm not gonna use this at home, so why bring it?""

I did all my crap the next day. I went back to the campground and walked my aunts dogs. All was good, right?

Everything was good until I went to grab my IPad and my pencil was missing. I tore apart that heckin camper looking for it! I didn't find it. My aunt was showering at the time, but as soon as she came back I asked her to look in her stuff. It wasn't in there according to her. She went on to say, ""knowing you, you probably didn't even look."" (A bit petty, yeah, but that upset me a lot. I'm a straight A student who graduated a year early from school,  always on time, always neat, I do try my best to be responsible)

Then, later that night, I was playing on my IPad while they were watching dateline and I noticed a crack. I, of course, said something about it. My aunt called me, ""batshit crazy,"" and dismissed it while my grandmother told me I should've been more responsible with it. 

I wouldn't be so mother-hecking upset if I wouldn't have gotten yelled at for it. I left my stuff on the fucking table so it wouldn't get knocked off! If they needed to use the table, they could've moved it! I'm damm well sure it was my aunt's dogs that pushed it off or something. She called me ""batshit crazy"" when I suggested that. I probably wouldn't be so angry if she admitted to it either! 

I know I should've put it in a cupboard or something, but I didn't think of that. I've gone camping and on multiple trips with that pencil and IPad and it's always been fine if I left it on the table!

My aunt has spent this entire trip complaining and insulting me. I'm very mad and upset right now because of it, so I wanna know if you guys think it was my fault or not."		1	0

c7262v	2019-06-29 17:36:37	UnattractiveUnicorn	AITA for being angry about the quality of a free car?	"Backstory: my husband and I had two crappy cars. My cousin died and my aunt gave us her car, so we traded our two crappy cars in for a decent car. Then my aunt dropped the ball into a sewer of acid and the plates expired. For a ton of reasons I am not going to get into here and do not want commented on, the car is still illegal to drive a year later. Since my brother had a series of grand mal seizures and couldn’t drive for six months, he let me borrow his vehicle until the other one got legal. Well, his six months are up and he wants his vehicle back, but the other one is still not legal. So husband is talking to his dad and mentions all the craziness. Father in law has four vehicles at his home - he thinks the multiple vehicles in the driveway prevent burglars. He is on his own, so only one at a time is being driven. He has a truck, an SUV, a sports car, and a 1998 Mystique with no AC, transmission is shooting craps, windows roll down but not back up, etc. So he decides, to my knowledge, to let us borrow the Mystique until we get life figured out. 

Here’s where I am being told I’m the asshole. I have two special needs kids I will be driving around in this car - probably not good, in my opinion, to be driving in a car we know is about to break down and put me on the side of the road with two kids who don’t comprehend danger and have impulse control issues. He was nice to offer us a loaner, and is not under any obligation to offer us anything or offer us one of his safe, working vehicles, but seriously? THIS is how you “help”?

So to make it worse, I come home and find out from my husband that we are not borrowing the car, he is giving it to us. But he dropped the insurance weeks ago without telling us it wasn’t covered (no biggie, I can take care of that), he’s also taking the plates, so it went from “here’s a car you can borrow, it doesn’t really work though” to “here’s a car that doesn’t work that you have to pay to get insured, inspected, titled, and plates on”. My point is, why the fuck would I sink money we barely have into a car we are just waiting to die? Hubby’s saying I’m being an asshole about a free car. I told my brother what’s going on and he thinks father in law is an asshole and told me to keep driving his vehicle as he’s not employed and has no kids so he doesn’t really need need it just wants it.

TLDR: FIL gave us a free car to borrow then decided we own it now and have to sink hundreds of dollars into a car with multiple mechanical issues. AITA for giving it back?"	Asshole	0	0
c725xp	2019-06-29 17:36:18	TotallyAnonPerson	AITA for trying to “secularize” my siblings?	"I’m a 16 year old with two generally supportive parents. However, I never had a disagreement with them as big as this one. 

I went to public school since when I was in 1st grade because we couldn’t afford private school at the time and I definitely wasn’t the brightest kid. 

My 11 year old sister is not the most academically bright. She doesn’t have the self-discipline to work for good grades. So when she started getting bad grades in public school when she was 8, she transferred to a way easier religious private school. She did a lot better in school since then. However, when I see her homework and her general education, she doesn’t learn as much as I did when I was her age. She only recently learned how to round to the nearest decimal place and didn’t know how to multiply until 6th grade. Her English was constantly sloppy, even for a 6th grader. Her best subjects are Hebrew, because we speak it at home, and religious studies. And she has decent grades in all her subjects, (B-s — As). Her social life is generally healthy. 

My brother, age 6, joined the religious private school that my sister went too. He’s also doing fairly well and he’s bright for a six year old. 

However, both of them are being brainwashed into orthodox Judaism. Even though we are a secular family. As an atheist, I can’t stand my siblings being brainwashed into believing in something that ultimately leaves them ignorant and gullible. I’m trying to have talks with my siblings about god and try to persuade them why god isn’t real and why Judaism is relatively useless. But they either get mad, ignore me, or demonize me. 

When I confront my mom on this, she never gives me an answer and tries to desperately change the subject. 

My mom admitted to me a few times that she, herself, doesn’t believe in God. So why is she sending them to a clearly indoctrinating school? 

I am very sure that my brother is telling his teachers about my talks about god with him. He responds with “everyone believes in god” or “if you don’t believe in god, you’re bad”. This is very concerning.

Anyway, should I continue to try to secularize them. Should I try harder? What should be my game plan? And most importantly, AITA?

TL;DR, My siblings are being indoctrinated at a dysfunctional religious school and I keep trying to secularize them to no avail. 

Sorry for the bad writing, wrote this quickly.

EDIT: changed “Judaism is useless” to “Judaism is relatively useless”.

UPDATE: After considering what the internet is telling me to do and considering my own fears and beliefs. I have decided to stop trying to secularize my siblings. They’re likely too young to comprehend the reality of non-theism(after being religiously Jewish) and they’re currently relatively happy. I figured it’s not like we live in an area where it’s necessarily an echo-chamber of Jewish rhetoric, so one day, they’ll have to question their beliefs. And I’ll be right there to guide them.

"So basically I have this place I go to for a majority of my lunch breaks. Normally I am a good tipper in the 20% range.

But I have a friend where he serves at this particular place and often during the lunch hour, I would get seated in his section. After my lunch, I would tip closer between 10 and 15%. He never makes a scene or talk about it when we hang out but sometimes I suspects he is just bottling it inside and doesn't want me to know about it.

When my friend isn't a server, he works full time in his own business with his wife. And they make good money too. Like good money where he doesn't have to serve part time.

The only reason he still serves part time is because he likes to keep busy and that he likes it when customer gave cash tips so he doesn't have to ""report"" it versus a credit card tip. And plus he used to be a server at this particular place when we were in college together.

I have a co-worker who seems to lose these things 2-3 times a week and he will come to me and ask if I have extra pen/marker. Here's the thing, I do. I always keep ONE extra pen or marker on hand just in case one dries up or falls and gets lost, or whatever. I like to always have a backup, but every time he asks, I tell him no because if I gave him my backup, I wouldn't have a backup if something happened. 

The reason I'm conflicted is because:

A) It's really not that hard to put them in a safe pocket or something and not lose them every couple days.

B) I'm not sure why he isn't just carrying an extra in a safe pocket.

On the other hand

A) Getting replacements is a mild inconvenience. They are provided to us for free, but we have to stop working and go to the office to get them, which can take time away from our work, so I understand why he is asking around instead of grabbing a new one.

B) Since they are provided to us it isn't really technically my marker or pen, it's the companies. So maybe I should just give him the pen/marker and grab another backup at the end of the day.

But I am always so cautious that if I did that, that'd be the day MY pen/marker died and I'd be left in the same situation even though I actually bothered to grab a backup. 

I will genuinely accept any verdict and will start giving him my backups of it is decided that IATA.

c71xwi	2019-06-29 17:17:28	throwaway999834721	WIBTA for sitting outside my college knowing my ex might see me?	"Obligatory mobile

Long story short I met this guy at my college and we had a very fast moving and emotional relationship for a month. After that month we broke up and tried to be friends but couldn’t stop flirting so we went silent... until he messaged me in a class we had and we went out to eat. Talk for a few weeks, silent. No talking till the last day of class where we sat next to eachother and he helped me through an anxiety attack during which I basically begged to start talking again. Then a few weeks later started hooking up... and then he went mia for a few days saying he was busy.

During that week I learned 2 things. The first was that I had had a miscarriage. The second was that I was wanting to take a few months of space then ask to start dating again but much slower. I waited to tell him both because I had no clue what he was busy with... then I got a LONG message that boils down to “this is hurting both of us. I’m cutting of all contact for good. You will always be in my heart. Keep working to get better” then he removed me on everything and I didn’t even get to say good bye.

So today a crazy realization happened. I remembered he has class the same day I would likely be hanging out on campus... my favorite spot to sit is right out front the building his class would be (no one smokes there, it has a lovely shade tree and 2 in range pokestops) with that realization I’m scared my goal for sitting there would change from relaxing to seeing him walk into the building and hoping he sees me and maybe talks to me. He was the one who would break silences and communication boundaries before... 

My friends say the best way to get him back would be to respect his desire to stop talking and let him come back to me on his own. That he would be happy I did it and it will make him like me even more. I don’t want to risk ruining my chances but I also don’t want to give up my spot on my only day to logically be up there.

Would I be an ass to still sit there that day knowing he might see me? I’ve got a few months to decide but I want to ask now.

EDIT: I realized I should probably mention the initial break up (6 months ago) was with the intent of bettering ourselves and then getting back together. Neither of us bettered ourselves... but I’m *finally* starting therapy on Tuesday!

I wanted to post this because my thoughts were “that’s my spot and always has been and if he doesn’t like it he can find another entrance” but I wanted to know the social standards here. Thinking in advance definitely gives me time to find a new spot!

c71xje	2019-06-29 17:16:37	dontwastemytime033	AITA for not supporting my daughter's career choice?	"My daughter Rachel has just finished her A Levels. She studied Maths, Economics and History. We are waiting on results but we are all confident, since her mock exam grades were excellent, as were her GCSE results two years ago. She has applied to several universities, including one of the best in the UK, and with her grades she stands a strong chance of getting in. 

Rachel had been talking about getting a summer job or something for before uni starts and went for an interview a few weeks back. She didn't tell us what it was for until she started last Monday, at which point she said the job was for an apprentice accountant. We were a bit surprised since we weren't sure why she'd start an apprenticeship when uni starts fairly soon. She claimed that it's just in case she doesn't get the grades needed for uni, but considering that she has already done so in her mock exams this isn't a serious concern. 

Rachel has now said that she is really enjoying this job and that she may consider staying even if she does get into uni. I was completely baffled by this and so was her father. I did some googling and it turns out that the apprenticeship she has chosen doesn't even require A Levels just GCSE's, and it only needs passing grades in English and Maths rather than the exceptional results Rachel got in both those subjects and others. This means that the past two years were completely pointless. 

I don't understand her choice. She has a good chance of getting into one of the most selective universities in the world, and wants to turn it down for an apprenticeship job which would pay less than minimum wage? If she goes to uni and continues to perform as well as she has done she could easily graduate and walk straight into a high paying job. Both her dad and me went to top-tier institutions and found employment soon after graduating. Rachel is making a foolish mistake if she thinks she stands the same chance of a highly paid career by doing this apprenticeship. 

We had a massive row about it yesterday, in which we made clear that we did not support Rachel's career choice. We said that while we won't stop her from doing what she wants, we won't let her ruin her own life by turning down what many people would consider to be the opportunity of a lifetime. 

This made Rachel cry and say that we shouldn't force our own choices on her and make her feel bad for wanting to do something she enjoys. That wasn't our intention. We just want her to think of her own future."	Asshole	0	0

In the past few months, my mother has started to date someone— her best friends brother. Her best friend is not comfortable with this and the daughter of this woman is part of a larger group where I am friends with them. 

As of recent, 9-12 weeks, my mother has failed to spend time with me and spends the majority of week nights away with her boyfriend. I despise this and when she is at home she tends to tell me off for things out of my control or is continually sleeping. This is despite the fact that she is never around to spend time with me.

Now her 3rd child wants to come which is fair enough, and has been asking for a year, but the kids only 3, so too young. Now in November she asked and said can they come, I said no when is she 4 and was told February. Fair enough. January I ask again and am told March..... okay I might have miss heard. Fast forward to a week ago. Little one comes in and asks if she can come I ask the mother how old she is and am told 4.

I'm fuming. I'm the first aider and if something went wrong it's on my head. This club would get shut down and sued, and I dont want that. So I say I'll have a word with her at the end. 

This is the AITA bit. Shes the first parent in but I wait for the other parents to arrive, then go out to speak to her and in front of the other months say loudly, how shes lied, risked my job here, and say that if anything had happened that the club would be shut down and no kids would be able to come again and lay it on THICK. all the other parents are looking and this mums face drops and she says ""oh I'm really sorry, I wont bring her again until next year"" and she scurried out 

The parents that I'm friends with agree with me, but the other leaders say I was a dick for doing it and embarrassing her. AITA.

I (20F) am going to college, at first I thought I wanted to study animation so I did the paperwork in a public University that has that career, but after really thinking about it I realized I want to study cinematography, the problem is that career is only in private ones, so they cost money. After my dad passed away we started having a lot of problems with money because he was the one who was giving us money, so our economy is not good. 

So after thinking a lot, my mom (41F) decided to start working in two different places because she doesn't want me to work (I did wanted to work) and instead take care of the house and my sister (16F). Instead she told me to take her first job, that basically it's just answering the cellphone and whatsapps, it's very easy so I accepted and she gave me the cellphone and told me it was going to be mine now, since then I started adding my photos, my personal information, etc. Days go by and I found myself bored and lonely so I installed Tinder just for fun. I'm very close to my family so I don't hide anything from them, and since I didn't see it as a bad thing my sister found out easily. Some time after we were eating and talking so she told my mom joking, and... she took it veeery badly, it caught us off guard, I was laughing thinking she was joking too, but no, she started calling me names, a slut, that I'm selling myself, ""what are my friends going to think?"" She said that between other awful things, wich to be honest it pissed me off, she started demanding me to uninstall it, I'm very stubborn so I said no, she told me to return the cell phone to her if I wasn't deleting it, I said ""ok"", that pissed her off even more so she told me to figure out how I was going to pay my career because she wasn't going to pay for my University. I was awfully surprised by that. It's been days and she is still angry with me and won't change her mind.

At first I didn't feel like the asshole here but I asked in a Facebook group for advice and people were telling me that I was being spoiled for saying no to the person who gives me food, and a house to stay, etc. and that I should apologize to her, or telling me that I wasn't respecting myself enough for being in that app. So now I have doubts about what should I do."

He said it helped him, and he can tell Im having a hard time(which fuck him for butting into business that isn’t his). I was in therapy for a total of three years when I was younger. Two therapists and a psychologist. It was a total waste of my time and money. 

It was just not helpful for me. They would try to condescendingly tell me things about myself I know aren’t true. Like how my appearance is something people can overlook, which life experience has proven to me is wrong. How I do deserve to be loved, even though my family abused me when I was a kid. Again I know that’s not true, because if the people who are supposed to love you unconditionally hate you, I obviously don’t deserve to be loved by other people. 

When I brought up my abuse from childhood , it was brushed aside. Saying I never spoke about it before, so it really must not be an issue. Like, mother fucker it took so long for me to talk about it because it’s literally so painful for me to talk about. I wasn’t going to be vulnerable about it before I felt ready. I’m crying, literally crying as I say it, and it’s not an issue? 

There’s so, so much more I’m leaving out. But those examples prove my point. How can a therapist try to convince me the truths I know about myself aren’t true? I know myself better than anyone, who do you think you are trying to tear down the pillars of my ethos?

I, (M 16) am on a church trip, relevant to this story is my sister, who we’ll call S (F15, 20ish months younger than me), our mutual friend, who we’ll call A (F 17) and another one of our mutual friends (now my GF) who we’ll call GF. (F 16) 

So, I’ve had feelings for GF for a long time, various things have kept us apart, mainly me being an idiot or too timid to say anything, but I had decided enough was enough, and at some point during the church trip where all four of us were, I would ask her out. A and I were talking about it and she knew I was going to ask her out, so I talked to her and asked her to keep S out of the way (S, GF, and A have been nearly inseparable this whole trip.) 

Come yesterday, the last night of the trip, we’re all relaxing, and GF and I are relaxing in the lounge area, which is in a church basement with two rooms where the boys and girls are staying that night. I was helping GF make friendship bracelets the whole day, so it didn’t seem out of place that we were sitting together working on some more that people asked her to make. Most of the guys were messing around in our room, and the girls were going back and forth from their room to upstairs for food, so when we had a little bit, GF and I talked about our two year friendship and I asked her out, and we had a conversation that got pretty deep and personal, but when people would walk by we would start talking to them to make it seem slightly less suspicious. (Everyone pretty much knew we had feelings for each other and it was just a matter of me not being a pussy anymore)

Turns out, S and A we’re listening to the whole conversation through the door, which made me a little irritated. I knew that GF was going to tell them anyways, but I don’t think the girls deserved to listen in on our conversation, because I did talk about some of my regrets and got pretty personal. I called out A on Snapchat later, in private, because she knew it was going to happen and chose to listen in even though she would hear about it later. She tried to downplay it, but I was irritated, especially because she brought my sister to eavesdrop on the conversation, which is especially annoying because my sister can’t keep her mouth shut at all, and the last thing I needed is my personal struggles over the last 24 months made public to god knows who. 

I talked to my GF about it and she said that she understood why I was upset, but me snapping A about it last night and this morning was too much. I unfriended A temporarily, just because I’m incredibly irritated at what I see is a massive breach of trust. I also talked to my sister and she didn’t see what was wrong with it either, and I’m going to talk to her about it a little more when we get home because I don’t think she knows how much I see that as a betrayal.

c71q38	2019-06-29 16:59:32	CasperFriendlyToast	AITA - Who’s In My Driveway?	"I have a townhouse rental that was vacant for a couple of months with a driveway parking spot in front of the garage.  I go over to the rental as I was meeting some movers who were going to need the driveway to park and move some things out of the garage.   When I got there I noticed a car parked in my driveway also blocking access to the garage.   Btw - I parked in another area of the complex because I knew the movers would need my driveway spot.  I knocked on the townhouse next to me to ask them if it was their car.  No Answer although I thought I heard someone inside.  I then looked around and found a “no parking” sign that indicated the towing company for the complex.  Before calling I again knocked on the next door townhouse but no answer.   I still had about an hour before my movers were to arrive, so I went inside the townhouse and did a little work for another 15 minutes.  Then knocked on the neighbors door for a third time (Saturday morning around 9: 15am).  No answer but still thought I heard noise inside.  Still not sure who’s car it was and time running short... called the towing service.   They showed up and hauled away the car in 40 minutes and 5 minutes later my movers arrived and did the work I hired them to do Now it’s around 11:00am and we’re all done and leave....never really knowing who’s car it was.  About a month later I’m back over at the vacant rental and I see the next door renter for the first time...her garage door was opening and she was backing out of her driveway.  She’s a 40-50 year old woman and I say “hello”  and introduce myself.  She responded “You’re the guy that towed my sons car and cost him $400”.  I then told her I had knocked on the door several times and there was no answer.  And I said I wasn’t even sure who’s car it was ......she was late for work and quickly drove away.   I’m not even sure if she heard my last sentence.    Generally I like to get along with neighbors (in this case renters next to a currently vacant rental ). I rarely am at that property and don’t think I owe them and explanation at this point.

c71puu	2019-06-29 16:59:01		AITA for reaching out to a guy that my friend was mean to while under the influence?	"Throwaway account, obvious reasons.

Last night my friend and I thought that it would be a good time to just chill out, do some edibles, and have fun. So after about an hour, we are quite high. And she snap messages her friend, Joe, to come over. 

I’m sitting next to her (we are both women in our twenties) laughing and messaging Joe. And Joe replies with something that sounds like he’s quite hurt. We both don’t know why.

I try to talk to her about what happened and she doesn’t know what she said and says the snap didn’t save the messages. At this point, imagine a couple of high and bumbling idiots in the kitchen trying to have a conversation. However I can still detect that somethings wrong. She doesn’t seem to sense that something really is wrong and she doesn’t really address the situation with him.

So I message Joe separately and I tell him “hey we are high, she doesn’t really know what she said”. Like. My impression at this point is that she high texted him something dumb or something. But it’s clear he is very hurt. So I try to talk to him, trying to sound legible as I tend to not make much sense when I’m high. 

He tells me what she said, and while I won’t put that here it was hurtful in a way that you know it’s not something you’d say jokingly. So when she gets back (she was outside at this point) I wanted to talk to her about the situation but knew I wasn’t in much of a state to so I tell her that he’s actually really is hurt.

I’m not sure if I said I texted him or not. Or just had my phone that made it obvious. Regardless she realized I had texted him and got upset at me for inserting myself. And said that if it was something hurtful she could’ve just solved it later and talked to him later about it. I’m standing there angry and tell her that that’s not fair to Joe for you to sit there and say something incredibly hurtful and let him marinate on that all night. 

I would agree that maybe next time I shouldn’t high text someone either. I wasn’t trying to be a vigilante. I just didn’t feel like someone deserved to marinate on something so mean."	Not the A-hole	1	0

The time she said to pick her up rolls around & I message her to see if she's ready to go but says she is not ready & is in fact dancing. I thought that was strange but dismissed it as her being at a restaurant where you can eat & dance. 

The night goes on & I'm waiting at home for the all clear to come get her but finally at around 22:30 she tells me that its too late to see her friend & that I might see her tomorrow followed by a bunch of videos from the night showing that she wasn't out to dinner but actually at a house party for someone's 25th birthday, presumably a friend of the girl she was supposedly at dinner with. My gf messages me around 1:30 to tell me shes home. I have a short convo with her, quickly say goodnight & leave some of her messages unread because the whole situation has left me feeling irritated.

Some context on why I feel this way is needed so I shall explain. I have no problem with her going out & having a good time with her friends with or without me, I desire no control over her in that way. Where my gripe with the situation lies is that she veiled it as something it wasn't, flaked on other plans & possibly wasn't straight forward in telling me that she didn't want me to be there as from what I saw of the party it was not exclusive & I could have been her plus 1. Like I stated earlier I have no problem with her not wanting to bring me somewhere but I would appreciate knowing that that is in fact the case.

c71j1q	2019-06-29 16:47:26		AITA for wanting them to just let him go?	"So my adult (20m) stepson has started doing meth. Up until 3 days ago, this was unknown to the family, and even though we knew something was off, we didn't know it was this. 

So far, he was caught on video at work talking to people who weren't there, frantically pacing, and fighting a dumpster out back. The boss saw the videos, and he lost his job. However, he can get it back if he goes to detox and rehab. 

His father (my bf), his sister, and his parents went out looking for him when he wouldn't answer his phone, and found him at a well known drug house, using meth with his last pay check.

Since then, he has been staying at his grandparent's house (bf's parents), under more or less constant supervision by them, his father, and mother. 

He is agitated and aggressive, he wants to leave and go back to getting high. He doesn't care about anything else at this point. He has no desire at all to get help. This is obviously really hard on everyone involved, especially the grandparents. 

My bf has been home once in the past 3 days, because he doesn't want his son to leave and go back to the drug house, or get combative with his parents. 

I'm at home with my 3 kids, plus my other stepson (13m). Everyone's worn thin at this point, including me. Hopefully 13m's mom will come and get him tomorrow to give me a bit of relief, but she's not exactly reliable so we'll see.

AITA if I told the bf that they can't just hold oldest stepson basically hostage until they can convince him to get help, and to just let him go and be there to offer help when he's willing to accept it? That it's not fair to the elderly grandparents to have this combative person in their home, along with his parents hovering around him? I love the boy too, I just don't feel like being up his ass 24/7 is the right solution to this problem."		1	0
c71hqi	2019-06-29 16:45:22	A2I_WWJD	WIBTA for lying to a co-worker about moving?	"I work with a girl my age who we will call Amy. Amy is very needy and clingy. She thinks that we are friends, but I really need my distance from her. I also have a theory that she has this middle-school crush on me where she constantly shoots little insults at me to try and make me laugh while I just ignore it completely. We are not close enough for her to me able to make friendly insults. My roommate went to happy hour with my co-workers once and he said that he sees the same thing. 

Amy and I live in apartment complexes about 2 miles from each other. There have been several times over the past year where Amy has asked for rides to and from work for various reasons. Originally, it was the snow she said she isn't comfortable driving in. But more recently, it has turned into ""I forgot to get gas"" or ""traffic is crazy, shouldn't we carpool?"" To make matters worse, she usually gets upset with me when I am ""late"" coming to pick her up. I like to get to work right on time (which I have told her every time she calls me), while she prefers to be about an hour early. 

We have been working together for a year now, so my roommate and I will be signing our year #2 lease at the same place. However, I am thinking of telling Amy that we moved to a different town on the other side of where we work (so I wouldn't be able to drive her to and from work). 

WIBTA for telling her we moved? I don't want to straight up say ""please stop contacting me "" so I can preserve our professional relationship and refrain from hurting her feelings.

People generally pop their food in, stay near the machine till their food is warmed, collect their lunchbox and move along.
I was waiting in the line for a little while (the wait line was particularly long that day) and noticed that one of the microwaves had a box of food in it for the past 5-8 mins. The food had been warmed, but the owner was nowhere to be seen. When I was next in line to use one of the microwaves, I waited a couple of minutes, then removed the box, placed it to the side and popped in my food.

When I was nearly done with the heating cycle, the owner of the food finally showed up and was very annoyed that her food was outside. Her exact words were ""you don't touch other people's food"". I tried telling her the line was long and her lunch had held up the microwave for around 10 minutes, but she walked away muttering angrily under her breath.

"I (22f) have 2 sisters (24f and 18f) who both have very seriously illnesses, 18f was born with hers as 24f was diagnosed a few years ago. It’s likely that neither will live more than a few more years, (though technically there is a very very small chance they will live full lives). The exact timeline is unknown though, it could be quite a few years for either of them, it depends on how the diseases progress.

I moved away for college and graduated and now live about a 9 hour drive away. I stay in close contact with both. 18f and I are very close, and I know she misses me a lot. We always make special plans together and do fun stuff when a visit. I visit/see them every couple months. 

I have no desire to live in my hometown as it’s not a good place for me and there’s no real opportunities for me there. I get pretty depressed living there and don’t enjoy my life there. All my friend are in the new city. I’m very happy and fulfilled with my life in the new city, but can’t shake a feeling a guilt for being far from them. 

I remember I told a friend in middle school about their illnesses and she responded “well if my sister were sick I would spend every waking second with her” which is of course a nice sentiment, but unfortunately not realistic when it comes to real life. I wish I could be with them more but I also have my own life and dreams and should I put everything on hold? But what she said always haunts me and makes me feel guilty for leaving.

TL;DR my sisters are terminally ill and I moved away for work and can’t shake feeling of guilt.

c71dqd	2019-06-29 16:38:57	anon6020	AITA for forbidding my teenaged daughter from having social media after I found out she was engaging in inappropriate behavior?	"My daughter Emma is 16. She’s a good kid; part of the reason why I’m having such a moral dilemma right now. 

In the last couple months, I’ve noticed her having a lot more stuff than usual. For example, her mother found an Anastasia Contour kit in her room (just an expensive make-up kit that her mother and I DEFINITELY didn’t buy for her). She asked me about it because Emma doesn’t really have a disposable income; I didn’t really know where it came from but I didn’t really think anything of it. 

Well since then, there has been a bunch of new stuff she’s been getting. She’s been wearing new jewelry, clothes from expensive brands, some airpods, and yesterday, I saw that she brought home a new Nintendo Switch. At that point, I’m like WTF is going on, and confronted her. I demanded her to tell me where was she getting all of this stuff and I need an answer, now.

She pretended she had no idea what I was talking about, then that excuse changed to she’s been thrift shopping (which is completely a lie because all her stuff is brand new). After that fake excuse, I demanded to see her phone. She relented but told me she wanted to confess.

Well it turns out that she’s been getting DMs from a bunch of random guys. She has a pretty popular Instagram and posts quite frequently, so she had a lot of grown men hitting on her and offering to buy her stuff. She told me she was just entertaining them to get stuff, that she promises she never did anything appropriate like send nudes or have sex. She just messaged them, flirt a little bit, but that’s it, and they’d send her money.

I looked through her messages which pretty much confirmed what she said. Her conversations seemed innocent enough, but I still found it unacceptable that she was essentially willing to entertain these grown sick fucks just so they’d give her money. I told her such, and told her that because she did tell me, she’s not in huge trouble, but she’s banned from having snapchat, Instagram, and twitter until further notice (probably until she turns 18 and can make her own decisions). I thought it was a pretty fair resolution to the problem.

She did NOT have the same reaction. She said I couldn’t ban her, that all of her friends are on social media, and that it’d isolate her from everyone she knew. I told her as a compromise, she can make a new account but can’t post any pictures or anything and she threw a hissy fit and screamed how I was being unfair. I told her it was that, or she has no phone at all until she’s 18 so she can make her choice. She reluctantly agreed but she’s still EXTREMELY pissed at me. I reminded her she can still make one; she just can’t post anything, but she ignored this.

I didn’t really grow up with technology like she did, so perhaps I’m just thinking about it from an older person’s perspective. Thought to come here to see if my reaction was warranted."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I decided that I wasn’t going to wear them due to the fact that they’re 1) painful to walk in, and 2) look VERY scruffy and I’ve been told by colleagues that I really need to get them sorted out. I put on a different pair which were fully black EXCEPT some white stripes on the side of the shoes. 

So today, I went into work to start my shift. A manager was in the staff room, so I let him know the reason why I was wearing a different pair.  He completely understood and told me it was fine, and that I wasn’t going to be on the shop floor or in view of customers anyway.

c71a3c	2019-06-29 16:33:16		AITA for trying to prevent my Best Friend from giving away his kittens to someone with a flea infested home?	"This was yesterday and it's still bugging me.

So recently Best Friend's (Kevin) cat had kittens, 4 of them. I am taking one and Kevin found another friend to take another (we'll call them Robin).

NOTE: We all know each other, no one is a stranger. I'm just not close with Robin.

We were talking about kitten care, the mama, all that good stuff and we're trying to think of anyone who could take the other 2 kittens. I remember a couple that are good friends with Kevin, one of them LOVES cats so I say,

""Hey what about Tony and Dick? Dick loves cats!""

Kevin says ""Nah they might already have too many animals and not take one."" They have 2 dogs, a snake and a fish tank.

So I'm saying oh that sucks and we try brain storming other people who might want kittens. He asks me about my sister and I say hell no because she hardly does a good job of taking care of her little yorkie, it's so concerning even our mother refuses to let her take the dog when she moves out (basically moms dog now). Which is how we got on this topic. Kevin continues and lets me know that Robin is probably just as bad. Robin moved in with Tony and Dick so are all roommates, and she brought fleas with her when she had a rabbit. I'm thinking,

""Oh well I'm sure they got rid of them.""

NOPE. Kevin tells me the house has been flea infested for longer than a YEAR. The rabbit brought the fleas, the fleas got on to the dogs, and since then they've been making a community amongst themselves, building their economy, making relationships with other flea colonies! Kevin describes how he refuses to go back to their home because when he does it's absolutely disgusting (place is messy), and he gets eaten up with flea bites! I ask how come they haven't fixed the problem, why didn't Robin take the rabbit to the vet, wtf is going on?? He said more than likely because they just live an expensive life style and don't have anything left over for the animals expect food. Basically making bad choices. I asked him did Robin still have the rabbit and he said no and he doesn't know how it died either....

I tell him, ""You can't be fucking serious right? You're going to give a kitten to someone who lacks responsibility and has a flea infested home...?""

Kevin just shrugs me off like ""Hey what we gonna do, we gotta get rid of these kittens."" and I tell him Yeah! BUT TO GOOD HOMES. I tell him having a flea infestation like that can get animals sick and it's ridiculous they've even let the 2 dogs deal with it for this long! I begged him to at least make them get rid of the fleas first if he's so set on giving Robin a kitten, but I don't know for sure if they'll do it. I'm thinking of maybe visiting myself to see how bad it is, and if it is maybe calling animal control if it's obvious the animals are sickly and in poor health, but Best Friend just thinks that's extra drama.

at this point she makes more rude comments and at this point i cannot be bothered with her. i tell her she needs to clean up her act otherwise no one will want to be around her. she says she has friends who are going to the same high school as her and i said they wont be her friends for long if she keeps acting this way.

a few hours later, my mum tells me that what i said was wrong and that she's acting out because she's nervous. i tell her that maybe, but she's been acting like this for years even before me moved across the country. i told her that i have tried to have normal conversations with her only to be blanked or have a snarky comment thrown at me. i tell her that i'm done trying with her and that she can continue like this and see where it gets her. 

Btw, she doesn't swear regularly yet though she knows them and does swear at me and my brother who are both older then her and when no one else is around. she's rude to me and my bro and is occasionally to my mum but she just says she tired as an excuse. i've tried with her but i am at my wits end and even though my mum is beginning to see it now that it is the summer holidays, she still tells me to try, try ,try.

I am acutely aware that different cultures treat children differently and I am more than fine with that. 

So... Last week we had a stopover in Istanbul. People there are so affectionate with children, they shower them (including mine) in praise and attention. It’s lovely. On our flight from Istanbul to Northern Europe my seven year old son had to sit in the seat across the aisle from me. No problem, this often happens. He is well traveled and can handle screen, food service, bathroom trips on his own. 

He fell asleep. His head was dangling, but no biggie. The old man sitting in the window seat swiftly moved to the middle seat so my son could rest his head on his shoulder. How kind. 

But... Then he tried to drape a blanket over both of their laps with his hands underneath the blanket. Nope. Not happening. I told him no and he pulled the blanket off. But he kept sort of nudging my son with his elbow. I asked him several times to stop. He did not understand English. He also didn’t understand Livid Mother. 

Then he caressed my sons face. I got the attention of a flight attendant and told them to get the man away from my son. They asked why. Then laughed and said he was just an old grandpa trying to help. 

They looked at me as if I was some crazy asshole. 

I started to get up and told them I was going to fucking touch him and not in a kind way. They stepped in and took over. They moved my son. 

The old man looked both angry and sad. 

I usually live in a pretty black and white world - I know when I am in the right and when I when I have done someone wrong. 

I have no fucking clue with this one. The attendants seriously looked at me like I was some whacky evil bitch. I told them what he had done. 

Was I the asshole?"		1	0
c717vz	2019-06-29 16:29:43	heatwavelaze	AITA for communicating with my daughter only in my language, not English?	"I am an American who has lived in the US her whole life. My parents are from India, and the 2 main languages they speak are Gujarati and Hindi. They have been US citizens for over 50 years now and safe to say we are proud to be Americans, and love our country. 

My ex is American with Dutch ancestry & he only speaks English. I was with him for 1.5 years, before I unexpectedly fell pregnant (my BC failed) and my parents found out pretty much straight away because nosy Indian parents will find a way to know everything. 

The outpouring of love and support from my 2 old folks was tremendous and they were staunchly on my side and babies side especially because when I told my ex I was pregnant he bailed and went MIA for 3 entire years (he still paid CS) the rest of the Indian community basically shunned me and called me a whore but my parents stuck by me. 

I moved back with my parents and they added an entire wing to their home just for me and my baby. They speak only Gujarati at home, as my parents have multiple businesses in India, and they prefer it. My mom and dad only speak to my kid in Gujarati and asked that I make sure she knows her heritage and her home. 

I spoke with a child psychologist who told me it is absolutely healthy and okay for her development if I speak minimal English with her at home, because she’s exposed to so much American culture via external sources / tv and I speak English when I’m around others including with her when we are out and about. 

My ex came back into my life when my daughter was 3 because he had a change of heart and wanted to meet his daughter. He has fallen head over heels in love with her and begrudgingly I have to say he is a fantastic father and my daughter absolutely loves him. She’s 6 now and the two both look exactly the same as well as act exactly the same- he is very charismatic and silly and he has taught her those qualities because I’m pretty boring and serious and she has really opened up in a way I’m proud to see. 

His only ‘complaint’ is that she babbles to herself in Gujarati ALL the time and my ex hates it. He also feels that I’m delaying her development by strictly speaking in Gujarati when I’m at home and that it’s un-American of me. He has also expressed dissatisfaction that he can’t understand her and that he’s missing out on sweet moments because sometimes she can’t translate into English. She can speak English perfectly but she seems more confident in Gujarati, which I myself have noticed. 

I told him that he can either learn Gujarati or put up with our daughter being more comfortable in Gujarati. He thinks I’m being difficult on purpose but I really don’t feel like I’m doing anything wrong."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c7177o	2019-06-29 16:28:34		WIBTA if I did something about my partner’s sister’s hoarding problem?	"So my partner and I have been dating for almost four years, and I’ve gone to her family events and am friendly with her sisters, especially the one that lives closest by. Recently she, her mom, her sister, and her sister’s husband moved into adjoining houses. Before they all lived together, I knew that my partner’s sister (I’ll just abbreviate to PS) had quite a few animals, but I underestimated just how many.

In the room that joins the two houses together, she has twenty one cats. This room is about fifteen feet by maybe fifty, and all of the cats are left loose in this room together. As you can imagine, it smells awful, and the smell sometimes even escapes into the house. They also have a turtle in a cage in this same room-on the floor, where the cats can get to it-and sometimes leave two of their four dogs in this room with the cats when they leave for work.

They had twenty two cats, but one of them passed away. I’m not sure why-no one will tell me what happened-and another one of the cats is sick, and I wouldn’t rule out bad conditions as to why this cat is sick.

Shoving this many cats in a small space-and letting her dogs pee and shit on the floor in there-is sickening to me, especially because I have a cat myself and, like many people, I love animals. Seeing them crammed into this small space is disgusting to me. I’ve mentioned it to my partner again and again that we should do something before her sister kills all of these cats or gets more of them to stuff in a small room. I’m also worried that the cats’ heath is being neglected, especially after the one cat getting sick recently. It’s hard enough to keep an eye on four dogs, in addition twenty plus cats.

Would I be an asshole if I intervened in some way? I’m not talking calling animal control or anything-not yet, anyways-but mentioning something to PS. I’ve also considered saying something to my partner’s mom. She owns the houses and could put her foot down about the situation, especially since PS and her husband ruined their last house because of the number of animals they have (and I mean that-the carpets used to be beige but turned brown due to shit stains and the dogs and cats ruined walls&furniture). There’s plenty of shelters in our area, and she could even put the cats up for adoption herself.

Tldr; My partner’s sister is a fledgling animal hoarder and I want to say something to her and offer my help in fixing the situation."	Not the A-hole	1	0
c7170b	2019-06-29 16:28:15	Rohrin	AITA for not bullying someone?	"So this happened to me several years ago but I still think about it every now and then.

A few years ago I was dating around and matched online with a law student at a very prestigious university. We went out for dinner and I learned that she had started a very successful anti-bullying foundation in high school after some bad experiences and that probably helped her get into said university.

The date ended and I didn't feel much of a connection but agreed to keep chatting online. A few weeks later I get a late night message from her asking if I'm up. Being a young, horny man I said of course! She comes over and, unsurprisingly, things start getting sexual quickly. 

We start doing the deed and almost immediately she asks that I talk dirty to her. Now I'm TERRIBLE at dirty talk. I don't know why, but I have the voice of someone with social anxiety asking for extra ketchup whenever I try to talk dirty. It doesn't go over well but she keeps pushing me. She says ""tell me I'm stupid"" which also felt weird so I'm not able to be convincing. Eventually she looks me in the eyes and says ""I want you to BULLY me.""

I stopped having sex and said that I felt really uncomfortable. It's literally the only time in my life that I've stopped having sex mid-way through. I didn't shame her or anything, I just felt really freaked out. I said that I wasn't in the mood anymore. She was really uncomfortable and left right afterwards.

I wonder if my reacting that way was the right move. Should I have tried to talk with her afterwards? I kind of laugh about the story now but I still wonder if I was the asshole."	No A-holes here	0	0
c716pw	2019-06-29 16:27:48		AITA for yelling at a 12-year old for impersonating a blind person at a hockey game?	"So I saw a post on here where someone asked if they were the asshole for being mean to a child, and it reminded me of a similar incident two years ago what I did at a pro hockey game. So anyway here it is. 

&#x200B;

At this hockey game, I was going for a refreshment between periods and saw a young kid, probably around 12, who was wearing a referee outfit, but with those thick dark glasses that blind people wear as well as a blind man's cane. He was laughing and pretending to feel his way through the crowded corridor by tapping the floor with the cane as a way to criticize what he thought was poor refereeing. For some reason, it just really made me furious because of how horribly unfair it is to be born blind and if a blind person could see him (I'm not making a joke here), then it would be very hurtful. Also, there likely would be someone at the game who at least knew a blind person and would be offended. 

&#x200B;

Now I understand im not the humor police, nor is it my job to be offended on someone else's account, but for some reason it really made me mad, and so I walked up to him and told him that I had a blind family member (a lie), who would not think what he's doing is very funny. I went a bit further, and told him ""how dare you make fun of disabled people!"" So the kid immediately put his head down and walked away.  I think he was really upset, although I could not tell if he was crying or not. Ive been to several games at that arena since, haven't seen him again.

There have also been other concessions for this trip that I'm not thrilled about.

 My wife is also tempted to keep it a secret but says sharing the prize if anyone won was implied, since everyone entered the contest and also held off on buying tickets until the sweep was over.

The only difference besides some money saved to my brother is we are staying 10 miles away from the  park when we go next month, and the hotel from the conteat package is in the park itself."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I was bored, so i snapped him saying how that’s really cool and congratulating him for it. He thanked me, sent me a copy of his script, and asked for my number. I gave it to him, we talked that night about what I thought about this script, writing, work, etc. Then, I went to bed. The next day he was nonstop texting me (while I was at work). I didn’t want to be mean, so I answered as much as I could, kept up the conversation. The next day was the same, nonstop texting me. I could tell he was getting the wrong idea, he was asking for pics of me, constantly talking about how sweet I was (which is nice, but I didn’t want him to get the wrong impression). I didn’t want to lead him on, cause I figured that would be mean cause the feeling was unrequited. So, I started answering slower and less, answering with dry texts, etc. But, he kept it up. He then asked me to hang out, and I rly didn’t want to because 1. Again, I didn’t want to lead him on 2. I really am not social lol, and I have trouble making connections with people outside of my small friend group. He wouldn’t take the hint after all that I did, so I just haven’t answered. I kinda feel like a dick for doing that, cause he’s a nice guy, don’t get me wrong, but he’s just rly not the type of person i’d hang out with.

c70zsf	2019-06-29 16:17:04	underneathabove	AITA for not wanting to work during my cousin's wedding?	"\*Update below!

&#x200B;

My cousin is getting married in August - a destination wedding out in the mountains of Colorado. My husband and I are professional filmmakers and do a lot of work together. We own our own equipment and both act as operators sometimes, or otherwise we hire additional crew and take on different roles, depending on the job.

My cousin - who I am decently close to - asked if my husband and I will video her wedding for her. This was after we received her invitation, RSVP'd yes, and after we've purchased our plane tickets / booked our hotel. She says she will pay us a 'small stipend', but she loves our work and can't find a good videographer out in this small town in Colorado.

My husband and I don't want to do it. Not only would we have to cart all of our gear out to Colorado, but that's all we'd be doing the whole wedding. My cousin is super particular, really picky, and despite her saying that it would be okay if we only captured the best moments, those 'best moments' are all over a wedding. (We also don't film weddings - we've never filmed a wedding previously. The small work we do as a 2 person crew is mostly for non-profits.) You just have to be filming the whole time. How would it ever work for us to be guests, and be paid videographers? We aren't taking time off, paying $800 each for plane tickets, and the hotel etc etc just so we can work for way below our regular rate. We wouldn't be experiencing the wedding, we'd just be working - doing our regular job for this event. Also, I don't think it would be right for me to even accept the 'small stipend' from her any way - so we'd be doing it for free.

My cousin has said that she wants us there 'first and foremost' as guests, but I know that her ideal would be for the whole wedding to be filmed. If we do get to put down our cameras though, we will have to be charging batteries, or downloading footage. It's not something, for a one night event, that you can just stop doing to enjoy yourself.

I'm worried that saying no to my cousin will ultimately really hurt our relationship - but I genuinely feel she doesn't understand what a commitment this is for me and my husband to do for her, and, if I explain it all to her, I think she'll just hear me say 'no', without getting it. I'm really proud of my husband and my work together, and I know my cousin is expecting something of that caliber. It won't be of that caliber if we don't film the whole thing ... never mind watching through all the footage and editing, and probably hiring our composer to write something for the piece (what we usually do with our commercial work, and what my cousin is used to seeing from us).

I feel so torn up about this. I want my cousin to be happy, and she's definitely known to fly-off-the-handle (she held a grudge with my sister for months over something petty a few years ago) ... but I don't want to work during her wedding that I'm already paying a lot of money to attend.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** I emailed her saying I don't have experience with weddings and it would be a disservice to her to not hire a real wedding videographer. I offered to look up some in the area and asked for her budget / who she's spoken to already. She called me, saying that it doesn't matter that I don't have the experience, and it would mean so much to her. She said she's over budget and loves my work so much. I told her that we really want to be there and enjoy it, and she said she'd make sure we had a good time regardless ... agh.

We're thinking about skipping the wedding entirely and pretending we booked a big gig that we can't turn down or something? We don't want to start a precedent of working for family ... feel like it will become a pattern if we say yes and do it. We were able to turn down a commercial due to timing for my uncle's business (on the other side of the family) who wanted a big discount ... we can't start working for family for free now.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE:** I called her this morning and told her we can’t do it. It's beyond our weight limit for our carry ons / suitcases without paying extra (which is true), we have a ton of other work we're editing currently (also true), and I want to be there with my family to celebrate her, not to work (true) … and that, even if we just brought one camera and minimal gear, it wouldn't be up to the quality she wants, or the quality I'd want her to have in a wedding video (true). She was pretty upset about it but said in the end that they weren't planning on hiring a videographer anyway - and a video was something additional they could live without. She just thought it wouldn't be a big deal for me to make something for them ... but she said she was expecting us to both be filming, and for us to bring our professional gear and make it like a ""normal wedding video"".

I ended the conversation by saying that we can't wait to celebrate with her, and she didn't push it any further, she was still kind of pissed. So ... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

c70vqn	2019-06-29 16:10:26	natilicious	AITA for not paying for my takeaway?	"For background context -I do not currently have a bank card. 

Yesterday I ordered an Indian takeaway and selected the ""pay by cash"" option. The total of my takeaway was 28 in my country's money. 

Takeaway came 40 minutes late. Okay, little bit irrated but it happens, maybe traffic or issues with the driver or kitchen. No biggie. I had a 50 note to pay for my takeaway, meaning I'd need to get 22 back. Driver arrives, is supposed to hear that this is a cash order. His boss didn't give him any money to give out change to customers, I only have 50 and 100 notes. Absolutely no use.

He calls his boss, tells him this was a cash order. Boss gets on the phone and asks me if it's OK if the driver comes by for the money tomorrow as they're busy tonight. I tell him it's no problem and I'll be home up until 3pm.

At this point I'm very hungry, very excited for my Indian.  Only to open up my Tikka Masala to find something that doesn't resemble one. I phone up the restaurant and ask them if there was a mistake - I describe what weird oniony concoction I have received instead of a Tikka Masala. The guy says that kitchen or whoever was packing up the meal must have messed up as that's their special today - some sort of lamb dish. I don't eat lamb. Naturally I ask if it would be okay if the driver dropped off the curry I ordered at my house. He speaks to the boss and says that they're too busy tonight - I don't think the boss realised it was the same person on the phone with his employee to whom he spoke to before. 

I survive on some oatmeal and garlic naan (?) and tuck in for the night. Following day, as promised, I'm home up until 3pm. Nobody comes. I come to a conclusion that since my order was wrong anyways, they just let me off.  

Cue 3 hours later.  I get a phone call from the boss, same man I spoke to yesterday. Informing me that the driver is outside my door to collect money - I explain to him that I was only home until 3pm which I clearly said to him during the conversation. Furthermore I do not think I should pay for my curry as I was given the wrong order - I'm 100% okay paying the delivery fee and cost of naan bread. At this point the owner gets very angry and says that I can't be ""scamming"" him like this and I can't expect to get a takeaway for free. He says it's my fault for not having the exact money to the driver in the first place. Furthermore he says that unless I drop off money at his resturant paying for the meal - the driver will have to pay for it out of his own pocket.  

The resturant is only a 15 minute drive by car from me. But I do not drive. It's a 45 minute walk or 30 ish minutes on a city bus. So now I'm expected to find time out of a pretty busy week of my life, to go to a restuarnt and pay for a curry that I didn't order or I'll have to live with the guilt of a poor delivery driver having to pay the fee.

 But about 5 hours in they were catching up with a mutual friend on a Skype call with someone who I obviously don't know. Old mutual friend of theirs. After 45 minutes I just left. 

Didn't want to interrupt their call. AITA?

Edit: they tried to involve me in the call but I'm not too great at the language they were talking. Not my first language.  Also I'm socially awkward and introverted. Showing up at the barbeque was hard but necessary to move forward the relationship plus i wanted to meet her friends. But the random Skype call I felt uncomfortable AF

Edit 2: I actually posted to see if I would be the asshole. Since I've already got two YTAs  and an ESH I'm just going to sit here silently and awkwardly until I figure out a graceful way to exit. No further replies necessary

Final update: I  sat awkwardly  for 15 more minutes and chirped in with two minor comments with what I understood in the call. One of the more extroverted participants on our side noticed my exclusion and started talking to me in English and we had a conversation. This made the person on the other end of the call feel out of the loop and so she just disconnected.

That caused some drama amongst them. But I ended up not looking like the asshole and exited gracefully 2 hours later. Thanks everyone for the speedy yta's which prevented me from being the douche"	Asshole	0	0

So like I said I still see her all the time. I’ll make some small talk, but I’ve really just kind of distanced myself from her.

I’m not mad at her or anything. I’m mad at myself for not being more. But I dunno, I just can’t be her friend when I’m gutted inside. She’s just so...everything, and I can’t be around her. I’ll always make a fool of myself, because she just pushes my buttons so to speak. AITA??"	No A-holes here	0	0

I also want to get it straight that I have a tendency to not care that much about my health, I know it's not good but it's my choice and I'm ready to face the consequences, furthermore, I have more important priorities. (please note that I have stated all of this in a very respectful manner to my family) 

So the thing is, for past few years, my mother has been freaking out about my health issue, mostly from over-reading and over-believing internet symptoms. She would wake me up at 00:00 Am, 3 Am and 5Am just to drink water (for my health which later cause me feeling grumpy for my morning work) ; nagging me about staying up late because I have  to do my work (audit life) ; assume that I dont  drink any water and keeps yelling, litterally, for how much water I have ;change the entire menu for our meals (she stops using sugar, soy sauce, fish sauce all together. Only salt now.) and everything is bland (I'm sorry but I really love foods) ; other family members are blaming me for my rebellious attitude, for not keeping my mouth shut when she starts her tantrums; screaming at my father for not being able to ""care enough"" for her children ; put herself on a diet with ONLY boiled vegetables and guess what, she became grumpy and blamed all of us, ; not to mention ALL we ever talk about now is how she had her problems but she has do all this for me, etc.

There are more but what set the bomb for me was on the week I have to run for reports, I was tired and stressful and she was screaming hysterically for not listening to her, for not obeying her in her daily routine.

She complained that she had to sacrifice too much for this routine and I was taking it for granted. I snapped, told her that if doing all those things for me is a burden to her, she should stop doing that for all I care and do something about her own health issues.

c70p5j	2019-06-29 16:00:46	LezBeeAnn	AITA for telling my dad not come for my birthday?	"Bit of a small(ish) backstory. Back when I (F22) was in high school (I don't remember the specific years), my dad made a mistake and cheated on my mom. A couple of months after the divorce was final, and they were done screaming at each other, he got remarried. To *the woman,* if you catch my drift. And of course, this made her my stepmother. So for a couple of years, I lived with them because I was stupid and I'm super attached to my dad. But as I was living with them, I noticed that my dad and I started hanging out less. She would always invite herself, even if my dad and I had plans to do something together, she would be right there. Whenever we WERE able to go somewhere, which was when she was working and he was off, she would quite literally call every five minutes. Shit got annoying real quick. 

&#x200B;

So fast forward to last September-October. At that point, I had moved back in with my mom because living with my dad and stepmom was becoming tiring. My mom was becoming depressed because she basically had nobody, so we decided to move back to our hometown in Georgia. We've been here ever since, living with family and it's been great. Cut to now. I'm almost 23, I'll be 23 on July 18th (not to borderline doxx myself lol). Yesterday night, my dad called me and told me that he was coming down to see me for my birthday, which you could probably imagine my excitement (despite all the other times we tried to hang out before). I was so excited that I kept myself up and didn't fall asleep until like 4 am. Today, something came over me and told me to ask him if my stepmom was coming too. Of course he said yes, she is going too. 

&#x200B;

I got emotional. Because at this point, it's been almost a year since I've seen my dad and we've only been communicating through text/call. So when I saw that, I broke down crying like a little girl. To that, I replied, ""Noooo, why does she have to go everywhere with you?"" He didn't respond, so I got even more emotional and replied ""Just like mom told you, if she's coming then don't come at all,"" and left it at that. Now I'm starting to think that maybe I was a little too jerk-ish. Because a part of me feels like I shouldn't care who is with him, because he's my dad and I should want to see him regardless. But the other part of me feels like it's morally wrong because 1, her being with him would be disrespectful towards my family and my mother and 2, I don't wanna have to schedule seeing him *around* my family to avoid conflict. I also just don't want her here, I don't want her to be with my dad because it feels invasive and like I'm put on the back burner. As awful as this sounds, but nobody here likes her lol so it's also pointless for her to come.

He was twelve and has never really had much of a relationship with that side of the family because of the divorce, just his aunt and uncle. I don’t think he’s seen his grandparents in four or so years and says he just has absolutely no care to (and means it). I have a very open schedule except for two hours this morning when I went to school to take a test, drive included.....and he went to his grandparent’s house. I’m super close with his mom’s side so it isn’t like he’s hiding me from the family, plus I currently talk to his aunt and uncle probably 75% more than he does, but idk, I’m a little hurt. I know it isn’t all about me and I’m happy for him going to see him, but idk, it kinda stings that he waited the only two hours I was gone to do it. We’ve been together a long time and I know the ins and outs of his family so it isn’t like there’s anything he’d be embarrassed about. I’m just kinda hurt but I don’t want to say something and make it all about me because it’s his life and I’m happy for him, I just wish I could be there.		1	0

c70mdn	2019-06-29 15:56:57	throwaway942790	AITA for wanting to give a cheater a second chance?	A few months ago I hooked up with this guy. I didn't know it at the time, but he had a girlfriend. One day, he told me that he was in an open relationship, so I figured that he was telling the truth and we hooked up again. A little while later, I noticed that he was being suspicious, so I messaged his girlfriend on Facebook to make sure that they were actually in an open relationship. It turns out that they did not agree on an open relationship. She confronted him and he denied ever hooking up with me, saying that I was just some random girl who kept trying to hook up with him. I sent his girlfriend screenshots of him and I's Snapchat conversations and he finally broke down and admitted that he had lied to both of us. His girlfriend dumped him (obviously) and I was mad at him for a really long time, too. However, I have forgiven him and am considering possibly hooking up with him and being friends again. His ex-girlfriend seems to have moved on and started seeing someone new, but I wouldn't want to hook up with him again if it would hurt her feelings.

c70l14	2019-06-29 15:54:59	roastthisnut	AITA for supporting my step-daughter’s decision to have an abortion	"This whole thing is a convoluted mess, so bear with me. 

I have a step-daughter, 17, who just informed us and her mother that she’s pregnant. She wasn’t sure what she wanted to do at first, but was leaning towards abortion. Her mother is extremely pro-life (despite having had an abortion herself) and her father and myself are pro-choice. 

We told my SD that we would support whichever decision she made, and we also gave her our opinions as to what we would do in her situation. She decided last night to have the abortion, and informed all of us. Her mother is now accusing us of providing unbiased information, and that she, as a nurse, is the only one unbiased and qualified enough to keep her from making a “rash decision”. She is now coming over to “wring my child hating bitch neck” for telling her my opinions, and is threatening to take my SO to Children & Youth Services for this. 

All I told my SD is that I would have an abortion if I were in her shoes, and told her why. I also told her that she may have better success in life if she waits until she’s older and more established to have a child. We informed her that we would both support whichever decision she made, even if we may not agree with it. 

After she made the decision to abort, she told me that she’d rather I go with her to the appointment than either parent, as she thinks going with her father would be awkward, and she knows that her mother would try to convince her not to have the procedure the entire time. I agreed, and her mother (so far) doesn’t know that I’m the one who made the appointment and is going with her. 

She seems to have more anger with me than anyone else in this situation, and I really don’t know why. I don’t think that I said anything out of bounds and I really don’t think this warrants my being an asshole. 

But I’m coming to you, fellow redditors, to ask if I’m actually the asshole. If I am, PLEASE tell me why, and how I can possibly rectify this. I’m so lost, here."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I don't have a lot of friends and one of my best friends (or possibly even my best) has just basically cancelled our monday plans together in order to go on a short holiday with someone else. Now, my friend, let's call him N, basically told me he couldn't refuse the offer because this new friend planned out a whole lot of high class shit for them to do. Nice flight, nice cars, nice restaurants, all that.

Now, while I can understand that those are really, really tempting offers, I feel pretty fucked over getting dumped over some dude N knows for maybe a month (and doesn't actually like that much) while we have known eachother for about three years now.

I've told him that I won't stop him and he may as well go now since I don't want to hang out with him, knowing he'd rather be somewhere else right now. I've also told him I'm disappointed, sad and a little angry over this whole thing and do not wish to speak to him for the forseeable future.

They have a very big family, of which I have met now on numerous occasions and feel like an extended part of their family. I was sitting at the dining room table with 5 or 6 other people. I had my purse, drink, and snack all in front of me. I was sitting there for 45 minutes to an hour. I got up to use the bathroom, leaving all my stuff at the spot. When I came back, a new guest had arrived and was sitting in my seat. I said ""I'm sorry I was sitting here"" and pointed to my stuff. He shot me an angry look and got up, sat in a different chair, and did that sarcastic ""Sorrrr-eee"" under his breath. I said something to my bff later at the party that I think I pissed off one of her relatives. I explained the situation and who it was, and she rolled her eyes, saying he's weird anyway.

I had this photo of my wife from the first apartment we ever had together 25 years ago. Topless, in heels, and I have the perfect spot for the placement of the tattoo. She knows I love this photo, knows I wanted to get the tattoo but I guess never thought it would happen. So I'm off work this week. I made the appointment. She knew about it. She picked up the money from the bank (the place is cash only) and handed me the money. While I'm on the table she texts me, ""I'm not so sure about this...""

It definitely is a tattoo I cannot show family. Definitely not safe for work. Her biggest objection is that she is embarrassed by it. If I'm being honest, I guess I knew she wasn't crazy about it but had no idea it would upset her this much. I could have picked several other photos, but I was just fixated on this one. And it had to be her, not some other model or someone else's art.

c70gu5	2019-06-29 15:48:29	LimpSuspect	AITA for getting angry at my friends for not meeting me?	"So I (18M) have two friends whom I haven't met for nearly 3 years (We're not a group of three). Let's call them M and A (Both 18F). They're two of my closest and best friends, and the other way round as well.

Now M has college now, but she did say that we would meet when she had the time to. Now she's swamped with college work now and I understand that, but she still goes out with her college friends pretty often. We do live far away so that might be a factor. Recently, she comes online but doesn't text me, or when she does, it's almost impossible to keep a conversation going because the responses I get are like, one word. I told her how I felt about this and she told me that she was getting annoyed. I didnt do anything or say anything to get her that way except everything I outlined above. 

A has a boyfriend and a group of friends whom she does go out with every now and then. She and I planned on going to a movie together, and she said she had to ask her mother (possessive mom), which she never bothered to do. However, if she has to go with literally anyone else, she asks her mom straight away. It's always some excuse or the other when she has to ask her mother to meet me, but when she can meet someone else, it's no problem.

c70fwz	2019-06-29 15:46:10	Be_Braver	AITA for not helping my sister move?	"My sister and her fiancé are moving out of my parents basement today. Originally the date was set for July 6th, but her fiancé was really excited and they technically could move in at any point after June 25th. I was going to help her move, or volunteer my fiancé because only one of us is able to go since we just brought home an 8 week old puppy, and he isn’t fully vaccinated/house broken/will be more of a hazard there. By July 6th the puppy would have been with us for 2 weeks and my fiancé who works during the week will have had a weekend to practice the routine I set up for the puppy. He hasn’t had a puppy before.

When my sister decided to move the date she sent out a group text to me, my fiancé (m), & friends asking for help. My dad, mom, & younger brother 17 already agreed to help. I explained that I couldn't do any of the heavy lifting with the pup, but that I would happily help unpack boxes, this way my fiancé could help with the heavy lifting. My sister & her fiancé are both females & so is everyone she asked to help move other than my fiancé. Normally that doesn't matter but men are generally stronger than women & are better at lifting heavy things. She told me that she doesn't think they will be unpacking any of the boxes & that she couldn't really use my help if I can't move the actual boxes with the puppy. I offered to come help on Sunday (tomorrow) to unpack the boxes with her if she wanted, she said she has work but I could ask her partner. All this happened a week ago.

Earlier this past week my mom asked if my fiancé was going to help. I told her unfortunately no. My mom didn't respond. Today my brother texted me sarcastically ""Really nice to have you and XXX over to help! Made life much easier for us."" My brother often reflects what my parents think. So they are also mad at me. We are a super close family & generally things like this get taken personally and linger…

My fiancé isn't comfortable going without me, & I couldn't go without him because he has been working all week & is still learning how to care for a puppy. Plus we have another adult dog that still getting used to the puppy which adds a whole other complication. My family (not my sister) is now making me feel guilty for not helping, & will probably hold it against me/guilt me for a few weeks about it, as has happened in the past. (Literally my mom got SUPER upset for me not showing up the day before thanksgiving to help her clean her house even though she didn't ask for my help and the guilting/shaming me for that lasted over a week when I didn't even know it was an expectation.) So AITA for not helping, or is my family being unforgiving of bad timing? My family is so good at guilting me I keep thinking ""Well if I leave now, I can still help"" even though that isn't what is best for my home right now.

Edit: Typo- actual vs. actually

UPDATE: My brother confirmed everyone in my family is upset with me, including my sister now. I explained the situation to him and he said ""I didn't know taking care of a 9 week old puppy required more than one person. Learn something new every day I guess."" I replied nicely, about how they are similar to babies at this age but can't wear diapers, trying to make light of it. he said ""That was sarcasm."" I replied nicely again he said ""I'm glad your happy with your dog but we're all kind of bummed that you and/or XXX didn't come over to help. I'm absolutely positive you could have handled one day by yourself with two dogs. Family is more important than a puppy."""	Not the A-hole	0	0

c70efz	2019-06-29 15:42:36		AITA for calling my gf's friend a sexist over an argument about the Women's World Cup?	"TLDR at the bottom

&#x200B;

**Background**: 

I'm a massive sports fan. I watch both male and female sports. However, I've 0 interest in soccer. I read the headlines and watch some of the goals, controversial incidents etc so I can make small talk with my friends, but I've only sat down and watched a full match only 3-4 times in my life because I find the sport unbearable to watch.

&#x200B;

**The Incident:**

I met with my gf in the city to get lunch. After lunch, we ran into 4 of her friends. There was a soccer game on in a bar in a few hours so they tried to convince us to go watch it. My gf wanted to go. I said she can go but I'm going to head back home because I have work to do and don't want to watch the game. Her friends tried to convince me to go but I stood firm in wanting to go home. 

One friend asked in a snarky tone -  ""is it because it's a woman's match and you'd watch it if men were playing?"". I completely disagreed with her. I hate soccer and wouldn't watch a men's game either. I also said it was pretty rude to assume that I wouldn't watch it since it's a woman's match. She pushed back pretty strongly. My gf tried to stand up for me but her friend wouldn't drop it. I got quite frustrated and said something along the lines of - ""it's ironic you're criticising me for not watching women's sport since I know for a fact that you have very little interest in sport (let alone soccer) and I have spent more time in front a screen/pitch-side watching women's sport in the last 6 months than you have in your lifetime"". I added that she was sexist for assuming that I don't support women's sport because I'm a man and that she wouldn't have criticised a female friend if they didn't want to watch this match. This caused her to get really angry and she started crying.

My gf and I went home and she called me a douche for making her friend cry. I explained the situation to my friends and the majority are on my side but the minority strongly believe that I was out of line calling her a sexist and should have just gone to watch the game. So, AITA?

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

I'm sports-mad but hate soccer. My gf's friends wanted us to go to a bar to watch a women's world cup game. I had work to do plus I hate soccer so I declined the offer. One friend strongly implied that I was sexist for not wanting to watch the game. I pushed back and ended up calling her a sexist which caused her to cry. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c70ebn	2019-06-29 15:42:17		AITA for going home away after my boyfriend refused to apologize for shouting at me in the middle of a street?	"So, we were walking a city we were visiting and, since my phone was dead and I couldn't recharge it, I asked my boyfriend to look for directions. We frequently ask each other to do small things like these. He started looking and, as I saw him open the browser instead of opening the app, I got a little irritated. He frequently does things in an unpractical way which obviously take more time. He got irritated as well and started shouting at me instead of talking normally. At that moment, I asked him to apologize for shouting at me (he almost never apologizes for anything) but he refused, as I expected, so, since I didn't know how to make him understand that I won't allow him to treat me like that without him acknowledging he's hurt me, I said that I would go home and walked away. He ran after me and told me that he feels humiliated when I act like he doesn't know how to use technology (we are 10 years of age apart). 

Editor's Note: and... just as I was writing this, I realize that this behavior of mine - saying that the other person is slow in doing somethings - is the same one my mother, who's a narcissist, had with me, it's always been horrible so I understand his side now.

So my best friend has Aspergers. He’s very high functioning, but if you spend any significant time around him, you can tell he’s different. That’s never been an issue for me, and I consider him my brother. There have been periods where we’ve been each others only friend. He’s my main man. Hell we even live together. 

I say all of that because he views the world in his own unique way. Basically he can only view the world through his lens. He can not grasp that other people have thoughts and experiences outside of his own. Classic symptoms of his condition. This is pertinent to the story. 

So we’re the same age, late 20s. Neither of us has had a girlfriend before. But about 8 months ago he got one. Long story short, his girlfriend is the worst. Mentally abusive, controlling, manipulating, the whole nine yards. Ive tried to show him she’s not good for him, but if he’s happy, it’s none of my business. 

Now to the heart of the matter. Ever since he got into his relationship, he’s constantly asking me why I’m not in one. He’s always asking me about my tinder/bumble accounts. Every time we’re out he’s always pointing out girls, saying ask her out. I have social anxiety so I can’t just “ask her out”. 

To him, he got a girlfriend easily, so therefore EVERYONE can. Now I fully understand this is due to the way his mind works. But what he doesn’t understand is that he’s a very desirable dude. Tall, handsome, etc. he has an easier time doing these sorts of things. 

I’m beginning to get annoyed with his attitude and persistence in this matter. Like, just butt out dude. Everyone has their own path to walk, and mine is different than his. His never ending prying is starting to get in my nerves. I get he’s trying to help out, and I do truly appreciate it, but he just can’t understand my life is different than his. Am I the Asshole?"

So the story: My friend just graduated from college and got a job at a different state. I was /am very happy for him and I wanted to celebrate with him. I asked him to hang out and originally we were going to go fishing, but he had to stay late and we ended up meeting in the afternoon. After a few minutes we did a coin toss on who was driving and it was him. We went to the first bar and ate, then we moved to a second bar had a few beers and left to go to the 3rd bar. Here is where it gets stupid.

We stayed in this bar for a while. I kept buying drinks and everything was on me. I'm not gonna lie, I drank way more than I could handle, we met some dude and he started drinking with us and I remember was me smoking a cigarette with them. I then browned out..... and when I woke up in a car, the dude on the passenger seat and then my buddy on the driver seat. I thought everything was okay until I heard ""yes, officer."" I was stunned, I didn't know what to do. I was also very drunk at this moment and started throwing up... A lot. At this moment the dude in the passenger seat told the officer that I was very sick and he needed to get me out. the dude pulled me to the side of the street away from view( i think) and I proceeded to vomit everywhere.... I asked him about my friend and told him I did not want to leave. But he insisted and told me that if I stay I would just get him in more trouble and get in trouble myself. Me being drunk, I got scared and just went with him. The dude got his friend ( or maybe his girlfriend) to pick us up and told me that I should fill up her car since they were helping me get home and I did it, it would be the same price for an uber anyway.

I got home, I tried contacting his family but my phone died and it had throw up on it and I was not able to charge it due to moisture. I tried to instagram message his brother. I tried for an hour or so but I was so drunk I couldn't even log in to my instagram. I then passed out and I woke up sober, panicking that I FUCKING LET MY BEST FRIEND SLEEP IN JAIL. I then called the jail to pay his bail or get him out, but they informed me that he was going to be released in a few hours. His brother contacted me and I told him everything, I tried contacting him when he got out but he never picked up or responded.


Am I the asshole here for not planning ahead and leaving my friend because I thought it would be for the best?

Honestly, I am sorry, I should've been more responsible and I hope you're doing well bro. I understand that you don't want to talk to me anymore because I left and you should be angry because I left you and I shouldn't have done that.

I was asked by someone, who I happened to have, at least, engaged with some sexual experience to have his fantasy fulfilled. He is the CEO of an ad agency. I happened to be that hopeless grad of that field that couldn't land a job in the industry because of my lack of experience. He asked me if I can do a threesome with him. But I told him that I would only do it when he gets me a job in his agency. He was hesitant about it because he doubts that I lack the experience and maybe people will talk about how he got to know me. I used to work for him (his other company)  before but he laid me off due to downsizing. I am really desperate to have a career. I work in retail now and I hate every single day of it. He knows how bad I wanted to have a career, so I asked him that I would only do it when he agreed to my amendments. 

I don't think he will, though. I know this is wrong and there is a way that I could land a better position in the field given my degree and my internship experience. I send applications and I am trying so hard but no one wants to give me a chance. I don't know what to do at this point. I know he has the power to change my life but at the same time, I feel guilty of my actions because of desperation. If he agrees, would that make me an asshole? A whore? Just to be clear, I’m 24 and he’s 41. I have a degree in this field, I just can't get my foot in the door because my degree is back home and not here in states.

c7097o	2019-06-29 15:29:46	iseenyawithkieffa	AITA for not wanting to be friends with someone	"Hey all, Quick opinion needed! My friend and I are worried we're the assholes for not wanting to be friends with another work colleague

For a bit of context: Myself and my friend ( let's call him ￼B have been best friends for around 4 years now, we've been lucky enough to be on the same team at work and recently a few new people joined our teams, let's call him A

From the minute A joined our team he pretty much inserted himself into our group ( mainly me and B but a couple others too) We've heard a lot abou tA from other people, that he has a lot of unpopular opinions / is quite rude or blunt so the others in the group have nothing to do with him but we figured he surely couldn't be that bad so we wanted to give him a chance. We noticed pretty quickly that he would say things that are absolutely not ok ( be it politically, calling people mean names, and even being a little pro nazi) so we've always been like ""nah that's not cool"" whenever he's said something infront of us. But it became so intense that he would message us outside of work probably all day long spamming with links and things he found funny that weren't ok to us.

Now its gotten to the point where anything we do he wants to tag along and we feel bad that we just don't want to be his friend, the type of work environment we have require us to talk regularly with him and other members of the team. Think Office Space.

So the question is, are we both the asshole for not wanting to be friends with someone who has extreme views, and actively leaving him out from social things?

Ps, if anyone knows how to tell another adult that their views and the ways they express them makes it difficult to be friends with them, and we would prefer not to, without hurting their feelings would be great! Sorry for the little relationship-advice cross over."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c708yv	2019-06-29 15:29:07		WIBTA if I skipped a family function to be with my in-laws?	"So every year my family goes to this festival/picnic that only happens this one day a year and my grandparents love it, they get to see their grandkids (siblings and I) and their great grandkids (our kids) and its generally a family friendly place with rides and games and food. I've gone every year for the past five or six years and its become a sort of tradition for my family. To be honest, I don't really enjoy it but I go for my grandparents; its always hot and crowded, the rides are old and rickety, and my daughter is 2, so shes still too small for most of the rides and several hours of direct sunlight and 90 degree weather is going to be hard on her. I agreed to go this year and bought a ticket several weeks ago.

Now, my in-laws are amazing and we have a wonderful relationship, I spend time with them without my husband, we love each other and they're really good to us. This weekend they're going through a tough experience that is necessary but will be emotionally painful for them. They invited us over on Sunday to spend time with them and I know the company would make things easier, particularly having my daughter there to love on and coddle. They've been through hard times lately and I want to be there for them, they deserve the support and I want to make them feel better if I can.

I'd really rather go see my in-laws, they're such good people, I hate to think of them hurting. I know it's never cool to bail on plans that were made well in advance, but there's more going on here than just not wanting to go and I feel like it's fair that I want to support my in-laws, they're my family too and they deserve my support. Also, recently there's been some issues in my family with our grandparents respecting the boundaries my siblings and I set about our kids, trust was broken and i'm just generally still kind of upset with them. That being said, I take my daughter to visit them pretty often and even with the issues going on I've kept up the visits, we went to see them last Sunday and will again within a week or two, regardless of whether I attend the picnic. I would in no way be skipping the picnic to hurt them, we've been close my whole life and aside from the problem recently I have a really good relationship with them, I don't want to hurt their feelings. When I called my grandma to explain the situation she basically told me she'd be really upset if my daughter isn't there because they don't get to see all their great grandkids at once very often (3-4 times a year) even though they see all of them regularly, just not together. I know this is important to them but my in-laws are important to me, and to be frank i'm still a bit mad about the way my grandma has dealt with things, mainly with guilt and refusal to acknowledge that she did anything wrong.

Yesterday, I started my new job as a delivery driver for Papa John's to keep me busy before I head back to university in September. I had the interview last week and the manager said that I would work a trial shift (singular) unpaid where I would be shown the ropes.

I came to work yesterday and it seemed like a fairly ordinary ""first day""; going over health and safety and customer etiquette etc and then I went for a ride with another driver. Bear in mind this was all within the first hour. Then I was told to start doing deliveries by myself (which I was perfectly happy with as I thought I would just be doing a couple and then going home). I started my deliveries at 4 and didn't finish until 12, when I then had to help clean the store with one other employee. By this point, pretty much everyone had gone home (there had previously been six other drivers and about the same in store staff).

I was then told my trial period would also include today, presumably working the same hours again unpaid.

When I got home, I was pretty pissed off as:
a) A trial shift is normally a couple of hours to get used to the work, I had worked a full shift like the other workers.
b) they hadn't told me it would be a full shift
c) If I was working the same shift again today then I would be missing out on 16 hours of pay which equates to about £120.
d) the store had just had an extra pair of hands helping them for nothing which seems pretty exploitative

I then texted my boss politely asking if the next shift would be unpaid (even though I already knew the answer) and that I felt that sixteen hours unpaid work is unfair when I'm doing literally the same job as the 5 other drivers.

I woke up this morning to a brief message off him telling me to come in ten minutes before I was due to start. When I turned up, he sat me down in the office and asked me to explain why it was unfair. His reasoning to not pay me was ""all the drivers have to do two unpaid shifts"" and ""you were slow on some of your deliveries"" and he then told me to go home and come back tomorrow.

I'm pretty pissed off to be honest lads, but I can't help feeling like I'm coming off as an entitled prick.

For the past 3 months, they have been continuously fighting multiple times and they're both pretty egoistic. I have never liked this girl because she's very immature at handling situations and does not think about the other person affected before saying or doing something. My friend for one, has strong feelings and I feel that it is clouding his judgement. He never told me about his relationship partly because I was tired of the fights and partly because he didn't want to.

3 weeks ago, he told me that she broke up with him and he sounded pretty depressed. Told me that she had been using him all this while and wasn't committed to the relationship at all. He also told me about how he would make all the sacrifices and she'd refuse to do the same. I made him block her on social media but he wouldn't delete her pictures with him no matter how many times I tell him. And he wouldn't let me text her saying what a piece of poop she was. We never spoke of her again, until yesterday.

She posted a picture of the qualities of her zodiac sign with a 100 emoji on it. It included qualities like intelligent, humorous, loves long relationships, passionate lover and similar phrases. I got triggered seeing the photo and I replied to it saying ""A compilation of all things that you aren't"". She tried to argue with me and I went full-on rant mode. Then my friend calls me after 3 hours shouting ""Why the fuck did you have to do that !"" he continues shouting at me for another 5 minutes and asks me to apologize saying that they're back together. I had no other option, so I texted her saying ""sorry for misinterpreting the situation, My bad"". I had to stand by my opinion and low-key apologize at the same time. He calls me crying an hour later and tells me that she doesn't want to talk to him anymore and he blames me for it.

The way I see it, she never really took him seriously and used me as an excuse to end it. But, Am I the Asshole ?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Update 1:

He called me a minute ago and told me that she thinks that he is giving me all the info about their relationship on a regular basis, but as  mentioned above he never does. He also told me that she asked him why he had given me so much space in his personal life. BECAUSE HE IS MY BEST FRIEND.  I don't feel very good about where this is going"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I really do love him like a son and in every other instance I feel I do my best to treat he and bio son equally. If this were “just” a vacation I’d bring him no issues.

But his mom (ex) cheated on me and emasculated me in pretty severe ways leading up to the divorce. I’m just not ready to discuss that with my family at large. 

This really sucks because without even asking me, my ex promised him that he was going with us. I have found out from her sister that the reason she probably did this is because she’s going on some red-neck rock cruise and needed child care and it just so happened to roughly coincide with my two week trip.

c6zycz	2019-06-29 15:03:22		AITA for not wanting to get a summer job?	"I'm a 17 year old who is going to be a senior in high school next school year. My parents want me to try and get a job this summer, but I would rather be spending the summer reading books and improving myself.

I'm interested in learning how to make profitable long-term investments in the stock market so that I can have a good financial future. If I spend the next 2 months at a job working, I'll probably be making $2000-2500, which really won't do much for me. If I learn how to make good investments now, I think it will be much more profitable in the long run since when I finish college and find a reasonably good paying job, I will have much more capital to work with and be more educated on making good investments.

My parents argue that getting a summer job is the right thing to do because it will give me work experience, which I do agree with. They also said that a job would give me a little bit of money to get my feet wet with investing, and learning from experience now will be better than spending all of my time reading books. My dad has had some success with the stock market himself, but when I asked him to tell me something that he's learned from experience that you can't learn from a book, he refused. I'm not exactly sure why he did that, but I'm not going to agree with an argument that someone refuses to back up. Even though work experience has value, I believe that investing skills that I learn now will be of even more value in the long run. If my parents are worried about me not having work experience, then in a few years I can try to get an internship somewhere once I decide what I want to do with my life.

I don't want to work and educate myself at the same time because I have the rest of my life to make money and I believe that I should be mastering skills while I still have free time.

As far as my finances go my parents have agreed to help me pay for part of college, and then I will take out loans to pay for the rest.

c6zyct	2019-06-29 15:03:22	BrightPark121	AITA For the way things went down while selling my Apple Watch	"So I put my old Apple Watch on Facebook marketplace and was trying to sell it to buy a newer one. I got a message a couple days later from a later who was interested. Only thing was that she was messaging me in Spanish and it was translating to English and came off being hard to read what she was writing (obviously I don’t know much Spanish). But we ended up finding a place to meet up and sell it. I was originally going to ask to meet half way because she lived about an hour away from me. But I just told her to meet me in the down right outside of hers and that’s where I sold it to her. A fear of mine was that she wasn’t going to know any English and only Spanish when we met but fortunately she spoke enough English for me to understand her. All she asked of me was to change the language of the watch to Spanish for her. 

Couple days later she messaged me on Facebook again telling me that the Apple Watch won’t connect to her phone because my info was still on it. Which didn’t make sense to me because I already wiped the Apple Watch clean of my data before selling it to her and unpairing it from my phone. She started messaging me saying things like “I gave you my money and trust you need to help me” so I ended up making the decision to drive the hour away and help her out, mostly because if my account info was still on the watch, I wanted to make sure it was off permanently. So I found out some things I didn’t do like remove it from find my iPhone, but after that, nothing of mine was still there. She was telling me that she couldn’t log into her Apple account on the watch because my account was still on it, but when I took a look at her phone, it was not my email and it was not hers either because she showed me what hers was. This isn’t really a knock on her but what made the situation much more difficult was that she could barely speak any English and her phone was all in Spanish as well, so my friend who was with me helped translate our conversation with her over the phone, which still came out as hard to understand. 

I tried everything I could to help her out but it was obvious that there wasn’t much I could do, and I tried explaining that to her, but she kept responding with, “no, you!” And pointing at me and I kept telling her it wasn’t my account and I couldn’t help her. So when I tried to give her back the watch, she instead wouldn’t take it and started walking back into her house. I told her to take the watch and she wouldn’t, so I left the watch on the fence of her house and left, later messaging her to tell her that I left it there and that I was sorry I couldn’t do anything for her. 

Mind you she never asked me for a refund, she just asked me to fix the watch.

She messaged me telling me police was on the way and such, and after that I blocked her on Facebook. 

Let me know what you guys think.

EDIT: Some things I’d also like to add:

The one thing that I fault myself on in this situation is that I didn’t remove the watch from find my iPhone before selling it to her, only erased my data and unpaired it to my phone. I’m not totally sure if that’s what caused the issue but I did remove it from find my iphone before meeting up with her, and messaged her to see if that’s what fixed the issue, and she said no. And that’s when I made the drive over to try and help her.
Also, I mentioned that on her phone, it didn’t show my email, neither was I able to sign into my account to see if that will activate the removal from find my iPhone, how I know the email that was shown was not hers was because I went to the settings on her phone to see what email she had and it was a different one than the one that was shown on the Apple Watch activation screen. 
I’m assuming that maybe her husband or one of her kids used her email to help her sign in but I don’t know for sure. And I am thinking that she might not have known the password to her account, because when I first asked her if she knew her password, she said she didn’t, but then a couple minutes later wrote down a password for me to use to sign her in, which didn’t work."

c6zw41	2019-06-29 14:57:46	Tacoma-Andrew	AITA For Leaving My Father In Spain	"So, we are from the USA (WA and NJ) and we were going to Spain for my brothers wedding. My father and I (30M) decided to make a trip out of it so we would be there from June 16th - July 2nd; my brother's wedding time lasting for 4 days in the beginning of that time period. 

During the wedding there were several people in my SIL's family that came who were my age, both friends and family, while there were only 4 people for my brother, us being 2 of them. Every day during the 4 day wedding celebration my father made inappropriate comments. He would invite my brother's friend's gf to sit on his lap, told my SIL to ""shake it for me baby"", would shout ""wow look at that"" when referring to my SILs brother's gf, as well as make racist jokes like, ""look at that Jew fish"" when referring to an artist's street painting. These are only some of the examples but in his mind these were all either jokes or compliments although it left most people feeling uncomfortable; my brother and SIL, especially. 

My brother had a talk with him on the last night we were there and the next morning, when my father and I left to continue our vacation, I brought it up. I prefaced it and explained I dont want to fight but want to understand each other. He agreed but 5 minutes later he began yelling saying that's just the way he is, he doesnt need to be attacked, fuck you guys, I'm just an old man, there are plenty of things about you I dont like, take it or leave it, etc. 

I reacted the same way and raised my voice explaining that's not a good excuse, it isnt acceptable behavior, we love you and want you to be around but that wont happen if this misogynistic/racist behavior continues, etc.

Moreover, he didnt help plan this trip at all even after I asked him for help multiple times. He would respond with IDC thinking he is being easy but really it just put 100% of the work on me. It was very frustrating. All of this together left me with a very short fuse so we didnt talk much. Luckily my SILs family were also staying in Barcelona so we hooked up with them which cut the tension. The next morning I woke up and planned our entire trip. I get out of the shower to him on the phone trying to book a plane ticket back home that same day. 

I left to hang out with my SILs family, alone, as he was on hold with the airline. I received a text from him later that day saying it would be too expensive and he'd try to stay out of my hair as much as possible. I booked a plane ticket for 3 days later costing me about $700 and slept at my SILs fams place the remaining 3 nights. I paid for the Airbnb so he is able to stay there for free even though he insulted it to my SILs family in front of me.

So I kinda stopped talking to him completely. Then I got a pc and began gaming on that instead. Two years down the line one of my real friends recommended that we should play some rainbow six seige together. I stared the Xbox up after two years.

Yesterday I was at a drug store with my friend. We separated for 15 minutes and I saw these two younger boys, they looked like they're in high school (I'm in university). One of them seemed obviously gay, the other one not really. I noticed them because they came nearby to look at acne creams.

When a group of tourists passed, one guy kissed the other on the cheek very quickly. I saw that from the corner of my eye because I wasn't completely turned that way. It was still really shocking and exciting to me because I'd never seen something like that in public. Basically only in movies, TV shows, YouTube videos.

I glanced awkwardly, looked away, then glanced again because I thought maybe they'd do it one more time. But they felt me looking because I guess I wasn't subtle enough. They seemed embarrassed and ran away from there to the other side of the store.

She requested to meet for a meal at most near the interstate to see her niece and nephew (my kids). My kids have an excellent relationship with her. My GF was livid at this request. She feels that the Aunt is butting into our 10 day vacation by requesting an hour to see her nephews. When I realized my GF wasn’t on board I completely dismissed her opinion and will be letting the kids see their aunt. My GF and I are both veterans and should understand the value of having the opportunities to see family whenever possible when stationed far from home. I feel like my GF saw red during our whole discussion. I attempted to make an example of how I’d do it if we were to break up and it was her family who requested to see our daughter as I traveled. She responded that she wouldn’t do it as it’s no longer her family after a breakup and not her responsibility to make reunions happen. I’m completely beside myself on this one.

Every child is different.


Person 1: 3 months is to young for a baby to using this, it could cause future problems with their legs.


Me: how about a source on that because my son's pediatrician has absolutely no problem with his affinity for standing.


Pissed person: ""how bout a source on that"" lol how about we try for less attitude and play nicely and respect others opinions? It's good for the kids to see mommy play nice with others, give it a try instead of full-on biting people's heads off for NO legitimate reason and being snarky haha


Me: I didn't bite anyone's head off. I legitimately would have been interested in a source if it existed. I find it interesting that instead of providing facts, you are choosing to attack my character falsely. All I did is ask for a source, ma'am.


Pissed person: WOOOW you are acting like a manipulative snot hahaha subtly persisting that others are wrong by saying ""I would have been interested if a source actually existed"" translating to ""a source doesn't exist and your opinion is false"" (it's narcissisticly passive, but I caught it, doll lol hard to miss acutally) next, ""I'm attacking your character falsely"" lol that would be you taking complete offense to honesty and an outsider's observation and you chose to victimize yourself while being dramatic in the words you choose by using the word ""attack."" Your comments are drenched and drowning with attitude and disdain for every comment on here because it contradicts what you personally accept, and you are literally writing novels on here with arguments against others 😂😭🤣💀 my favorite part that speaks volumes of your character: you called me ""ma'am"" in a derogatory sense at an attempt to name-call. Sure, you could've used a curse or explicit, but to continue playing victim you called me an ""acceptable"" name. Girl there is help out there, manipulation is nothing to be ashamed of, twisting words around and taking ultimate offense to every syllable a disagreeing person has with you...it IS correctable and you are not alone❤❤ But unfortunately, I feel like instead of being enlightened to the ""legitimate facts"" and ""sourcing"" of your own words you will still choose to be blind to the fact that you really are manipulating this conversation to however you want it to be in your mind and you will still have oodles of attitude and do as you please. You have all the signs. I promise I'm done, LITERALLY can't get anywhere with people like you lol"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c6zjsg	2019-06-29 14:25:33	Sashandstuff	WIBTA if I ask my room mate to stop cuddling with my cat all night?	"A former coworker rents a room in the condo that I own. He’s a fine room mate and always pays rent on time and all that. I like that he also loves my cat and gives her a lot of attention. I’m fine with this, the more love she can get the better, but lately he has started to take her for entire nights. He always closes his room when he sleeps, of course, so once she’s in she can’t get out and come to her rightful parent who wants her company (okay yes i’m jealous too). 

I already find the situation annoying but the real kicker is that my room mate doesn’t have the best hygiene and whenever my cat sleeps in his bed she smells really, really musty. To the point where I need to put a blanket between her and my face if she does get to my room. 

I own the place so I can make sure he vacuums and airs the room out sometimes but he has to make the decision to wash his own bedding, and he doesn’t. He’s a really socially awkward and fragile dude but despite this he is a really great guy. 

I have no idea how to approach this without destroying him. Part of me thinks I should suck it up because i’m not going to renew his lease anyway and it’s four months away, but I don’t know if I can take it that long. It’s my dang cat.

Just woke up excuse my awful grammar and structure.

edit: Gotta add that this isn’t the reason i’m not renewing his lease. Im moving and going to rent the whole place out."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6zjgo	2019-06-29 14:24:40	rentingthrowaway12	AITA for deciding to rent a house with a friend instead of my past roommate?	"So this has been bothering me for a while because my old roommate and longtime friend has been upset and distant from me for this situation.

My roommate, Rick for this story, and I were looking for a place to rent for our next year of college. We got off to a pretty late start, starting to look seriously in March for this September. This was due to the fact that he originally planned on living at home, but I really wanted to live with him again and convinced him to find an apartment. He lives close by, but said he would have been miserable now that he thought about it living with his parents again.

 We found a few places, but the rent was going to be around $750 including utilities. Not horrible, but the timeline meant we couldn't sublease it easily, we had to pay for it during the summer when we wouldn't use it, and it was near the top of my budget, meaning groceries would be a bit challenging to get. Another friend, the one who I will be renting with now, offered to rent us each individual rooms in her house that was much nicer and it would be only $500 including utilities and it would be easier to access campus. 

Unfortunately, Rick would not accept that offer due to his GF being uncomfortable with him living with another girl in the same house(my friend offering the house is said girl). His GF has caused some issues in the past year due to her not being open to meeting some of his friends who were female and some trust issues between the two it seemed. Rick's GF is in high school still while he is a freshman. Originally I went along with him and said I would rent with him still, but after thinking it over, I decided in May to rent with my other friend in her house, with or without Rick. This has made him upset and reserved and he hasn't done anything with me for over a month.

 I felt bad and called to apologize since I feel like I left him out to dry, but I also think I can't pass up a good financial situation to stay with him and make his GF happy. Am I the asshole here? Some days I feel like it and other days I say fuck it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

&#x200B;

So my parents run a company in the countryside, and since I am their teenage son I obviously work for them in the summers. They are always trying to expand the company (they run a hostel type thing) and build new houses for guests to stay in. To save money, they don't hire workers to do the stuff they can do themselves, so they work a lot. I work 12 hour shifts, and so when I have days off I do stuff like chores at home, but apparently that's not enough. When I have days off they often ask me to do something with them at work like cleaning up at the building facilities and even help them with some construction stuff. The thing is: I wouldn't get paid for it. Sometimes I help them, most of the time I don't. They think I'm being a lazy asshole (they haven't said exactly that but something milder) and say that ""we own the company together, sometimes we have to work off hours without getting paid"". And sure, I am their son, but it's their company, not mine. So, AITA?

(note: I am fully prepared to be called TA, just please explain why so I can try to stop being one, thanks)

c6zfvw	2019-06-29 14:15:17	WynterQueen	WIBTA if I made meals my family doesn’t like?	"My family consist of my husband, and two sons, ages 14 and 11. I do almost all the cooking for the family. My husband will make dinner one night a week if I need him to due to work. That dinner is normally pasta or he will order pizza/take out. 

My husband on older son are picky eaters. My younger son is to a lesser extent. Husband doesn’t like eggs, beans, fish or shellfish, yogurt, sour cream, anything cream based, casseroles. Older son doesn’t like pasta, red sauce, most vegetables (exceptions are potatoes, corn, peas, mixed veggies). Younger son is not a big fan of red meat and fish that is not breaded and fried, and not a big fan of pizza. 

To complicate things, I am obese and joined WW to lose weight and improve my health. I’ve lost 40 pounds but still have a ways to go. Most of the foods on my zero point list are things someone in the family won’t eat. I’ve been making multiple meals to appease everyone but I’m tired of acting like a short order cook. 

WIBTA if I made a meals that I know some family members would not like? I would post a menu in the kitchen so everyone knew what was coming and they could plan to make themselves dinner if they didn’t like it. I do already try to get them involved in meal planning but the kids never participate, saying they don’t care or have any ideas. My husband participates but his ideas are usually really high point. I’ve been making a lot of chicken and they all complain about sprouting feathers. I’d like to incorporate things like fish and shrimp and meatless options more often but don’t because someone (or maybe all of them) wouldn’t even try it.

Edit: Wow! This got way more responses than I thought it would. Some additional info for those who have asked- I work a full time job that can be quite demanding. My kids can cook a little bit. They are completely capable of using the microwave and making soups or prepared chili on the stove top. My older son can heat things in the oven as well. I agree with the commenters that day I’ve spoiled them and I need to get them in the kitchen more. It will be good for them to have that knowledge when they become adults. My plan would be to have things I know they can prepare or put together at all times, so soups, chili, sandwich bread and fixings. I always make a big salad and hard boiled eggs in the fridge. Quick frozen meals. I am trying to move away from overly processed foods to homemade foods but I can freeze those meals or leftovers for that.

c6zboz	2019-06-29 14:04:51	IncredibleTeacherMan	WIBTA if I report a first aid instructor who I believe to be a bad teacher?	"Preface: I'm a teacher and therefore have a fairly thorough knowledge of teaching methods.

Today I went to a first aid course. Not run by the Red Cross, but my current employer sent me so I didn't get to choose. The teacher was an older fella, accountant for most of the week, who very much cares deeply about this work. He's been doing first aid courses in the area for years.

And though his book knowledge was good, his teaching was abysmal. A few examples:

Made fun of people for misunderstanding directions;

Prefaced a *lot* of sexist comments with ""not to be sexist, but..."". Made other sexist comments too, seemingly without realising it. Also ""randomly"" chose the young, pretty woman to be his patient around half the time. As a big fella with a beard, I was never called upon for some reason;

When teaching us the stable side position (renamed from the recovery position years ago - he still called it the recovery position) he had the whole class do what they thought was right first, had us stop and return to the line when we made a mistake, not tell us what the mistake was, and just move on down the line. All this before teaching us what it was for or why it was useful;

Spent at least a third of the time repeating information or adding personal anecdotes, or hectoring us to diet and exercise. Didn't really seem to have a timetabled structure for the class, which was an eight-hour day. If he had one, he didn't follow it;

Gave students the answers during the test. That young pretty woman did not get the knowledge at all, so he told her the answer then marked it correct;

Didn't even teach slings. Implied heavily that they were useless at first-aider level;

Told us we all passed the final assessment without taking it because we'd reached the end of the slated class time.

Probably others, but it's been a long day.

I noted in the course evaluation that his content knowledge was good and his teaching style was not. I obviously didn't put all these examples. 

The reason I'm pondering is this: his content knowledge *is* good. Nothing he said, even in the personal anecdotes, was wrong per se. I *did* learn. All but one person in the class I would trust to do first aid on me or anyone I love. He's done a whole lot of good in the community with this work, including bringing the price for businesses to buy 24/365 publically available defibrillators down by $300. The other people who took the class today travelled a long way to attend and I don't know if they would have the chance to resit these tests if it came to that. 

Will I be the asshole if I call the first aid company and lay this out? I feel the claims I would make are enough to have him investigated and possibly fired. Any tests he has administered or certificates he has given would be under suspicion, which will impact who knows how many people.

Edit: if anyone asks a question I'll have to get to it in the morning. I am a very tired man."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c6zae2	2019-06-29 14:01:44		AITA for removing a long term friend from my life?	"Hi AITA,

I need to know if I’m the asshole in this scenario because after speaking with a few friends I’m conflicted.

I was involved with someone who ended up emotionally abusing me to a point where I didn’t see the point in living anymore. This individual really got into my head and made me feel worthless, stupid and crazy. They gaslit me to no end and verbally threatened me face to face and by text so much that I’m actually very much afraid of them. 

We very recently went our separate ways and I’m mentally in a better place, but I have this mutual friend called V (who I’ve known for years) who’s grown fond of this individual. For whatever reason they speak on occasion and it’s happened that the abuser has asked about me to V, which needless to say makes me incredibly nervous and afraid. I’ve asked V not to tell this person ANYTHING about me and that I’m really upset they’re still “friends” but that I can’t tell V who to befriend. V knows my history with this individual but doesn’t seem to let it sway their decision on befriending this person.

I’ve been made aware that they on occasion still discuss my personal life and I feel like my boundaries are being crossed. I am planning to remove this friend from my life completely but other closer friends have said that it’s a bit ridiculous and that I’m trying to control who V is friends with or not, to just ignore them and move on. Despite this, V claims they aren’t close, but I have no trust in anyone.

Am I the asshole for separating myself from an old friend because they’re still in contact with this individual even if it’s very limited contact, or am I being dramatic?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c6z9qb	2019-06-29 13:59:56		AITA for asking my girlfriend to stay in an airbnb while my sister visits?	"My GF (22f) and I (26m) have been long distance from the beginning of our relationship. We met while she was travelling and have managed to make it work even though I'm in Germany (I come from England) and she's in the US. We've been together for about a year and a half so far. She wrote a post about this situation from her POV and I wanted to see if it would get the same response if I wrote it.  
 

You can find her post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c6mg1s/aita\_for\_being\_upset\_that\_my\_boyfriend\_wants\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c6mg1s/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_boyfriend_wants_to/)   
 

So she's coming to visit me soon here in Germany and staying for around 5/6 weeks. Before she booked to come here I had a trip already arranged with my sister (23f) cousin (27m) and his wife (27f) to come and visit me for 3 nights. My cousin and his wife have a hotel booked together and I said to my sister she could stay with me, as nothing was arranged with my GF at this point. Their trip will be around 2 weeks into my GF being here. The issue is that we would all have to sleep in the same room as I live in a flat share with 3 friends. This wouldn't be ideal as my sister and GF barely know each other and it would make things awkward  (My GF was happy to try all of us in one room).

&#x200B;

As I rarely get to hang out with my sister anymore seen as we live in different countries I asked my GF if its okay if she stays in an airbnb as I already promised my sister she could stay with me - obviously I would pay for it. The reason being is that she can meet my flatmates, hang out, we can catch up on everything when we're not with the others and she also gets more of an insight into my life living here. During the weekend I was planning on my GF and family all to hang out, so they could get to know each other and we could see the city, go on a small day trip, get dinner, go to bars etc... I was trying to make it so my GF wouldn't be left out or feeling lonely as I know she will be upset at having to stay in an airbnb.

&#x200B;

I love my GF a lot and can't wait for her to come and visit me as well as meet my family. I understand that she feels hurt about the situation but I know we will get time together as she'll be here for 5/6 weeks and we have a couple of trips booked to go away to see some other countries in Europe. Overall,  I feel like I'm stuck where I doomed to make one party upset no matter what decision I choose.  

&#x200B;

So AITA for asking my GF to stay in an airbnb for a few nights? I'm genuinely interested to see if I'm being an asshole or if its more down to circumstance."		1	0

"Pretty self explanatory, my (f,25) boyfriend (m,28) and I had an argument this morning, because I got angry at him being on the phone so much. He intermittently sits and checks Instagram, fb, emails and WhatsApp’s all day. This doesn’t overly bother me as I use social media too, but not as much as him.
 
What pissed me off today was that we were at mine, mid conversation and his phone rang, his boss who we had just left an hour ago. He stopped talking and picked up the phone and I could hear him laughing and joking on the phone, so it wasn’t serious. Bear in mind he’s not working and it’s the weekend. He’s done this a few times now, mid convo with me, if we are home or out shopping together, in the car even (handsfree) he’ll just answer his phone and stop our convo dead while I wait for him to finish. 

His argument as that it’s often family and could be an emergency, which I understand, but his family call all of the time to just chat, catch up etc, which means at least 2-3 x a day, wherever we are. I’m not saying he can’t answer his phone, but it makes me mad when we are out together and he has a full blown convo. I wish he’d just see if they are ok, and see if he can call back when we are less busy like when we get home.

I quickly learned that she was ridiculously clingy after she started texting me every hour down to the minute. I let it go for the first couple of days because I figured hey, it was her first time dating another girl, maybe she was just excited. It continued through the entire week. I really wanted out of the relationship by the fourth day, but by then she’d told me about what she’d been through and how it had seriously mentally scarred her and destroyed her self esteem. I’m not gonna go into the details because I don’t feel like it’s my place to do that, but she legit had a top ten tragic anime backstories type of past. Despite the fact that she could’ve hurt herself if I broke up with her, I did. Not because of her past, but because she seemed borderline obsessed and honestly that wasn’t healthy for either of us. She did offer to change herself repeatedly, but I kept on insisting that she shouldn’t have to change for a romantic partner. I don’t think she’s hurt herself over this. Not physically anyways, but the possibility was definitely there. That being said, am I the asshole for leaving her so quickly? Or should I have waited longer?	No A-holes here	1	0

Anyways my older brother (25) moved back in 6 months ago and has to share a room with me(17F). He claimed he’d find a job when he moved back in and wouldn’t cause trouble like he had in the past few years,but he didn’t keep his promise and completely messed everything up within the 6 months of staying here. He’s kept expensive plates and bowls in his room filled with moldy food and maggots to the point my mother and I had to replace a whole set of them,his part of the room is so messy that it’s spilling over into my room to which I get in trouble for. He has taken my laptop and made every key sticky,broke the track pad,somehow got it to smell like old moldy food,and on top of that takes it to the bathroom with him after I’ve repeatedly told him no.(he doesn’t wash his hands which I’m pretty sure is how I got sick the day after I got to use it) He used my power up rewards card without my permission and is expecting me to pay for “his game” and that he requires access to my switch whenever and wherever he wants. What finally set me over my limit is when he let his boyfriend who we’ve only known for THREE MONTHS stay in my room and say “moms okay with it because she didn’t say anything.” I on the other hand was not okay with it since I barely even know him and on top of that he’s just as bad as my brother about leaving food everywhere and using my stuff without permission and I found it weird for a 17 year old to share a room with TWO 25 year olds. So last night I finally got my mom to kick them out (though it took forever because she kept trying to persuade me to let them stay)after 6 months of dealing with my brothers crap and the fact he thought it was okay for a stranger to stay was just too much for me,a 17 year old to handle.

I know this is short and barely has context but if I list everything else my brother has done to me,my little bro,his grandmother and his ex he’d have the police called on him and I don’t want that.

Update:he’s allowed to stay but his friend isn’t I’m no longer on speaking terms with him because of how much I always have to sacrifice when he moves back in. My parents put a “wall” in my room and didn’t give me a chance to grab the stuff he took from me other than my laptop which is damaged(the wall by the way is a piece of plywood that’s very easy to break) and he now has to access his side of the room via the laundry room. My mom is also paying for the game he took from me on MY account and threatened to cancel MY account (I paid for the account so she can’t really do that) if I cancel the preorder.

All my life until my barber retired my senior year of high school, I got my hair cut at a small, white barbershop. I had seen a bunch of my friends at my school with really nice fade haircuts and found out they were going to a black barbershop in town. I decided to give it a shot. 

My first visit there definitely was a shock. There is a huge cultural difference between the way the barbershops are run - the old white guys compared to the young black guys. Needless to say, I loved my haircuts so I started going regularly. I’d just show up and get the first chair. 

That was until I met my current barber (a customer) at my former job. He ran the shop and had a lot more experience than everyone else. He told me he’d take me by appointment and we even scheduled my first appointment at my job.

I’ve gone to him for about a year and a half now, $40 each time for hair and beard. The appointments have never really been too punctual on his side, but recently he’s started being terrible with time. The last 5 appointments have all been over an hour of me waiting. I work overtime and go to school during the school year so I honestly have little time.

This last haircut was an hour and a half worth of waiting. He set the time for the appointment. I was his last head for the night. The whole time he seemed irritated. He was quiet the whole time and pretty rough with how he moved me around. He even told me that my hair was “fucked up” from waiting for so long to get a haircut, even though I told him that I couldn’t get in every time I tried. I got home and after showering noticed he did a bad time blending the one side of my hair. 

I’m a white guy in a black barbershop, so I don’t know everything. It’s my understanding that appointments are never punctual in one, but I feel that this might just be too long. 

Is my barber the asshole or AITA?

Tl;dr I’m a white guy getting my hair cut in a black barbershop. Recently, I’ve had to wait over an hour past each appointment time before getting cut.

c6z4z7	2019-06-29 13:47:02	alt-smoker	AITA for manipulating my mom to stop smoking	"So a bit of context:

About 3 years ago, my mom decided to quit smoking, mostly due to me and wanting to live healthy. For the first couple months she really struggled, sometimes sneaking a smoke. She was then reliant on nicotine gum for the first year, then quit completely. I was so proud of her and happy. 

Today however, I caught her smoking a cigarette. I was super upset, and confronted her. I had a bit of a meltdown and cried. She obviously felt bad, but wasn’t really doing anything or promising not to smoke. So, in order to keep her from smoking, I decided to sort of up my game. I will not make eye contact with her and am guilting her as much as I can. I am manipulating her to the point where she almost didn’t go out for the day. 

I kind of feel like this is some sort of manipulation. Also, just so it’s clear, I really am upset and really do want her to stop smoking. She has offered to do things for me, and I have denied it.

c6z4eb	2019-06-29 13:45:28		AITA for being offended over age affecting friendship	"Throw away. 

For about a year, I (F) have had a platonic work friendship with Ben, a sales rep with a marketing company my business uses. Ben has regularly contacted me and dropped in to see me at the office at least once a week. He has met my spouse Dave several times. We all worked a weekend event together. Dave and I invited Ben to our house with his girlfriend for a barbecue sometime. While we aren't close friends, we are definitely on friend terms. A couple of months ago during one of his drop-in visits, I showed him a paper and he made a joke about needing stronger reading glasses. I said in passing, ""It's funny, I don't need reading glasses yet."" Ben replied, ""Well, I'm 44."" I laughed and said, ""I'm older than you, I just turned 50."" Now, most people think I'm in my mid-thirties. Dave is 35 and looks a little older than I do. But Ben's reaction was way over the top. He looked in shock, stammered, said he thought I was younger than Dave. I told him no, I'm 15 years older than Dave. It was awkward because it went on too long. Finally he laughed and said something like 'Can I have some of your genes?' and left. After that day he has not stopped in at the office once. I did not hear from at all for 3 weeks, and since have received three emails from him for unavoidable marketing things. My responses have been curt and short. We weren't close friends, so it's not the fading of friendship that bothers me. What bothers me is the sense that finding out I'm 50 flipped a switch and he dropped the buddy act. I'm a little offended, so I'm being cold and unfriendly back. But maybe I'm making an assumption based on his reaction and abrupt change in behavior. AITA for treating him differently in response to this confusing turn of events, and for secretly being offended?"		1	0
c6z3hv	2019-06-29 13:43:06	Keep_Smiling97	AITA for not pursuing a job I dislike due to the client?	"So a little bit of background, I’m currently 22 and just had some major life changes like getting married and moving states to be with my husbands huge loving family. I have  experience working with kids on the autism spectrum since I was 16 but really wanted to go more into the mental health field and stray away from that. Since I’ve moved from a very hectic and chaotic family(which contributed to me growing up with depression & severe anxiety) I’ve vowed to go into a life I’m really happy in and do not want to be unhappy starting fresh. Now, onto the possible A-hole part. 
My husband’s aunt works for a company that owns group homes for all kinds of disabled people. Ranging from autism to mental illness & traumatic brain injuries. The company is great and has wonderful benefits and I was hired right away. But, even though I specifically asked to be put in a mental health home, I was put with an autistic client with extremely high behaviors. My first day was yesterday and I went home in tears. I’ll spare you details but the client was a hitter and a good foot and a half taller than me. As soon as I got home I sent my supervisor what I thought was a very respectful text stating I just didn’t think that house was a good fit for me and that I would like to still be employed with the company but with a better fitting house as I would not be happy in that one. She replied only with “oh wow... okay then...”. I immediately thought that was a horrible and rude response when I was being respectful. But maybe I wasn’t respectful? She eventually said “well finish your week of shifts since it’s hard enough to find people to cover”

c6yyo6	2019-06-29 13:29:39		WIBTA If I told my future team that my cousin who's applied for a job with us is extremely annoying?	"I am going to be joining work on Monday and was hired post a trial period for a job in a team of say max 15 people. I completed my trial period with them last year, and have since become extremely close friends with many of the people including the more senior people (I took a short break before joining to complete a qualifying exam).

This cousin of mine applied for a job there and he says that a few of the people have stated that they'll endorse him. Now this guy isn't a bad person, but he's just really really REALLY annoying, is generally not that smart but thinks he is, has terrible memory in a job that a lot of factual data, is juvenile, gossips, and is generally cringe. It's not just me, most of my friends who know him (we grew up in the same neighborhood as kids) think he's annoying af. He thinks saying things like ""hahaha he looks like a orangutan"" about a senior he's barely worked with is funny, thinks he's a part of the ""circle"" immediately and is generally super condescending. 

He asked me if I could put in a word for him and I bluntly told him I wouldn't stating I barely know them myself (which is partly true as I don't know the people who he referred to). Now I really cannot imagine myself working with him, or even being around him for extended periods. 

Would I be the asshole if I told my colleagues without them asking that he's annoying? Of course I won't tell everyone, but the ones I know only. We are probably only second cousins so I don't owe him any sort of family loyalty either but I think he sort of trusts me; even if not for help, I don't think he'd think I'd sabotage him. Only I don't think of it as sabotage, but that I'll be doing a good deed for myself anf others."		1	0

c6yx72	2019-06-29 13:25:26		AITA for refusing to go to my aunts house unless she has her dogs out of the house.	"First thing, this is a throwaway account because my dad uses Reddit and he might tell his sister. 

In my childhood my dad left my mom and while there was a time that he wasn’t in the picture, he came back into my life around 6th grade. In 1st grade I was attacked by a neighbors pit bull and have been afraid of dogs ever since.

My dad now has custody of me and my siblings during the summer and during this time he likes to take me to his relatives so we catch up on lost time, 

One of his sisters has three very huge dogs that pretty much scare me to no end. I have repeatedly made this clear by telling her that dogs scare me, about the pit bull attack, and refusing to anywhere near the dogs when I visit. 

She also brushes this saying that the dogs are friendly and that they wouldn’t hurt me. Which I understand but last year one of the dogs jumped on me and nothing about how friendly he was could have calmed me down.

This year that took me back to the same aunt and I did something rather childish of me but when we got there I refused to leave the car unless the dogs were outside in the fenced backyard. If this aunt wanted what could possibly be her only chance her niece she could do that or meet by the car. My did let her dogs out and I went inside. 

AITA? I was basically taking my aunts time with me hostage because of my fear but I have made very clear how much I fear dogs and nothing she said could help me with this fear."		1	0

c6yw5i	2019-06-29 13:22:28	Griffonomer	WIBTA if I set up a trust fund for my daughter but not for my sons?	"  My husband and I have three children: Anna (24), Jeff (21) and Jed (19). I adopted Anna a year after I got married. To avoid issues with my husband’s family, only I adopted her and my husband did not. Jeff and Jed are our biological children. The three of them are close and get along very well.

My husband comes from a well-off family, and a few months ago when his father died, he left trust funds amounting to, let’s say, $100K for each of his biological grandchildren (including Jeff and Jed) and $20K for Anna that they can access when they turn 30. It’s my FIL’s choice what to do with his money and I’m just grateful for the gift he gave my daughter, but I also feel for her because she has a smaller nest egg compared to her brothers. I talked to my husband if we could set up a trust fund for Anna using our own money to help close the difference, but he said he is not sure if it’s the right thing to do. 

To make it clear, my husband is Anna’s father in every way except on paper. He loves her and has never treated her differently than our sons. However, he is concerned that Jeff and Jed might see this as us favoring Anna. I was planning to talk to our children about it so they would know, but my husband said that it didn’t matter if we told them tomorrow or if they find out when they’re 30, the point was that we still did not treat them equally. He said that his father’s relationship with his grandchildren is his own, and our relationship with our children is our own. He thinks we should not try to ‘make up’ for his father’s decision to leave a smaller inheritance to Anna at the cost of possibly making our sons feel that we favor their sister.

I love all my children equally, but at the same time, I worry less for Jeff and Jed because they already have a comfortable amount of money from their grandfather’s trusts. I only want my daughter’s future to be as secured as her brothers’."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"I am in my early 20's. Life is super busy for me right now. I work 12 hour days (not complaining, I make great money for a kid my age) and have school at night. I live with my parents, and my father drives me to and from work because we both work in the same city. Lately, they've been asking me to pay them for what I think are the smallest things. Yesterday, I took my mother's car to the supermarket to grab something and she said I should pay her $5 for gas. The market is 3 miles away from our house so I saw no reason to.  I've done a lot of similiar things. I've always felt like it was never a big deal and they shouldn't worry so much. Today I left my company car keys at home. I can't get to work without them. I asked my father if he could get them for me and he said yes, but only if I paid him a $100 because I was taking away a lot of his morning. I waited to reply until he brought them to me then said no, I won't be paying you a $100 for doing me a favor. Now, both my parents are ganging up on me saying how ungrateful I always am. I really don't know if IATA or not. They've been saying constantly how ungrateful I act when they do stuff for me. I tell them that you shouldn't ask for things in return when doing service and that I would do the same things as they do if they'd ask. My mother especially constantly says how she feels like she's being used because I'm always taking and never returning. They say I am lacking major social skills, but I honestly don't see it.

Consequently I started making silly mistakes and got to hear for that. Over the period of one year, I lost all my confidence with magnitude of mistakes increased, so one fine day I came to office and resigned. With no other job offer in hand I'm now dependent on my husband.

c6yqln	2019-06-29 13:06:20	Nica-sauce-rex	WIBTA If I donate my neighbor's clothes to a homeless shelter?	"I live in an apartment with a shared laundry. I share it with four other apartments. They all are in a house across the street. I live in a single studio on the other side of the road. The laundry is in a very small shed (enough room for the washer and dryer and one person to stand inside) behind their building. I pay monthly for the use of this laundry. 

&#x200B;

Because I live across the street, laundry day is kind of a pain in the ass. Especially if it's raining. Somehow in a year living here, I've never chanced to meet any of the people I share the laundry with, but I've kind of gotten to know them based on the basket/ soap or whatever is in the laundry when they are using it. Big blue basket is the neighbor this post is about. As a side note, the house across the street has 12 apartments. My landlord told me four of them use the laundry so I have no clue who it actually is that I am sharing the washer with. 

&#x200B;

Big Blue Basket does a ton of laundry. It's in there frequently when I go to wash my clothes. Whoever they are, they do HUGE loads of laundry, like break-the-machine size, every time and they NEVER pick up their damn clothes. Almost every time I go to do my wash, they have clothes sitting dry in the the dryer and a wet load in the washer. I move their dry clothes out, on top of the dryer and move their wet clothes into dry and then start my laundry. One day they left some bedding in there, which I moved up to our tiny shelf (our landlord recently had the shelf installed so people could leave their soap etc in there) and it's been sitting up there occupying the whole shelf for almost a month. It's so god damned annoying. On top of that their huge blue laundry basket takes up the entire floor of the tiny room so I practically have to stand outside the door to load the clothes. 

&#x200B;

I went to do my laundry this morning and once again, they have two gigantic loads taking up the whole room, smelling mildewy so I know it's been there for a while. I can't go to the landlord about this. She's a 90 year old woman. She won't be able to help. There's a major homeless problem in our city and there's a shelter right down the street. I really want to gather up all of that clothing and bedding and drop it at the shelter. The bedding, like I said, has been in there for a month. Clearly, it's an extra set and now they're using our shared space as a storage area for their shit. I am sure someone would love to have that blanket and all of the clothes that have been abandoned in there for days.

Except no, he expects $5000 just like what my daughter got and I think that’s ridiculous. I’m not paying $2500 just to get him a damn car that’s too much. So I told him you gotta discuss this with your father because I’m not comfortable paying that much. His father doesn’t see the problem with the $5000 because he thinks it’s fair and I said it’s not. I only paid $800 for my daughters car because I had people helping and I’m not about to pay more than double what I did for her. I said he either takes what I offer or he goes asking his family for help too.

So last night i had a party with my group of animators for the scouts (idk how we spell that, i'm not an english native).

&#x200B;

I kept the bar and made the orders, we didn't had that much customers this day, so we drank, my ""friends"" and i.

&#x200B;

As the conversation continued, i felt like i was being mocked at, as usual, bcs i'm kind of a strange guy, i'm buff but super friendly and i do my best not to make drama so i let them play me as a fool, i really want to be a good member and be as productive as possible.

&#x200B;

So i got to the toilet, and i did my business, and they locked the door, haha, very funny, now i have to go though the window, i mean it's not really high but it's still anoying and i land correctly only because i'm kinda athletic, it was the second time this week they did this.

""but it's just a joke, you should stop drinking, u know how you are when you drink""

""here we go again..."" (bcs i said no)

&#x200B;

they would make fun of everything i said in the past when i was drunk, for MONTHS, while i was standing there, trying to laugh with them.

&#x200B;

i was REALLY pissed, and i wanted to destroy them all, you could feel they saw that in my eyes, there was a silence when i walked toward them.

&#x200B;

I grabed the dude by the arm and looked him straight in the eyes ""go f\*ck yourself, all of you, i'm not coming back ever, and you'll do without my help from now on"". i had my right arm shaking , it wanted so much to grab his neck, but i just left.

He didn't tried to struggle or fight back while i was constricting his arm, he knew i would do FAR worse to him if he even tried, i told you, i'm way more muscular and also faster than my entire group.

&#x200B;

So i left and i received messages from my female partner, asking why i got so upset (they weren't there when it happened, they chatted outside).

&#x200B;

""they are just joking, it is friendly, if you wanted them to stop u just had to tell them"" i mean she's not wrong but a healthy adult just don't make fun of someone in front of them as a ""joke"" for months.

&#x200B;

She ask me to consider coming back and says that my actions clearly calmed them and they aren't going to annoy me anymore.

&#x200B;

Am i the asshole there ? Overeaction or deserved ?

TL;DR : group made fun of me for months , i lost it and left them the same night after ""agressing"" the dude."		1	0

"My fiancé(29M) has a work friend named Sarah(28F) who has been receiving advice about how to get into intimate relationships and sex from him. They aren’t sexually involved etc but my fiancé despite my requests does not stop bringing up her sex life to me and does so because “It’s funny and awkward so you should suffer too!” 
I only hear about her sex life and nothing else, so I’m not interested and have told my fiancé I feel uncomfortable being told about her sex life and would prefer my fiancé stop because it might not be the best thing to discuss at work so often. 

I appreciate that he involved me and would tell me what they talk about. However it has bled into my personal life and is preventing me from having meaningful discussions about our relationship or our sex life because he will bring up Sarah. The final straw was him suggesting we have a 3some with Sarah because she had recently done new things in her sex life etc and will list them out and tell me if I wanted he can get pictures of her body and how she’s been wanting to have sex with us. I told him that made me uncomfortable and I don’t find her attractive in that way, yet he continued after I told him I was upset that he wasn’t taking me seriously and would joke about her to me like that. I’ve set boundaries and felt like he hadn’t respected them. He told me I was overreacting to a bad joke, and that he thought I’d just go along and insult her.
He and Sarah have come and apologized to me and her explanation was that her work friends are her only friends and they were all men in relationships so she got advice because this is her sexual awakening and women are jealous and not understanding like guys. She told me she felt bad she made me feel insecure since I’m included in their conversations despite me not talking about it. I was confused since I’m only concerned with why they discuss that at work. I don’t feel threatened I just want to be excluded as she’s his friend from work. 
My fiancé on the other hand told me I shouldn’t be dramatic about him asking me to follow rules on what not to say for talking to Sarah and that it’s normal to talk about sex at work for him but he has made it clear I can’t discuss sex even with friends because it embarrasses him. My fiancé said he apologized because Sarah told him I was right after he “shit talked me” to her because I told them “no more sex talk.”

c6yhoc	2019-06-29 12:40:15		WIBTA if I shot my neighbor's cat with a water gun?	"WIBTA?

Obligatory from a throwaway, because I feel like I could upset some people with this one. I've been having this issue for the last 3 months, and it's getting pretty bad.

I live in a small town, in a pretty rural area. I have 2 neighbors, an older couple/""OC"", and a lady who we'll call ""cat lady/CL"" from now on. Cat Lady has a ton of cats, I can easily identify 10 different ones right now, but I'm positive that there's more. They're (or some) not fixed, and there's kittens being born pretty often. 

My lot does not have a fence, and I have a pretty big yard, I've got no problem with OC's dogs coming into my yard, and playing with my dog, or CL's cats venturing through (I have no fence, animals dgaf). I've lived in my home for 4 years and while I'm not besties with my neighbors, but we all get along well enough. Since the spring, one of CL's cats had decided that my yard is the place to be. It started off just laying in the lawn, and being skittish. I'd see it occasionally, but now it's in my lawn all day, everyday. 

The cat has been using all of my flowerbeds as a litter box (and any patch that doesn't have grass). When I let my dog out, the cat will attack my dog (small breed), and then run back to its owners house across a very busy road (and I'm worried that they're going to get hit by a vehicle). It's constantly getting into fights with other cats, so outside is turning into a permanent banshee screech. It will get into fights with my cat through our screen door (I have an indoor cat), and through our basement windows, it's torn my screens all to shit because of this. 

The WORST is that now it's decided to start marking its territory, everywhere (car, deck, flowerpots), but especially my doors and windows. Basically anywhere it's seen my cat, it's started spraying my house, causing the smell to come inside. I'm literally outside every single day with a scrubber and cleaners, because my house stinks like cat piss. We're in the middle of a heat wave, so the smell is disgusting, and it's been drying/crystallizing wherever the cat has sprayed.

I've talked to CL about it, and she says that her cats are just strays that she feeds, and she has no control over them (even though I've seen them being let in and out of her house). We don't have any kind of animal control here, and I've contacted the only animal rescue type group that says they're so overloaded with cats that there's nothing they can do to help. 

I feel like an asshole, but the only way I can think to deter it is using some kind of super soaker water gun to spray the fuck out of it, until it gets the hint. I mentioned it to my friends, but they said I'd be TA for doing it. I'm at my wit's end, living in a cat pissy house, WIBTA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
c6yfyz	2019-06-29 12:35:06	chickenugh	AITA for getting my housemate's boyfriend to move his car?	"Hey guys, mobile user here. I apologize for the formatting.

So, for the sake of this story, we will be referring to my housemate as ""HM"", her boyfriend as ""HB"" and my boyfriend/other housemate as ""BF"".

HM, BF and I live in a two story home with two other housemates. None of us had cars when we moved in, but, around a month or two ago, BF got a car.

We have one parking spot for our home, so we obviously decided that it belongs to BF now. BF and I politely asked that anyone who brings visitors who own cars over that they park up in a parking lot that's about a 3 minute walk from the house.

In comes a little situation. Every single time that HM has brought HB over, if BF is at work, HB will ALWAYS park in the parking spot, even though we have asked him multiple times not to.

Just last night HB came over and parked in BF's spot around the time that he was coming home. I called him to let him know that, once again, he will have to park at the parking lot a few minutes down the street and he was pissed. The first few times he had to park up the street he didn't care, but it seems disrespectful to him at this point for HB to continuously park in BF's spot when we continuously tell him not to. BF always comes home between 7:00-7:30, HM knows this.

BF asked me (over the phone) if I could knock on HM's door and ask them for HB to move his car. So I did.

No answer the first time, so I knocked again, because BF asked me to.

Still no answer, so I kept knocking. They were probably in there having sex at this point, as that's the only thing that they seem to do when they're in this house, but I was annoyed and BF was annoyed. They couldn't at least say ""Hold on."" or ""We're busy right now."" ? Maybe I'm in the wrong for still knocking, but HB knows not to park in our house's parking spot.

Finally, HM comes to the door and I asked ""Can HB please move his car? BF is off work."" . HM was visibly annoyed, and she said ""He'll be down in one minute."" with a very annoyed, forced ""you could have not bothered us"" smile.

Over 5 minutes later, they still hadn't come down and BF was getting progressively more frustrated. I went back upstairs and kept knocking here and there until HB finally came out. After HB had left, HM came down a few minutes later with a bag/probably leaving to go to his place. They both seemed upset.

I could see me being the asshole for knocking when they were probably having sex, but we have asked multiple times for them to not use the parking space. BF pays rent, HB does not, so my logic here is that BF reserves the right to the spot until someone else in the house gets a car, or whenever our landlord comes over.

c6ydql	2019-06-29 12:28:09		AITA for telling roleplay partners my concerns?	"So, I joined a fun meme roleplaying group on Discord in May. I made my character, put myself out there and everything went good for a while. 

I interacted with a few people, and these people became regular rp partners as time went on. We talked out of character, and it seemed we got on well and was becoming friends. 

However, roleplay threads seemed to die with partner #1 soon after they were started. This went on for about a week or two. They said they lost motivation for the character, which we understood.  They decided to leave for a little bit. 

We had a catfish situation in the group, and when that was resolved, partner #1 came back, saying the person who was catfishing, was the reason they left. (Harrassing anons, constant questions, etc). 

We moved on, and things were okay again. But it happened again. Threads seemed to die, replies were overlooked. Partner #2 joined us, she and partner #1’s characters would interact with each other daily, give out replies to each other one after another. But when it came down to me wanting to interact with either of the two, they could barely get back to me, when they did the threads died, but a roleplay with partner #2 would go on all night. 

This went on for a month, and I didn’t say anything, even though I felt excluded by these people. 

I would hear things from partner #2 like: “They’re stressed about midterms right now”. “They have family issues.” 

On Monday, I couldn’t take it anymore and had to say something to them. They both agreed on making a discord group chat to discuss communication. 

My best friend who at this time, recently joined us, gave her opinion on the matter, and tried to make them see that I was a little upset because I felt like they were leaving me out. I told them that I would like to turn over a new leaf and start afresh, that I understood people got busy, and made a point i didnt have an issue with any of them, I just wanted to sort this situation out. 

My friend said we were all kind of horrible to each other and we should all apologise. Which we did. 

Partner #1 said they didn’t know what was expected of them, apart from clear communication (which wasn’t happening). But said they would try to be more proactive. Partner #2 couldn’t handle this because she has anxiety. Anyway, they both said they would improve from that point on. 

Until it happened again ten hours later. 

My best friend lost her temper with them and left the group. I confronted them with my full feelings on what had been going on for a month. I was met with: “I want you to respect the way I roleplay”, and blaming me for my friend losing her temper. I told them respect goes both ways. 

After they finished playing the blame game, they said “I’m glad this is resolved.” That was that. 

This is kind of bothering me (I know it shouldn’t). I want to see what other people think."		1	0

c6yc8u	2019-06-29 12:23:31	alwayernomore	WIBTA if I tell my boyfriend that I don’t want us to be in the same professional field because his accomplishments make me feel insecure?	"My boyfriend and I have been dating for three years. He’s kind, thoughtful, fun to be with and very intelligent, in the lazy genius kind of way. In college we took a bunch of classes together, and while I spent hours upon hours studying to eventually get a 3.9 GPA, he played video games and watched Netflix. His GPA was 3.8.

I was proud that he could get that GPA without even studying, but at the same time, part of me felt disheartened that I spent so much effort to achieve something that he was able to achieve almost effortlessly. This continued when we started reviewing for the LSAT. He got great scores for his initial tests, while I got not so great scores. I was honestly happy for him, but I also felt insecure about the whole thing. For the last few weeks, the only thing I could think about is what I would do if he gets into to the school we want and I don’t. Which is a very realistic possibility.

Yesterday I suddenly thought that I don’t want to go to law school anymore. I'm still thinking about it, but right now I feel like I just want to take another career path, one that’s different from my boyfriend’s, so that I won’t feel pressured or insecure about his accomplishments. I will have to tell him that I've decided not to go to law school anymore if that's what's really going to happen, but I don't know if I should tell him the truth or just make up a reason. I want to be honest to him because he is my SO, but wouldn't I just be making him feel that his accomplishments are bringing me down if I do?

Edit: I know that there are always going to be people who are better than me and there are always going to be lazy genius types in every field. I don't feel the insecure about other people's achievements, just with my boyfriend's."	No A-holes here	0	0
c6y9y1	2019-06-29 12:16:20	Internthrowaway97	AITA for failing an intern?	"In April, a family friend's daughter, Sarah, contacted me about doing an internship. Sarah's family is in the same business as I am, but she needed an in-family internship. I've had her work for me before, so I said yes immediately. She's a great kid and a great worker. She needed 150 hours, and we hashed out pay, I signed her internship agreement and we were on our way to a great summer. Before she started, I asked her if she was interested in a summer job (full time May to August) or if she just wanted to do her internship and be done. She indicated she would like the full time position, so I didn't hire any additional summer help.

Everything was great for the first three weeks, then she started to become unavailable due to family obligations- helping a cousin with a cross country move, a sibling's surgery- I didn't say anything because I do think a cross country road trip in college is more of an experience than working in my shop for a week. 

Except I found out that Sarah was lying about all of these things she needed to do. The last straw was when her sister called me angrily and asked if Sarah was working for me. We found out that Sarah had been telling her family that she needed to help me, and telling me she needed to help her family. I left her a voicemail telling her the hours I needed and to let me know if she was interested and did not hear back. That was about a month ago- she had approximately 40 of her 150 hours completed. 

That was about a month ago, and I didn't think any more of it, until I saw Sarah's dad at an industry event. He awkwardly asked in front of other business owners if I could still sign off on Sarah's internship. I told him I would, not wanting to make a scene. 

I connected with Sarah again, and told her I'd sign her paperwork if she could work about 10 more hours that I was desperately trying to fill. She informed me that it wasn't just a paper, it was an entire report and visit with her advisors. I told her then that I was going to need her to do more of her hours before I would meet with her advisor. She agreed. 

She did the first 10 hours, and I've contacted her to schedule more hours and she is ghosting me again. Am I the asshole if I send her her last paycheck for the 10 hours and then refuse to meet with her advisor and tell her school she's satisfactory completed an internship that she hasn't even worked half the required hours?"

c6y9t1	2019-06-29 12:15:54	dandeleopard_	WIBTA if I made my roommate pay for part of the utility bill?	"Background: I live in a 4 bedroom apartment, and I have a 12 month lease. All four of us are on individual leases, so if one person doesn’t pay rent, it won’t affect the other 3. However, we receive one utility bill, and have to divide it equally between us. 3 people (including me) are here for the summer. One roommate (K) is out of the country for the entire summer.

This morning K texted and asked if she could be left out of paying for the July utility bill, so we would divide it by 3 rather than 4. Her reasoning is that she isn’t here this summer, so she’s not using any utilities and shouldn’t have to pay for them. 

I disagree for three reasons.
1. Paying a monthly utility bill is part of her lease.
2. I wasn’t here hardly at all the entire spring, but I still paid my part of the utilities.
3. If none of us were here, the utility bill would still be a small amount. We would still all have to pay for it. 

One of my roommates liked her messages, so I guess that means she agrees with K? The other one hasn’t said anything yet. So, would I be the asshole if I told her no, you still have to pay for your part?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Just a little backstory: 
I have a friend, I'll call her Shay. Shay and I have been best friends for almost 10 years. About a year ago she married a guy I'll call Bennet. 


I absolutely cannot stand Bennet. He makes me extremely uncomfortable with his actions and words and doesn't treat Shay well at all. My fiancè also strongly dislikes Bennet and actually isn't too fond of Shay either. Shay and I dont talk as much anymore (she lives in a different state now) because just the sound of Bennet's voice makes my skin crawl. 


Now to my question, I am getting married soon and I'm not inviting Shay to the wedding because I KNOW she'll bring him even if I tell her not to. (Before anyone asks, yes, she knows how I feel about him and she knows the reasons. She just makes lame excuses for the things he's said and done to me that have made me uncomfortable and pretends the stuff he does to her doesn't happen.)  Some of my family members are telling me I'm being TA and are saying I need to invite her because she and I have been friends for so long.

A few months ago he had to undergo lithotripsy. He got the stones because he really likes salty food, and the doctors have told him to significantly lessen his salt intake, or to not eat salty foods at all. My mom(who's still working at 64 years old, and is the family breadwinner) had to pay for the procedure with her money because 1) dad has no money; he hasn't had a job in years and his pension is very small, 2) dad refused to do it ""the hard way"", which is seriously shifting his diet for months, maybe even years. 


Almost around the same time, he also had problems with his prostate. Thankfully he's in no serious danger for now, but the doctor has told him to stop eating chili/spicy food. Which he also really likes.


He's ignored all the advice. No matter how much my mom and I scold him whenever he eats what he's not supposed to, he just laughs it off and calls what happened a ""one time thing"". 


A week or two ago, my mom snapped after she saw dad putting too much patis/fish sauce(google it) and hot sauce on his food; she told dad that he can't always rely on *her* money to answer for the ramifications of *his* poor diet, because my mom already has plans for her savings and her future retirement pay. And once my mom turns 65, Philippine law will require her to forcefully retire, losing the free medical coverage she had with the company. Seriously, my dad replied with ""then I'll just register for health insurance and he'll(me) pay for it and everything else"".


Before I could respond, my mom instantly answered; ""No, he has his own things to save money for with his own money. We can't rely on our childrens' money for our future. They need money for their future, not ours"". I was happy to hear this; in Filipino culture, it's unfortunately the norm for parents to treat their kids as retirement plans. Thankfully my mom broke off from the norm.


I don't want to register my dad and pay for his medical insurance, which is a monthly deduction on my unimpressive salary. I don't want to pay for his medical insurance knowing that not only is he not doing his part to be healthy, he also persists with his unhealthy choices. I don't want to be treated as a contingency plan. I'm too busy still deciding what I want to do with *my* life. 


TL;DR Dad is actively eating what the doctors have said is bad for him and wants me to deal with the medical expenses and health insurance when he'll need medicine or an operation but I don't want to unless he makes an effort to be healthy."	Not the A-hole	0	0

c6y5ap	2019-06-29 12:01:30	Giocatore45	AITA for not telling a girl I don’t like her as much as she likes me?	"So I (23M) went on six dates with this girl (26F) which have all lasted about 4-8 hours each.

The past few times she’s hinting towards a relationship, asking personal questions regarding exes and indirectly asked the ‘what are we’ question, which I deflected. 

She’s honestly getting a bit clingy and never wants me to go when we’re on on dates even though they last quite a long time. 

It also annoys me that we have not had sex after six dates. Only making out and nothing more. She does however expect me to not date anyone else anymore, leaving me frustrated.

The main thing though is that I like her and it’s fun when I’m with her, but I’m not that much into her that I’m sure I could be with her in a relationship-context. I think she is really sweet but our interests are different and though she is objectively attractive she is also not my dream-girl looks wise. 

I’d want to see how things develop as good sex can change a lot for me personally in a relationship. Would I be an asshole for not telling her this upfront? I feel like if I say this now, she’d cut it off anyways to avoid getting hurt, which would mean we’d both have wasted our time."	Asshole	0	0

I didn't have the motivation to continue and I had just started university. Traction died down and I finally put it behind me.

Now two month ago I had received a PM from a random person requesting an extra chapter for that discontinued fic because their younger sisters loved it and their read it to them in bed, they were going through a hard time and wanted something to cheer them up. It was SFW and the request was pretty wholesome. So I agreed. 

They had even offered to pay me to do it but I declined knowing that I was flippant about continuing it in first place. 

I had told them I was in the middle of doing exams and to not contact me again until XY date when all my exams would be finished, I specified I needed to study and I needed a remind (I'm pretty forgetful) and then I can open up time to really nail it out. 

Now while I was in the middle of stressing out and studying like crazy I kept receiving messages from them around the same time and they were getting weirder and weirder.

They claimed to be from Japan but the time they messaged me was always around 2-3am. The surprise chapter for the sisters was immediately discovered when they ""stole his phone"" and started texting me in Japanese. I was further skeptical as the guy told me they were around 4-8 years old. 

They were using Kajin (Chinese characters) when usually kids around their age would limit themselves to the basic alphabets. 

A little off topic but I was as suspicious until my exams were almost over and then I received a messaging saying the girls were in a bus accident and in the hospital in life threatening condition. Bit weird that they would text me of all people about an accident but whatever. Then the sister texts me (in English) claiming their brother (the original texter) was in a car accident, a day later said he died. 

I've been suspicious of all of these text for a while and decided to ignore them. I feel incredibly guilty because I made a promise to do the commission despite it being unpaid but at the same time because I didn't take their money cause I had a funny feeling, their claims felt so bogus and ridiculously coincidental that I told myself I shouldn't let myself get baited by trolls or someone demanding context dishonestly and who will likely continue to do it if I were to give in.

c6xvrz	2019-06-29 11:29:45	Temp6774955	AITA for deciding not to travel down and see my girlfriend for one day	"So, to give some background, me and my girlfriend have been together for about 2 and a half years now. We started off living in the same area but about 6 months in, she moved 3 and a half hours away to go to a dance college. Now we’ve generally been managing the distance well, I travel down to see her every other weekend and she gets really long Easter, summer and winter holidays which she spends up where she used to live.

Now that brings us to today. She has just finished her term and I’ve just recently finished my exams. Today, she said I could come down and we could head home together so we could see each other as soon as possible (her parents are driving down and said I could come with them).

Here is the thing though, I’ve been really kind of neglecting my family recently due to exams and even since exams finished, I’ve mainly been on calls to my girlfriend to help her with some work and just generally chat. Furthermore, I went down to see her the past two weekends in a row and have also planned with her a cinema date with her tomorrow so I told her I would probably spend the day with my family, thinking that would be fine since I’ve spent so much time with her and am spending time with her the next day.

I told her this and she has gotten really upset, saying I don’t care about her and accusing me of using her. I point out the amount of time I’ve spoken to her and come down to see her and she has said I’m only being with her “on my terms” and that I should come to down to see pick her up because “I can”. I keep trying to explain that my family are important too and that I will literally see her the next day but she keeps accusing me of just not caring.

Am I the Asshole here?

tl;dr

I’ve spent lots of time with my long distance girlfriend recently but she has become very upset that I won’t travel 3 and a half hours to pick her (even though I will see her literally the next day) because I want to spend a day with my family instead. Am I the Asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I (m 48) was recently in a six month relationship with my former girlfriend (f 28) who was obsessed with me at first, and even asked me to marry her.  I resisted at first, then let her into my life, and introduced to all my friends and family.  She even said she wanted to marry me.

Then what happens? On Valentine's night no less, she slept with this guy who she is now dating, and left me via text the next day.  Few days later I realized I was having horrible pain while using bathroom, and went to get checked and guess what? She gave me gonorrhea!

Omg talk about insult to injury! Not only did she dump me for this guy, then she gave me gonorrhea!  When people asked what happened, I told everyone, and feel obliged to warn others honestly?

c6xv8e	2019-06-29 11:28:01	ultimate_throwaway5	AITA for asking my girlfriend to either muzzle her dog while I sleep or get a bark collar?	"So I (22m) have been with my girlfriend (25f) for almost 7 years now (it will be 7 years next month).  Back in late 2017 she went to live with her father after getting into an argument with her mother (long story).  For a little over a year our relationship was long distance as I was in NJ and she was in Cali.   While in Cali, she adopted a dog (a pit/rott mix).  I never saw the dog (in person) while she was in Cali because the only time I visited her she just stayed with me in an airbnb room.  Back in December I got an apartment and asked if she'd move in with me.  She said ""only if I can bring the dog"".  We discussed this and she assured me that the dog was ""house trained"" and a ""good boy"".  

Then on January 30th I picked her up in the airport and the dog barked the entire ride home, a sign of what was to come.  She brought it into my apartment and it wouldn't stop barking.  It's the loudest dog I've ever seen.  It took a piss on the floor literally 15 minutes after she took it for a walk.  She assured me that this behavior was unusual for him and that the dog ""just needs time to adjust"". 


Day after day, week after week, the dog barked all day and most of the night.  If he's not sleeping or eating, he's barking.  He's so loud that even with white noise playing and earplug in, I can still hear him.  Somehow my girlfriend isn't bothered by this and instead complains about the white noise I play.  She keeps telling me ""he just needs more time to adjust"".  I went from sleeping 8-9 hours a day to getting 4 hours of sleep a day, if that.  I work around 70 hours a week.  I need my sleep, I'm going crazy.


A month ago, I told her that since it's been 4 months with no improvement that she needs to do something about the barking.  I suggested getting a bark collar or muzzling him while I sleep and she asked if I was joking.  When she finally realized I was serious she went off on me and called me cruel for even suggesting it.  She also thinks i'm ""jealous"" of the dog because of the attention she gives it.  No joke.  

Now its been FIVE MONTHS and nothing has improved at all.  He still pees in the apartment no matter how often he's taken for a walk, and barks literally every few seconds.  We haven't has sex since the fight we got into a month ago and she's been completely unreceptive to any physical affection."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6xuxz	2019-06-29 11:27:00	roomieinhiding773	AITA for avoiding emotionally intense roommate by hiding in my room for days?	"This is a throwaway account as I know she also uses Reddit and I am hoping she won’t figure out this post is about her. 

So I have this roommate, I’ll call her “Emily”, who I usually get along with great. We’ve been living together for a year and never had any issues re: bills, cleaning, space sharing or anything major and we get along great for the most part and always had awesome conversations (we never really hang out outside of our apartment because of opposite schedules). For some background, I am about to finish up law school and she works in a challenging field where she deals with chaotic situations and crazy customers constantly. Her job is extremely challenging. She tells me she loves her job but I can tell that lately, she’s been under a lot of work stress. She works a lot of hours every week and doesn’t really have friends she hangs out with outside of work. Because of this, I think I have become her go-to person and she shares a lot of her work stress and daily woes with me. I’m happy to listen and try to lend a shoulder but I am awful at giving advice so I mostly just let her talk. She definitely dominates our conversations and I haven’t minded up until now because I know that some people just tend to talk a lot.

Lately, her complaining about her job and her life, has been draining me completely. Every time I come home, she will talk my ear off about whatever next problem or issue she’s had at work or whatever emotional saga she is going through. I try to listen but it’s really hard when she will just talk at me for 30 minutes straight and when I try to change the subject she will barely respond or get strangely quiet. I understand if she’s going through a hard time right now but days of this in a row is exhausting. I feel heavy whenever I am around her and have taken to literally sometimes pretending I am napping just to avoid talking to her. I am off work for a month and finally get some time to just be at home and for the last few days. Turns out she’s also on some sort of leave and so I’ve been hiding in my room foe the last 3 days to avoid seeing or talking to her. I just can’t take it. I feel better personally because I haven’t had to talk to her in three days even though it’s annoying that I am basically trapped in my room. I can tell she’s started to notice but she hasn’t said anything and I can feel that she is angry. She’s been slamming cupboards and the fridge door really hard and making a lot of noise in the morning, which she’s never done before. I feel really bad but I realize I cannot take anymore of her emotional baggage on. It is making me dislike her and I don’t want to think of her as a bad person because she’s not. I know I should talk to her and I will but I guess I am looking for outside opinions on this one before I do. Am I the asshole in this situation for avoiding her? Should I be more understanding? Am I right to not engage with her because it’s driving me nuts?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6xuvk	2019-06-29 11:26:42	WaffleStomperGirl	AITA for killing my mother’s soul?	"Dramatic title, I know, but hear me out; 

My mother (63 years old) has some.. uncommon beliefs. One of which is that having a photo taken of her face will somehow capture and destroy her soul. 
I don’t really know much about Aboriginal beliefs, but that’s what she has told me, and I found some supporting content online to state some people do believe it. To clarify, she’s not aboriginal, but most of her friends are and she has accepted their belief systems. 

SO. My mother is getting sick. For a long time I’ve wanted to have a photo of her because I want something to remember her. I have a hard time remembering faces as it is. 

She doesn’t know much about technology. So she doesn’t know that iPhones have cameras, or that they can be silent.
So when she was visiting I took a photo of her from across the room. 

To be very clear, I don’t believe such would have any ill effect on her. But she does. So I don’t know if this is a terrible betrayal.. or not. 

If I tell her she’ll literally think her soul has been destroyed. 

TL;DR:
Mother believes photos kills a persons soul. Literally. 
Mother is dying. 
Took a photo of her secretly so I can remember her. 
Don’t know if what I did was super bad or acceptable."	No A-holes here	0	0

"Me (16M) and my best friend of three years (17F) are going to an Ariana Grande concert in October for her birthday. We are going to stay near the arena overnight and I was in charge of booking the hotel.

It’s probably important to note that I’ve had feelings for her for a long time, she knows this and is completely fine with it, but has told me she does not reciprocate the same feelings. It does not affect our friendship at all.

When booking the hotel I was given the clear choice between two single beds or one double bed. I chose the double bed without telling her. I didn’t do this with any sexual intent, I just liked the thought of sleeping next to her. I don’t think she will care about sharing a bed.

A couple of my close friends think it’s kinda weird and a couple think it’s not a big deal.

Am I the asshole?

It’s not often I get things bought for me as my parents are... not the best. I’m quite independent despite living with them still but once a year they allow me to buy myself some presents and they’ll give me the money for it. It kind of takes the fun out of growing another year older and I love being bought things as a surprise or without me doing it myself. I know I’m an adult now but it’s been this way for a while. This year, my boyfriend (M 19) of two years kind of forgot my birthday was soon and hasn’t thought about a gift. I’m not fussed, we usually don’t do anything big for each other due to financial restrictions however this year I sent him something I really liked. It’s a relatively cheap but cute blanket for my bedroom and to bring to his house. After a while of avoiding talking about it, he outright told me he wouldn’t buy it because he didn’t like it. I tried explaining that it’s not for him and I like it a lot. He said he wouldn’t spend money on something he wouldn’t personally want. Since then he has offered to buy games he likes the look of to play together, some art he likes, or a Nintendo Switch... for him to keep at his house and I can play when I visit. I’m not angry with him I’m just a little bit upset and he’s noticed this. I don’t really feel like talking to him and I’m quite sad that on the one day a year where things get to be about me, he wants to make it about himself. We’re not talking currently and I’d rather just sit alone and try and forget I ever made the suggestion. I feel like the villain here, somehow. Am I?

c6xmar	2019-06-29 10:56:32	thestructuralguy	AITA for getting mad at my friend for berating me and calling me an idiot?	So the three of us graduated last year from the same University. We got jobs in the same company in the same department. When we work on Saturdays we usually order takeout and the bill gets reimbursed by the company as a token of appreciation for coming to work on what is usually a holiday. So today we ordered takeout as usual from an app and I made the payment for the three of us. After making the payment I was called for a meeting which lasted about an hour. After the meeting was over I looked at my phone (it was on silent mode). I saw that the delivery dude had just called. I called him back but he didn't answer so I contacted the agent through the app and he said since I was unresponsive they had cancelled the order and I won't get a refund. When I told my friends this one of them reassured me that it's not a big deal even though I was constantly telling them that I won't take any money from them as it was my fault that I didn't receive the call. Well my other friend was visibly annoyed and didn't say anything and made a snide remark about how big of an idiot I am. I have really bad social anxiety so I was quiet all the while getting really anxious. The other guy noticed and he reassured me. We contacted the agents and wrote an email and I received a reply that I would be refunded in 48 hours. The annoyed friend kept making fun of me for being stupid and told me that I'm an idiot and that idiots like me shouldn't be refunded. At this point I got really mad and I snapped and told him to never bother with me again. When I said that he started telling me that I shouldn't be mad and that it's okay to be an idiot. I didn't say anything afterwards. The other dude defended me then he fell silent too. I know it's my fault I didn't receive the call and I'm taking full responsibility for it. Am I the asshole for losing it and telling him to fuck off from my life? Because I tend to think that I shouldn't be close to people who put me down like that.	Everyone Sucks	0	0

It’s pretty confusing so I’m not even gonna try to explain it.

So basically, in between helping them out, we would just hang out and make small talk with some of the ladies. We’re teenagers and they’re mostly elderly women, so it wasn’t like flirtatious or anything.

This one lady says something about vaccines. I was worried she was gonna be like “vaccines cause autism!!!”, but then she started bagging on people who think that. I just laughed and joined in.

My 2 friends stayed silent. I didn’t think anything of it at the time.

Later, we’re eating lunch and my one friends goes “she was pro-vaccine. That was awkward”.

I thought he was joking. I was wrong.

He starts, unironically, preaching about why vaccines are dangerous and he’s seen proof of people developing autism from getting vaccinated. I’m awestruck.

Then my other friend starts throwing in his garbage. My jaw swung down like a trap door.

Without thinking I said “Wow. I didn’t realize I was friends with idiots”

They were really offended by that and I immediately regretted saying it. They acted different the rest of the day and I haven’t talked to them since then.

I never apologized.

My boyfriend (27M) and I (21F) have been living together for a month and a half. Before that, however, I always used to sleep over at his place and it was basically like we were living together for 5-6 months. We’ve been dating since September. 

Our relationship is great, and I love him very much. 

One issue however is our sleeping situation. Every time we try to sleep in the same bed, I can’t! I’m wide awake and, if I do get some sleep, it’s going to be disrupted and I’ll wake up every hour or so. 

I have had a serious relationship before, but it lasted 5 years while I was in high school, so it was pretty innocent. We never slept in the same bed. 

I tried everything. He snores, so I bought earplugs. Nope. I tried a fan to cool myself down. Nada. Bought a new memory foam pillow. HA. No. 

Sleep is very important to me (and to most people I’m sure.) I need to wake up at 5 each morning to get to work. My boyfriend doesn’t have to wake up till 8 if he wants to. (This is just to give you perspective- I need my sleep lol)

So, discouraged and lacking sleep, I’ve been sleeping on the couch for a couple weeks. And it’s a GODSENT. I can SLEEP!!! Finally!

My boyfriend, however... isn’t very happy. We had a talk about it earlier. He says he feels lonely without my cuddles, and that he’s sad. I told him I could come cuddle him for a few minutes and then go on the couch. He says it’s not the same. A fight ensues, and we’re both left angry at each other.

I’m still not that person but i had these 2 really good friends from high school and we were friends for about 7 years. One of those 2 friends eventually spent more time with me since the other one had just recently got into a relationship at the time. In all honesty, the first friend and i probably vibed and bonded a lot more. The other friend was child friends with the first friend (sorry for the confusion since I’m not including names). 

Now that we’re all adults, the only friend that doesn’t act like one is the second one. He degrade woman, like sexually abuses them by grabbing their body parts aggressively in public and “claiming her” as his own. Even though they’re in a relationship i always found that disgusting. His treatment of women and people in general has always been really bad but he was always a kind person to me until i started giving him shit for everything he does. 

We went away for my birthday with a whole group of friends and the second friend brought drugs and ended up driving drunk and almost drove off a cliff. After that i didn’t speak to them because the first friend (since they are childhood friends) chose to stay his friend while i could not. I wasn’t able to tolerate or even justify anything he did. I was always just so uncomfortable. 

After about half a year, I’m talking to the first friend back and i kinda want to get my only 2 friends back but I’m always so hesitant because i really don’t want to be friends with number 2. Just not sure if it’s all in my head or not.

During our relationship, she repeatedly tried to contact him, threw drinks over me in a club, dirty looked me every time she saw me and has since tried hitting on my current partner. 

Worse still, she’s now involved in my brothers friendship group by dating one of his best friends. They’ve been together for about two years and do nothing but fight, regularly causing a scene on nights out/ leaving early/ crying etc.

Now onto the wedding: I only have one brother and he’s one of the most important men in my life. He’s getting married to a gorgeous girl and I will be a bridesmaid, along with a few other lovely girls. This particular guest does NOT go well with the group: she barely speaks to anyone, never smiles and stands out like a sore thumb - jet black hair, piercings, white foundation etc. The rest of us get along, and all look similar if that makes sense I.e. will all look ‘together’ on photographs.

I want their day to be perfect for them, not for it to be ruined by her miserable face ‘haunting’ their photographs and causing a scene with her boyfriend if they have yet another argument.

I’m sure the answer will be yes, but WIBTA if I flat out told my brother I REALLY don’t want her there? If it makes any difference, the bride and groom don’t like her either, but because she’s one of his best friends partners feel it would be unfair to ask him to the wedding and not her."		1	0

I am the oldest daughter of 4 children. I’m currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. 

When I was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. I, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. 

This has put a strain on my mothers and I’s relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. 
She didn’t even try to keep it a secret from the kids, I remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and I’d see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. As a kid I didn’t understand, but as I got older I realized what she was doing in front of us and I feel sick. 

People ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this “family friend”. They split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. 

I’ve confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. This was roughly 3 years ago. 

My mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. They exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. I read the messages and it’s very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she’s just catching up with an old Co worker. But I know my mother, and I know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. I mean it’s been years, why else would you want to catch up?

My new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn’t agree with it, it’s been years, he wasn’t in her life yet.

She asked me what I thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. She asked for my honest opinion about the matter and I told her; 

“To be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy’s marriage and you guys had 4 kids. Idk why you think it wouldn’t ruin this one, but why don’t you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?”

She cried, said she couldn’t believe I just called her a whore and left my house. We haven’t spoken for a few days.

Today, I got a call from my siblings saying I hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy’s marriage was between them. I disagree, I had to witness my mom cheating on my father, I watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. She asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she’s selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad?

I also wanted to exit the group because a person I knew for four years was there and we had a pretty bad relationship. 

   I refused L and she kept on insisting and asking why. I gave up and we made plans for today to eat somewhere new. We made plans three days ago, but I told her that i'd rather not half a hour later after she invited me. 

      L said that if i didn't come she wouldn't come either. I told her that i wouldn't come and she took a screenshot and posted it on the group. She said she won't come because I wouldn't come. The other people gave eye-roll or angry emojis to which she responded with IK and said they wouldn't come if she wouldn't come. L basically thinks it's my fault that she didn't go.

c6x6l6	2019-06-29 10:01:33	RichGolem	AITA for not telling my friend whether a classmate was expelled and for what	"First post here, so I apologize if I mess anything up.

Everyone in this situation, other than the principal, is high school. No one mentioned is close friends with the expelled student.

So around April, a person was expelled because he said something and the principal happened to hear. He was suspended until exams, and after exams he'll be officially expelled.

I didn't personally witness this happen, but a lot of people (at least a dozen) did. I heard the story from three people, and the stories were very similar with minor differences. However, I don't know whether they witnessed it personally or not.

Then, one day, my friend wanted me to tell him what happened to the expelled student. I declined by saying that it's his privacy and I don't know the story for sure. I didn't want to tell him because if I were the expelled student, I wouldn't want people to talk about it. It was none of mine nor my friend's business, so I didn't think it was appropriate to discuss it. My friend also rarely talked to the expelled student, so it was more for curiosity than anything.

He responded by saying that it wasn't a privacy concern, as half the grade already knew about it. When I responded by saying ""Then go ask someone else"", he didn't want to for some reason. We were also opposites in terms of opinion on privacy: I am the type that tapes the webcam while he believes ""If someone hacks into the webcam to see my face, I think it is fine""

c6x378	2019-06-29 09:49:37	xyoke	AITA for blocking an old friend because I could tell he had feelings for me, despite claiming he has a fear of men falling in love with him?	"Sorry for the long title, this is something that’s been on my mind for a bit.


This friend is someone I’ve known for a while now and we use to hang out all the time during elementary school. He then  was rarely seen in high school. It wasn’t until after school was over that we saw each other more and hung out.  

Now, I’m a transgender male and my friend made it very clear that he doesn’t like the idea of any men having feelings for him.  

I had to house sit for a family member and since there was only one bed, i recommended we share it because he was over at the time and it was a far drive.  I thought, we are two men there’s nothing wrong with that. Apparently I started cuddling him in the middle of the night. At this point I’m sort of awake so I go to move away but then he kisses me right on the lips, thinking that I’m asleep.  At this point I turn away pretending like I’m still sleeping. 

I don’t bring it up at all.

A couple weeks go by and we are texting each other, when he mentions randomly that he wants to masterbate and tells me I should too. His comment makes me uncomfortable but I don’t tell him that and just ignore that text messages. In my mind I think, he wouldn’t say this if I was born male instead of female but maybe I’m just being too sensitive. He then later tells me how he wants to go on a trip just the two of us, but when I refuse because I don’t like the idea of camping, he gets mad at me and refuses to talk to me for a couple days. After a while he calms down and we are driving somewhere in the car when he grabs my leg and squeezes it saying he’s marking his territory.

At this point I don’t know what to think, he’s being weird but it makes frustrated because he said that to me despite saying that he will never have feeling for men/doesn’t want men to have feelings for him. It’s after this that we pretty much stop hanging out, I realize that he’s making me uncomfortable after talking with other friends and delete him from all social media and block him everywhere and tell me to never talk to me again. He asks why and I explain to him that he never treated me like  a man and that I felt uncomfortable.  He keeps asking what I mean by that and I provided the examples but he still didn’t understand.  I even made new social media accounts and he found me there and tried following me, pretending like everything was fine. I blocked him again.

Am I the asshole for allowing him to treat me this way and not telling him how I feel until it was too late?

I told my parents (I'm a teen) that I wanted to leave at 10PM after a few hours at my grandparents' house. I said that after 10, the young cousins go to sleep, all the adults start drinking (liquor that I can't drink) and watch TV and talk and stuff. It feels like I am not doing after after 10 because I feel uninvited. (Yes I had this event before) I have no one to talk to and the only thing I have on me is my phone. Since the adults are being loud and I cant sleep, I kill some time browsing social media and listenig to music, but that feels like a waste of time because, you know, when was social media ever healthy.

My parents got very angry at me for asking if I could have my dad take me home after 10. They tell me I am being mean to my family, and that you are selfish. My mom tells me: ""Why can't you just deal with one night to make the family happy?"" ""Nothing important happens at home!"".

c6x1cm	2019-06-29 09:43:06	thr0w4waybrodas	WIBTA if I cancel a 3-months-planned date?	"^(Throwaway account because some family members know my normal account.)

&#x200B;

About 6 months back, a friend introduced me at a little gathering to a girl. I asked her for her number because she seemed really nice and cool, which she gave me.

&#x200B;

Ff 2.5 months, we've been chatting every third-or-so day, understand each other, have fun, we also went out 2 times before she needed to go to the other coast. She leaves for the coast and after a little bit more time, while she's gone, I ask her out on a date (after she gets back obviously), to which she says yes.

&#x200B;

Ff to about a week ago. I was telling my friend this after we met again, and he told me to not get my hopes up. I asked why, to which he responded ""Well, she is an ace."" Not knowing what that was, I chatted with him about it and her, he also provided some proof. Turns out she is asexual and also bi (in her own words ""more gay than straight"").

&#x200B;

I'm not sure if I should go on a date with her. I don't want to change her preferences/sexuality, that's absolutely not in my repertoire. But then again, maybe she could be interested in me since bi doesn't mean solely lesbian. I'm thinking about canceling the date (which would be next week), and telling her we would be better off as friends. WIBTA?

c6wy11	2019-06-29 09:31:16	reportmydoctoryesno	WIBTA if I report my primary care doctor for his poor on-call doctor/phone staff?	"Yesterday I went to my primary care doctor for a spider bite I was worried may get infected. 
They saw me promptly and gave me a good diagnoses/prescription (antibiotics) for the spider bite.

&nbsp;

(Here is where I mess up) On my way home from work I took out the trash and I accidentally threw out my prescription. 
  
&nbsp;

I called my primary care immediately at 3:00 pm. They are closed but have a on-call doctor hotline. 

&nbsp;

I get through and leave a message with the receptionist and she tells me the on-call doctor will call me back shortly. 

Two hours pass by. I call the on-call doctor line again, same thing.

Three hours pass by. I call the on-call doctor line again and tell them CVS closes within one hour and I need this prescription. The nurse practitioner who saw me earlier in the day told me if my spider bite went untreated I would of needed intravenous antibiotics. I explained this politely even though they have been rude to me from the start.

&nbsp;

She tells me it's Friday night and people do things. I tell her I called them originally at 3:00 pm which is two hours before  business closing hours. She told me there is nothing she can do.

&nbsp;

I them ask them, ""What is the point of a on-call doctor who isn't on-call? What about the other doctors at my primary care, can you contact one of them?"". She again stated there is nothing she can do.

&nbsp;
I hang up and call the medical group they are part of. I explain the situation to their customer service and she tells me she'll absolutely help me. 

&nbsp;

Ten minutes before my CVS closes, I get the call from my primary care doctor (the owner) and get the prescription refilled. 
He was  condescending to me and seemed to try and guilt trip me he was at his nieces wedding. I didn't say anything but thanks for getting me the prescription. 


&nbsp;

**I have a few major concerns that I think may warrant me reporting the practice:**

1. The only reason I got my prescription refilled was because I was diligent with trying to get their on-call hotline to do their job and willing to take it a step further. Someone who doesn't want to deal with confrontation may have let the whole situation go. This could have result in major problems depending on their medical needs.
2. I always had the option to go to a urgent care, which I was about to do. However I would of needed to spend between $150.00 to $300.00 for a prescription refill. I am fortunate that a cost of that amount isn't a huge deal for me. For someone else though, depending on their lives/health insurance an extra $150.00 or more expense could be a very big deal.

Essentially I am considering reporting the practice because I worry about someone in a less fortunate or bigger medical emergency than I had going through the same thing.

Yeah it’s a cool country, nature is pretty. But there’s nothing to do. We’re staying in smaller city rn. I haven’t met single person I can have conversation with. Most of the people speak broken English and they have heavy accents so I can’t understand what they’re saying.

c6wu57	2019-06-29 09:16:57	HayzyCloud	AITA for telling a guy that the way his single mother treats animals is horrible?	"For context, I met a guy on Tinder. Things were going well until we moved over to snap chat. The usual small talk ensues until he spots my pet Cockatiel. He casually says, ""yeah my sister used to have 6 of them, but one of them started eating out its own chest"" immediately alarm bells go off, because for those of you who don't know, birds that aren't taken care of properly pluck their feathers out. I tell him this and ask what happened to the birds.

 He said his Mum feed them for a few months after his sister left but got sick of looking after them and set them free. Which horrified me even further because where we live, the birds would have likely died of exposure. I told him this, saying that if they didn't have the time/resources to  look after the birds they should've given them to the SPCA or other similar organizations. Saying that because of the actions of him and his family, the animals suffered. He got very defensive and angry, saying that its not his fault because they weren't his birds, and not his responsibility. As well as that because his Mum is a single parent working full time, she was too busy to take them to the SPCA.

 I still believe that its horrifying that someone can live in the same house as a suffering animal and not do anything.

 And i still believe that being busy is not an excuse for animal abuse.

Am I just out of touch? Is it possible that his  Mum really didn't have time? I never said that any of his family was a bad person, just ignorant and made bad decisions which cause suffering.

c6wtma	2019-06-29 09:15:05		AITA for disliking my biodad, and feeling like I might cut him out of my life eventually?	"(Note: Before we get into this, I wanted to let u know that all the names are fake, and that if you need any form of clarification, I will be mostly happy to provide it. Anyways, lets get started!) 

So, my bio dad is quite a bit of a deadbeat. He almost never sees or talks to me, he's somehwat late on his child support, and we never really got to have an emotional bond because my parents were divorced, and my Mom took me w her to another state then the one we resided in because she didn't see how she could make their relationship work (due to Kent being on parole at the time for committing a felony, and for other reasons.), and because he almost never sees me in person. 

He always likes to promise me a lot of things. But he almost either never follows though,is lying, or the plans change.It makes me really upset currently when this happens, but I am somewhat numb to it because it pretty much has been happening my entire life. 

Also, whenever he gets into a new relationship/has a gf, he always seems to prioritize them over me and Reece, as his girlfriends were always normally pretty mean to me and Reece, and some of them actually abused Reece, but Kent either didn't really seem to care. Or if he did, he always made it clear that he was prioritizing his floozies over his kids (Ex of this are when he allowed his ex gf to deny me a trip to a school dance for no reason, him endorsing her of being mean to me, always defending their actions until Kent and them break up, etc.). 

Kent also refuses to sign over his rights to my dad, Eric, as while he almost never interacts with me he still feels the need to be a part of my life, (or something, idk), even though we almost never talk or contact each other frequently/at all.  

Also, he's moved onto another person, who is called Belle, and he welcomed another son into his family, Mark. I'm not really sure how to feel about it, as while I am a bit excited for a new brother, I am worried that we will not get along because of how Belle has acted towards me (Insulted me by basically calling me unathletic in a snotty tone, never seeming to actually like seeing me, etc.) as well as the fact that I don't really know how to interact with little kids, and I don't really like how energetic they are. (Also Mark has a mental/physical disorder, and I don't really feel all that comfortable interacting with kids like that as I don't know how too, even more so than interacting with little kids.)

And while ik that I shouldn't feel like this, but sometimes I feel like that is current family is a replacement of mine, and that it is my fault that he never seems to want anything to do with me because of my autism, and other things. It sometimes makes me feel worthless, and it somewhat feeds the depression that I currently have.

Anyways, now to the juicy bits.

His parents are treating the closest family and friends to a dinner to celebrate. That's pretty customary where we live.

A few weeks ago, my cousin asked me if I wanted to bring my boyfriend (23) to the party. They know each other and get along, plus we've been together for 4 years. My boyfriend agreed and we've been making arrangements to free up that particular weekend.

Yesterday, my cousin suddenly texted me about his close childhood friend (20sF) making it to the dinner. She currently lives abroad and they haven't seen each other in a long while. I should note that over the years, she's become something of a religious fundamentalist under the influence of her husband and his parents.

My cousin basically asked me if I'd do him a favor and ask [insert my boyfriend's name] if he would mind skipping the party, because his friend would be uncomfortable having a gay couple around her kids. Now that's pretty ridiculous since my boyfriend and I aren't ever affectionate in public (not our thing), so there's really nothing to shield their kiddos from except for two adults sitting next to each other. However my cousin insists she would be uncomfortable with the very notion.

Would it be inconsiderate if I completely skipped the dinner? My boyfriend and I made our plans together and I don't see the point in attending without him, especially not to appease some fundamentalist. Besides I can give my cousin our gift and the card at any point."	Not the A-hole	0	0

In order to graduate in December from university, I need to take one summer class. It's cheaper this way. However it needs to be paid up front.
Few weeks ago I asked my dad if he would pay for it cause I don't have the fund$ and he agreed. 
Fast forward to today, I'm reminding him I need to pay it and asking him if he will deposit the money into my account. He said sure, then asked which class.
I said ' Sexualities'
He said that it was ridiculous and he refused to pay for it anymore. He said it was so offensive to him and offensive I would even take the class and crazy the uni even offers it. 
He mentioned I'm engaged anyways and I don't need to learn about that stuff anyways. (I'm not engaged- thanks for paying attention Dad?) 

He told me to send him the other courses offered and he'd pick one. 


Here's the course description of the sexualities class - "" Multi-disciplinary course draws from psychology, sociology, biology, history, cultural anthropology, law, Hawaiian, ethnic, feminist, gender, and queer studies to explore human sexualities with emphasis on the U.S., Hawai'i and the Asia-Pacific regions"" 


To ease him I sent him some other options.. indigenous women's studies, middle eastern politics... Both of which would be interesting but not nearly my first pick.


I really don't think it's an offensive class or that he should be so weird about. It's an easy A, so it's a GPA booster and a lot of my classmates have recommended it as it's fun and interesting. 

It is his money tho so idk.

Soo basically back in January I(18F) had a party. I left my old school last year and moved to another school so I don’t see them a lot anymore. But, Ive thrown a lot of house parties before (even swore myself my last would actually be my last but lol). Last time someone broke something which in the end was 1000€ worth of damage so THIS time I told my friends that the limit was 25 people.

Anyway- I added everyone into a group chat on WhatsApp, told them the deal and a lot asked me wether they could bring someone. It was all good, I knew the people they’d bring and everything. I trusted them all since they knew about the damage last time. Jack knew this as well as he asked me if he could bring another person. I said ok. The night of the party jack came over to me. He pulled me into an empty room and told me he had invited 11 people. Without telling me. Some were from a school which is known to be full of shitty people who mess up parties. But, alas, i said ok. I told him if ANYTHING gets stolen he’d pay for it and he said ok. 

Bing bong what happened? My make up was stolen. A little over 100€ worth.. its not as much as last time but it included this ‘fresh’ rose water which is almost 50€... i told him about it and he apologized, saying he’d pay for it. I do feel kinda stupid but the water was a gift so..

Its now been 6 months. Two months after he didn’t pay i reminded him. He said he’d pay. Nothing. A month later i reminded him again. Then again. Then again. I have now texted him at least 10 times over the past 3 weeks with not even him READING my messages... i sent him a paragraph basically telling him what a shitty friend he is. That was about 2 weeks ago. Im seriously pissed. We’ve been friends for 4 years and every time he needed a little money id give some to him. Im well off and privileged, i know that. But so is he. My gut feeling is telling me he’s waiting until i forget since he’s moving away to uni. 

My bf told me i should text his twin brother about it, since he’s a little more mature.. 

So.. WIBTA if i post the chat on my insta story so all of my old classmates see? I know they’d be pissed at him. Still, i feel dumb as this is over rose water but.. yea..

He wouldn’t leave me alone, and kept saying creepy things to me- even after I had not replied to him and just nervously laughed at his comments, because I was feeling very uneasy about the whole situation.

Finally I had to tell them to ""stop saying that! Of course he loves his brother more, it's his BROTHER.""

My son and his brother lives together 100% of the time until they were 5&11.  They have been best friends since the day my son was born.  They are still VERY close, and it's like no time has passed as soon as they see one another.

Of course, I started to feel like an asshole as soon as I said that he didn't love them as much."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

c6wmdg	2019-06-29 08:48:06		AITA for playfully arguing with a guy at a networking event	"TL;DR at the end.

Yesterday  I went to a young professionals networking event, where the word entrepreneurship was thrown around a lot. You know the type. I went with a friend, let's call her Hannah.

The lectures and whatnot ended by 6 and we went to a pub afterwards. While the networking event was very professional, the atmosphere became very casual immediately, some people even ordered shots. 

Throughout the evening, I was mostly having a conversation with my side of the table, including this one guy Jerry. We talked about politics and out work but also made jokes and banter about where everyone was from and what we were doing. Meanwhile, Hannah was having a separate conversation with people on her side of the table, which also seemed lively.

The evening went on and when we were about to leave, I told Jerry to pass me my bag, he asked which one it was and I replied the green one. He said there is no green one, so I took it myself and showed it to him. This is where the ""controversy"" began. He got play mad and said the bag was blue. Your typical white/gold black/blue dress situation. I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it, but he went on a tirade on how on earth could I consider that bag to be green. At that point, a lot of other people chimed in, as it happens with these things, and soon enough people were pulling up swatches of turquoise on their phones and it was a whole thing, very much in line of the banter of the evening. We later reached a conclusion to agree to disagree and we hung out with everyone for like two more hours, talking about lots of stuff with someone occasionally bringing up the bag controversy as a joke.

Now for the AITA part, when my friend and I went home, she went off about how she never wanted to hear about the bag again and about about how she's glad we had to catch the bus because ""who knows where I would have slept tonight"", implying I would have cheated on my boyfriend with Jerry and that I was the asshole for what I guess she considered to be flirting during a professional networking event.

I took offense to this as I had never cheated on anyone and was not even remotely close to it. He did try to convince us to stay drinking the whole night and catch the first bus in the morning which I declined but even if he somehow conspired that might lead to us hooking up, how is that my fault?

So Reddit, am I the asshole?

"Me and my boyfriend have been planing for a while to go to the seaside for holidays together, and a week or so ago, one of his friends told him that she was thinking of going there during the same period, and asked is she could hang with us. 

This would have been more than ok with me, but then she stared hinting that she'd want to share a room with us, or at least stay in the same hotel/hostel together. Me and my bf were obviously not thrilled at the idea of sharing a room (bye-bye intimacy) but said that yeah, we could look for a place that has two 2-people bedrooms available (mind you, this place is almost always fully booked, so this was sort of an impossible task; also, we found another friend to stay with her, so she wouldn't be alone).

I searched and searched, but the only accomodations I found that were available and had +2 rooms were  quite a bit over my budget, so we settled for a hostel that had only one small twin room left. I talked with my bf, and since we were staying longer than his friends, and none of them gave their opinion/advice about places to stay, I booked it, paying the full sum in advance.

Well, the next day, his friend text him saying that she found two camper vans where we could stay and that she'd be willing to split the cancellation fee I had to pay if I gave up my booking, so we could all stay together. I refused, because I didn't like that place as it had less facilities than our room and was even more far away from the main attractions.

c6whyt	2019-06-29 08:31:32	KeepShipsInFandom	WIBTA if I (22F) decided to give my sister(17F) the birthday present she wanted to someone else?	"My little sister is a very big of a Supernatural. Her room is full of Supernatural memorabilia and her OTP is Destiel (Dean Winchester and Castiel). She loves this and the actors (Jensen Ackles and Misha Collins) who play them. For her birthday she really wants to go to a Supernatural convention especially now since the show is ending and have a photo op with the actors. I have no problem with this and I told her I would be happy to buy her a ticket as I planned to go myself and it can be her birthday present. However, a few days ago I overheard her say to a friend that she wants me to hold up a sign say ""Destiel Rocks"" and have Jensen and Misha pretend to kiss. She said something about smashing their faces together so she could get proof of Destiel since show has been queerbaiting for years which I find rather disrespectful of the actors especially as they have little say over the script.

WIBTA if I decided against taking her? I have already bought the tickets but I can ask around and take someone else instead.

Was told to add this here:  Part of the issue is that she's the kind of person who knows what she  wants and isn't afraid of going for it. An example would be punching the  walls repeatedly so there's a hole in them when my oldest sister (OS)  refused to let her borrow a dress of hers for a party. My sister (16F)  wore it anyway and then destroyed the dress so  OS couldn't wear it  anymore."	Asshole	0	0

"This is a completely hypothetical question, as I’m not planning to have children for another few years. But I’m a planner, so this is something that’s been bothering me for a while. 

For context, I’ve been with my husband for over ten years (yes, we got together young) and we’ll likely have kids in a few years. 

My SIL has started having kids, and my parents in law didn’t want to go by anything traditional like grandma/grandpa/grandad/nanny/pop/gran etc. In conjunction with my SIL, they chose two names that are... absolutely vomit-inducing cutesy. Neither my husband or I were involved in this discussion (and nor should we have been) and my nieces/nephews have been using these names for several years now. 

Now I’m worried that they are going to insist that my kids use those names for them too. 

Normally I’m a pretty live-and-let-live person, but I honestly think I’m going to struggle to use these names for them. I can’t say them without cringing or laughing. 

WIBTA if I told my parents in law that they have to pick a different name for my kids to call them? (Absolutely happy for it to be anything that doesn’t make me want to vom every time I hear it...)

Edit: Since apparently the names are important, it’s along the lines of Grannypoo/Poppypoo/Mamsy/Grampsy... but obviously none of these. I don’t want to say, as I think it would make it too identifiable."	Not enough info	0	0

Her brother found us making out in the bleachers and her parents whom were strict Christians,  and I was openly aiethiest and just an all round douchbag trying to get reactions. Satanic shirts, piercings, ect. They locked on the ideal that I had to have forced myself on their Christian daughter. Through the courts I had to plead guilty, school cameras ect. The DA and judge both made their comment that if they had to charge every senior flirting with the lower class the world would be filled with sex offenders. But I did fall on that list for lewdness involving a minor. Fast forward 8 years. Now 26 and it's hard to find employment and housing. I finally gave up and omitted any of these facts. I got fired from my job kitchen staff at a chain restaurant because I lied on my application.  
While I admit and see the value of not lying on a app and the rules that allow them to fire me because of it. I still need work, and pay, and basic needs as shelter, clothes and food. AITA for omitting my criminal history on my job applications?
Edit: No I cant appeal, 14 more years until I can clear my record and that is if the state I live in will allow sex offenses to be cleared. There's a certain stigma and scapegoating that goes with being a sex offender. Which I wont debate both because this isn't the place and I don't wholly disagree with it.

c6wbyo	2019-06-29 08:09:50	film_diva	WIBTA if I don’t attend my sister’s wedding?	"My sister and I grew up close, and, in my opinion, I’ve done a lot for her. There were some years we didn’t see each other as much and didn’t get along so great, but we’ve both matured (I hope) and moved past all that. 

However, she recently came by to show me some stuff she got for her bridesmaids. Which was how I found out I wouldn’t be in the wedding party. I was shocked because I’m, ya know, her sister? I’ve also come to learn that our cousin is going to be a bridesmaid and they’ve always been “frenemies.”

The only reason I can think of for why she wouldn’t ask me is because of how I felt about her fiancé when they first started dating. There was basically overlap with his girlfriend before her. I tried to warn my sister about him (which I’ve since learned to keep my mouth shut on people’s love lives). That was her very first (and now only) boyfriend, and I just didn’t think cheating was a good way to start a relationship. Of course, I’ve gotten to know him now, and he seems like a decent guy who truly loves my sister. 

So back to the wedding party. I can’t dream of confronting my sister about why she didn’t ask me. I know that it’s her wedding and it should be exactly as she envisioned. But I’ve talked to my mom about it who admits she’ll be embarrassed when people see that I’m not a bridesmaid. I don’t want that tension or embarrassment either. I kind of just want to be “sick” that day and skip the whole thing so everyone can just enjoy themselves, but would that make me an asshole? I didn’t attend my brother’s wedding this year either, but that was a last-minute quickie wedding that I legitimately could not attend.

Update: It sucks, but I’d definitely be the asshole if I didn’t go. I’m gonna put on my big girl panties and attend the wedding despite my hurt feelings and any awkwardness from the other guests. As far as talking to my sister about why she didn’t include me, I still have to figure out the right way and time to approach that. Despite my feelings about all of this, I still want her to have her ideal wedding and wouldn’t want to distract from a time when she’s really supposed to be happy."	Asshole	0	0

I was 23 and in the throws of college senior partying. I woke up one day and met with a friend for lunch at Taco Bell. It’s 10 am and I’m hungover as hell, screaming f-ing headache and about to pass out level hangover. 

We walked in to T-Bell and there is a couple there with their 2 kids. One was (I’d guess) 3 and the other was about 1 but the baby was so huge it was hard to accurately guess age. 

We ordered our food and sat down for a conversation. Suddenly,the baby (in a high chair) starts SCREAMING. This as not ok for my hangover but I didn’t say anything for awhile. After about 5 minutes of nonstop screaming in this tiny ass T-Bell with the parents doing nothing but ignoring it,I had to do something. 

I asked the mom politely if she could try to keep her baby quiet. She deadass looked at me and said “What do you expect me to do?” In a bitchy tone. I was hungover and now mad because of her tone. I  said “I expect you to control your child or eat at home.” At this point Dad came back from the bathroom and laid into me about me about not having kids and not knowing how hard it is.

I say to them we were hungry and they say it’s stupid and refuse to let me back in with the pizza. So I call my friends inside and tell them to come out , but when they get to the door the teachers refuse to let them out. So I ring up my friends again and tell them to run around the side of the building and grab some before it gets cold , my friend joe comes sprinting out of the door , grabs the pizza and screams “IM BREAKING YOUR RULLESS” as he runs back for the door.

There’s roughly 1500 people leaving the theater in one huge, slow progression onto the streets and sidewalks of a busy downtown area. Tali’s are pulling up, people are bunching up at the street corners cheek to jowl waiting for the light to change. (I apologize to the man I accidentally bad-touched. I’m very short and your butt was hand height. I didn’t have a good time either)

Several people get four of five feet onto the sidewalk, still well within the “oh god I’m suffocating” part of the crowd, and start taking photos of each other. The crowd moves around them, which means I’m nudged off in completely the wrong direction. 

Am I the asshole for walking between the person with their phone out and the people they’re taking photos of in this situation? They clearly thought so.

c6w6td	2019-06-29 07:50:47	iamriles024	AITA for shouting at a 7 year old for terrorizing my dogs by obnoxiously bouncing his basketball and walking closer to me?	"So, I have two dogs that I rescued. One short-haired jack russell(Jax) and a miniature pincher(Leia) and both of them are very timid but nonetheless loving doggos. 

Jax took me about 6 months just to even let me(male) put a leash on him. I would walk up to him slowly with the leash and he would cower and pee throughout the house just to fall to his side and surrender, thus allowing me to leash him up.  Finally, after 6 months of patience and perseverance, he started to trust me and allowed me to leash him up no issues! (Not looking for validation here, just backstory) 

Leia, my minpin, is highly protective of me and feels the need to alert me to any incoming ""threats"". She's got an attitude of a much much larger dog than she actually is. 

Now, today I am out walking my dogs and I usually mind my own business so that they get the deed done and take them back, and I see this little boy across the courtyard with his basketball. This little guy knows my dogs can be a handful when people and dogs walk by so I divert directions so that I can peacefully remain on my walk. 

I turn around and he starts following me, so I try to keep minding my own business, turned my back to him and hoping this kid gets the hint. Nope. This guy decides to full on sprint up to me and Leia and Jax go NUTS. He was startled that they were barking at him so I thought he would just leave me alone as I'm pulling them in the opposite direction. NOPE. This little.... For lack of words, asshole decides to start slamming his basketball on the cement scaring the shit out of Jax and at this point he's on his side terrified. He's laughing...

I snapped and yelled ""Hey, quit fucking terrorizing my dogs! What's wrong with you!?"" And the kid starts CRYING. I'm dismayed at the whole situation so I just got my dogs to start running with me back to my house. AITA!?

 I didn't even want to be mean and I'm not an aggressive person whatsoever.

c6w6e8	2019-06-29 07:49:16	sapphirebuddha	AITA for laughing in this woman’s face?	"This happened a few days ago, and now that I’ve processed it I want to know if I was in the wrong.

I was walking a dog around the perimeter of a local (public) park, and a woman was sitting in a folding chair she brought from home and was chatting on the phone really close to the path I was walking on. Cool.

The dog and I circled around once and I started chatting with another lady on the opposite end for a little bit and then I decided to walk around the perimeter with the pup again before the end of our scheduled walk.

This is where it got weird. We got closer to this lady since we were about to pass her cause she was so close to the path, and at that point the dog I was walking wanted to sniff around a bit and I let her. In retrospect it looked like we were stopped nearby this woman, but in NO way were we weirdly in her personal bubble. We would have walked away sooner if she hadn’t interacted with us. I was also halfway spaced out listening to a podcast and in no way paying attention to this lady.

In my peripheral vision I saw her waving her arms (after I realized what was going on I got the feeling she was going to be rude to me) and I paused the podcast and pulled out one of my earplugs to see what was going on. 

She said, “UHM, I’m having a PRIVATE conversation here,” 

Shot her my signature look and retorted, “I’m not listening.”

This woman proceeded to get out of her chair and say something like, “Well, (something something something) you need to leave RIGHT NOW, because someone is in MY SPACE, wahhhh!” (It looked like she was about to have a tantrum)

The entire time I thought the way she handled this situation was incredibly immature and that she didn’t deserve my respect. We were in a public space and I was not intentionally intruding on her. For this I let out a huge guffaw and started laughing at her and ended up walking away. The interaction was now over.

Even 30 minutes after I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth as I have never encountered a situation like this. I was thinking- even though this was a public space, was I wrong to stop on the path nearby this lady paying no mind to her or was I disrespecting her personal space?

I like cooking, specially desserts. As my boyfriend’s best friend loves cheesecake, I told him that next time she comes around I’ll be making one (because usually when we throw a party I make a dessert, this time is like any other occasion/gathering). I guess he thought that I was making one for her (like in giving it to her specifically) rather than just making it because it’s a party.  

Well, my BF is throwing the party tomorrow, At this point I already made the cake. But the problem is this: I live with my parents and every Saturday my family has a small reunion (Lots of siblings, uncles, aunts, etc), they bring food and we eat together. My brother and his kids always eat my cheesecakes, as well as my nephews. I feel happy when they ask me about when it’s the next time I’ll be cooking one. That’s why I told my BF if it was okay to bring half of the cake to the party he is throwing (the cake is pretty big and only 8 people are attending the“party”). 

He got offended and told me “How could You give half of the cake to her and not feel bad?”, “If you are giving a gift, you have to do it right”. He told me later that he already told his friend that I was making a cake specially for her, but I never intended to give it to her as a present, my cakes are not that good (quite homemade and simple).  He told Me to make a post it on the cake saying “DONT’T EAT” and wants to make me tell my mom to forbid everyone from eating that thing. I don’t want to tell my brother and nephews to not eat the cake, they are very young and I don’t want to see them get sad.

I had all the parts already bought and setup except for the GPU which took months due to delays. So I bought a Gigabyte Windforce RTX 2070. It arrived and my brother and I decided ""no overclocking!"" It worked fine for like a month before my brother calls me one day and says that the GPU is artifacting. And I was devastated. Only 2% of cards are defective and *of course* ours would be one of the 2%. So we send it back, takes a while but the RMA is done and they send back the GPU. I notice it is the same box and the same card so I start worrying thinking they probably didn't even fix it. Well, it works and we're happy again. 
   So it works fine until 5 days later when it artifacts again. Now I'm just extremely pissed off and RMA it again and demand that they completely replace the card and they say ""We only fix, not replace. That is our policy"". Well fuck your policy! I tried to make noise on Reddit thinking maybe I could get lucky and be one of those guys whose post grows big and is seen by the company and they apologize and send a new card right away. **Of course not**. I'm pretty sure those are fake and never happen anyway. I eventually gave in and decided to RMA it and then sell it when it came back to make some money back so I can buy a new RTX 2070 from a different company. Now there is a good chance that the card is defective again, but if I don't sell it for some of the money then it would be difficult to afford a new card. Like what do I do if the guy I sell it to comes back to me all angry if it is broken? Out of the 6 months we've owned this PC, for 5 of those months it has just been an expensive decor piece.

However, prior to this break there were many times where I covered her for emotional problems, depression, financial problems, family issues, etc. under my encouragement she recently started taking antidepressants (around time we decided to take a break) and I left the apartment we lived in together to give her space. A week or so has passed and she’s gotten more distant, emotional unavailable, and acted as if my feelings are less important than she used to act. I understand the reason for the break... because we were bickering a lot and needed to individually grow.. but when I expressed my concerns about a middle ground she acted as if I’m making her feel guilty and pressured. She doesn’t want to text me often and she wants to see me on her terms. This is all well and good but I feel like I’m being played for a fool. She just got her dream job out of no where after this and she’s been going out like 5 times a week. the car she drives was leased by me and is in my name and so is the apartment I let her stay and live in. It’s also mostly my furniture and the TV is mine. She knows I’m down on my luck and don’t have a lot of support and am at my worst financial point in a while. She is being very limited with her responses even though we said we’d remain friends and monogamous throughout this break and it was more of a physical space thing.


So, WIBTA for going to “our” apartment tomorrow and taking back all my things and my car? Personally I feel like she may be growing apart and just be segwaying into leaving me high and dry and making the break up very emotional and physically/financially difficult for me. Please any input would help."	Everyone Sucks	1	0

c6vyf7	2019-06-29 07:22:21	tripletquadruplet	AITA for making sarcastic jokes about my boss and his girlfriend?	"All of this happened in a recording studio which is also a home to my boss and his girlfriend.  And this happened yesterday when I was recording in the studio room and the couple started screaming and throwing things around as they were fighting about something in the adjacent room. We can hear most of the the sound from the studio as the sound leaks. I jokingly told the other person in the studio room that this was pretty normal and they threw things at each other all the time and it was very usual. And I asked her if she would have ever thrown stuff at each other with her husband in her life. I was merely generalizing things and being sarcastic. I tried to make the situation a little light inside the recording room so that we could continue recording. And not really intended to be wicked about it. 
This other person in the room happens to know my boss for a long time because she's the sister of his best friend.
Today I got to know that she ratted me out and told my boss about how I was joking about the couple while the said fight was going on. 
Now my boss is angry at me and all the other people who work with him. He said that I was considered a good friend and now I have betrayed him and I talked behind his back in his own office/home. He was pretty put off by all this. I know that I fucked up but I didn't really mean to hurt anyone.

c6vx31	2019-06-29 07:17:52	Comrade_Michael	"AITA for telling an elderly man he ""could have asked politely"" to use the gym machine I was hogging?"	" I (24M) go to the gym close to closing time (10pm) so that it's empty, which it was when our story takes place.

&#x200B;

So I'm the only one in the weight room for a long time. I got on the rear delt machine, which faces away from the rest of the weight room so that when you're sitting down at it, you get a view of an empty hallway, but can't see anyone else entering the weight room.

One more thing: I use my phone's stopwatch to time my rests between sets. I don't use any apps except for my stopwatch and I leave it sitting on my lap during rests. I was getting tired so I gave myself a full three minute rest before my last set. As I'm putting my phone away an old man (75?M) cranes his neck over my shoulder and says ""Are you going to be on your cell phone for much longer?""

""I was using it as a timer. Did you want to use this machine?""

""I would like to.""

""Well I'm about to start my last set--""

""Okay--""

""You could've asked politely."" 

""--I'll work on something else.""

He then disappeared for however long it took me to do my set, came over, did one quick set and went home.

Here's the case against me as I see it: it's very possible he perceived me to be using my phone to dick around while hogging the machine. The mitigating factors that work in my favor, that the phone was sitting untouched in my lap and that it was using the stopwatch feature, are nuances that are likely lost on him. I'm making a guess here, but since he called it a ""cell phone"" (which I associate with elderly people who are intimidated by smartphones and primed for anti-millennial-phone-use sentiment) I think he earnestly believed me to be dicking around. Then he comes up to me and calls me on it and when he's corrected and responds in a somewhat nicer tone I snidely chastise him, a grown-ass adult man who's just trying to get home.

Because he came up right at the end of the rest period before my last set and because I can have no idea whether he was watching me because of the position of the machine, it's possible he could've waited while watching me sit on my ass doing nothing but glance at my phone every couple of seconds for a full three minutes. It was late and close to closing time (\~30 minutes away). Since he left after his set, it makes me think I was the only obstacle standing between him and getting out of the gym to enjoy the rest of his Friday night.

The case against him as I see it: *He could've asked politely*. Even if I had been dicking around and had multiple sets left, I would've gladly worked him into my rotation. I thought the weight room was empty. Whether his perception is justified or not, he still made an assumption that I was dicking around and therefore phrased his question in a really snotty way. There is also another rear deltoid machine in another part of the gym, albeit one that is maybe a 90 second walk away from the one I was at."	No A-holes here	0	0

We put our older kids in part time summer camp about 40 minutes from where we live and planned on sharing the drive and childcare. On Mondays I was going to keep the 2 year olds and my friend would drive the 4 year olds in to town and have a kid free day. On Wednesdays I was going to drive the 4 year olds in and my friend was going to keep the 2 year olds. 
A couple weeks ago my friend’s 2 year old started biting and he’s bitten my daughter twice. I decided that I’m not comfortable leaving my 2 year old with my friend until her son’s biting phase passes. I understand it’s a phase a lot of kids go through and I will still spend time with my friend and her kids, but I’m not going to leave my daughter for 7 hours with a biter. 
I was tactful and didn’t blame anyone when I told my friend we’d have to postpone the childcare sharing until the biting stopped. I apologized and said we all love her son and I’m sure the phase will pass quickly. She was still offended and pointed out that he didn’t break skin with either bite. She’s tried to push me into trying it out for a day to see how it goes and is obviously upset that I won’t agree. I know she’s disappointed that now we both have to drive in and neither of us get kid free days, but I’m just as disappointed and I really don’t feel like I’ve done anything wrong in this situation.

I (14f, and yes I know I’m young) have recently encountered a disagreement with my mom concerning my choice of clothing at home.
When I’m at home, I sometimes walk around the house dressed quite casually in a t shirt or hoodie and my panties. It’s not like I have dinner in these clothes but I wear them if I’m just making myself a sandwich or fetching something from another room to my room. 
Anyway, I have done this since I was little.
But recently my mom told me that I have to stop and start wearing more ”appropriate clothing” around the house and that I’m too big to do this.
I’m quite upset because I dont exactly do this when we have guests and why should my own family (mom, dad, brother) care?

&#x200B;

I put stealing in quotes because my mom insists it's stealing, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

&#x200B;

So basically, my family goes to this restaurant called Sweet Tomatoes every once in a while, where you pay about $30, and from there it's all you can eat. It's self serve, with a lot of different divisions where you can just get what you want. The waiters/waitresses don't really do much, they just collect your plate once it gets dirty.

&#x200B;

And in the dessert section, there are some fruits...sliced oranges, sliced lemons, sliced strawberries, grapes, and...for some reason, whole entire apples.

&#x200B;

And right before leaving, my dad always picks two apples and sticks it in his cargo shorts pockets before leaving. My mom insists it's tacky as hell, but he does it anyway.

&#x200B;

I thought about maybe also ""stealing apples"" as well so we have some extra ones at home...but a part of me told me it was kind of tacky, and my mom seems to think so as well...but is it tacky, really...is my dad the asshole here?

Basically I’ve been friends with my best friend for four years. We are going to colleges on opposite sides of the US in a month and I’m barely going to ever see her again. I took her to my family vacation with me in the beginning of June just so I could see her more. On Saturday she started dating someone that she met at a coffee shop that same day and I haven’t seen her all week. Whenever I ask her to hang out she says “I’m with ____ right now.” I asked if they were planning on doing a long distance relationship and she said that no, it was just a summer fling. She asked me to hang out on Tuesday of next week so that she could “give me the tea on her new boy.”  She sometimes hangs out with other people when they’re on a date, and she’s offered me to come with them once, but I don’t want to be a third wheel especially to a guy I’ve never met.

c6vl07	2019-06-29 06:36:04	PrancingPeach	AITA for honking at someone blocking traffic in a parking lot so they could wait for a spot to open?	"So it’s a little hard to explain this situation purely verbally, but I’ll try as best I can. I pulled into the parking lot of this very busy strip center where there are a bunch of restaurants. My GF and I knew going in we may not find parking and we were just sort of cruising around looking for something if we got lucky.

As soon as we’re in the parking lot, we encounter two cars side by side completely blocking traffic in either direction. We can’t really figure out what they’re doing. Possibly they were in some sort of stalemate for a spot, but nobody parked seemed to be leaving. Meanwhile 3-4 other cars are now behind me, so I’m completely blocked in.

A few minutes pass and one of the two cars finally drives off, but the one in front of me stays parked. It’d been a while and it’s obvious there’s no one parked who’s about to pull out. Instead this person is literally just parked in the middle of the parking lot waiting for someone to walk to their car and leave. I can’t get around because I’m blocked by the car behind me, who’s blocked by the car behind them, etc. Besides, going around would be tough even if I wasn’t blocked because there are a number of cars going the opposite direction. This also was right at the corner in the parking lot and I had no visibility of cars coming around the corner.

Eventually I make some light courtesy honks indicating this person needs to start moving because they’ve blocked 4-5 cars (including me) and there could easily be a spot somewhere else in this rather large strip center. When I do this the driver gives me a dirty look through his rear view mirror and then gives me a thumbs up, which I don’t know how to interpret but it certainly comes off as passive aggressive. It’s clear he has no intention of moving.

I started losing my temper and honked a lot more aggressively. He absolutely refused to budge. At one point I laid my horn on him for probably a solid 5-10 seconds at least, but he did nothing but sit there and glare at me through his rear view mirror. This naturally got the attention of passers by who looked at both of us probably trying to interpret what was going on.

Finally someone walked to a car nearby in front of him and pulled out. He pulled into the spot pretty much as slowly as he could with me honking at him the entire time.

I feel like I overreacted, and I virtually never lay my horn on someone unless safety is at risk, but I also don’t think I’ve ever encountered someone who absolutely refused to move right in the middle of a busy parking lot when there wasn’t even a spot opening up."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6vku9	2019-06-29 06:35:29	throwmeinthetrash66	WIBTA for inserting myself into an argument between my mom and step dad when he keeps insulting her and me?	"So I'm currently 27. My mom is going through a divorce from my step father. I also have a 16 year old half brother from that marriage. My mom met her husband when i was maybe 8 so I've known him basically for 20 years.

After the first couple years of their marriage, he became extremely verbally abusive. He would yell at everyone over nothing, insult us for tiny things, break things, on a couple occasions he's pushed my mom, and he physically attacked me when i was 18 and called him out for being an asshole. I've also since been in one other fist fight with him.

Anyways he's moved out of the house and is still in the process of grabbing some things, so he comes by and talks to my mom frequently. I hear my mom argue with him and hang up when he turns to the insult game in seconds for no reason. Today, he texted both my mom and my brother a bunch of nasty shit. He has some strange vendetta with me because he keeps insulting me to them even though i have nothing to do with anything going on. He insulted me multiple times today and also brought my fiance into it today.

I know a big handful of things that would really hurt him. Things i could say about himself that would really cut him to the core. Things he doesn't want to hear or think about. *Real* insults and not thee mindless curse words he throws around.

I'm tired of him insulting me, my fiance, my mom, and (sometimes) my brother. The next time he goes off, WIBTA if i inserted myself and texted/called him to say what i had to say? I admit it would make his rage worse in the moment but I'm sick of being a bystander. It's my mom's husband and my brother's dad so it would probably make that particular argument worse for them at the moment, but i feel entitled to say things because he was my step dad for 20 years and i can't insert myself if he's already inserting my into his arguments."

She took it pretty roughly as she struggled to have children. However, after few years she got pregnant and now has two beautiful daughters.
She celebrates the anniversary of stillbirth with a handful of Facebook photos every year, as well as in between of those. Two days ago, it was the 7th anniversary and she posted a series of very distressing photos of the deceased child straight after the labour. the photos are very gruesome, etc the child with their mouth opened laying lifeless. The photos are very upsetting and triggering, also my older sister experienced a still birth over a decade ago and photos like that could only bring back the hurtful experience to those who see them.
I am not thinking about her sense of privacy or decorum, I'm just thinking strictly about the fact that the photos are very upsetting and should not be shared for everyone's view on Facebook.

c6vji2	2019-06-29 06:30:53	captncrunchpp	AITA for asking for my money back to my girlfriend?	"So, I've been with my girlfriend for around 4 years now and our relationship is very good, you can call it the ""She may be the one"".

Everything is good with except in one area... Sex. We barely do anything, maybe barely do it once a month and realistically I don't have a problem with it. The reason we don't do it as frequently it's because of some trauma she has from a few years back and I try to respect it and be empathetic. 

But, when we decide to have sex, we usually go to a motel and have to be prepared with a lot of things, that can stack up to $100 dlls per visit. 

The problem is that when she has an episode and gets scared, even without me doing anything, we have to call everything off, and everything goes to waste or has to be saved for another time. Usually I don't mind this, because we split the bill, but for the last year, I've been paying everything for Everytime we decide to go to an motel. Recently I've changed my job, and try to spend a little less on the dates so I can afford taking her out as well as spending on my things. Also, she has a better job than me, and makes way more, the only reason I pay for everything it's because she gets embarrassed from buying the things we need. 
So, in the last 4-5 months she has been having those episodes and ending up doing anything and has racked up to a significant amount.

I've been thinking about telling her that from this point forward, if she has an episode, she has to pay for everything; not because I don't want to support her, but because I get frustrated of ending the night like that and not being able to enjoy some other things that I may want for me, just because she wanted to have sex, but couldn't go through with it.

c6vgr6	2019-06-29 06:21:25		AITA For Not Wanting My Friends To Skip My Music??	"My friends and I have made a playlist in the past to listen to while we drive or just chill. There are 5 of us and we all get to add 20 songs to play on shuffle. A couple months ago we were playing from the playlist and one of my songs came on, to which on of my friends, who was in the drivers seat promptly switched to the next song.--For context we all listen to quite different music and I had added a screamo song from my emo phase when I was 14. I didn't expect others to like it but I assumed it was about adding songs we individually liked.--at the time I was pretty pissed but like we joke around a lot so I just laughed it off. But one of my friends said we couldn't do that anymore so I kinda forgot about it.

Currently, we're planning a trip to Niagara Falls in July and again we made a playlist for the 4 hour drive. We were chilling around my friends pool, listening to music from the playlist and one of my songs came on that was a mix of screamo and trap and again someone promptly skipped it.

 This started an argument between me and all 4 of them. I mentioned that we had agreed months ago that we cannot skip songs. To which all of them responded that everyone would get ""1 skip"" (meaning everyone can choose at least once to skip a song) but we could also get ""1 block"" (meaning like someone could block a skip?? I'm not too sure. It all seems very immature to me). I pointed out that considering they all only skip my songs they would all most likely use all their ""skips"" on my songs to which I could only ""block"" one which was pretty unfair to me. 

For perspective here are some points they brought up as to why they should be able to skip songs:
* They added songs that everyone would like (imo that isn't particularly true at all. My friend who was very passionate about being able to skip through my songs, half of her selection were songs no one knew and another added a bunch of Disney and Broadway songs) 
* They can't focus while driving
* If no one else likes it them it's selfish of me to play it.


I got pretty irate about it all and just deleted all my songs off the playlist. I see no point of adding my songs if they're juat going to skip through it. I understand that not everyone likes it, but I don't like a lot of music that they do, but I happily sit through it because I know they like it. 

There was really no resolution but as to not make it awkward I just dropped it. Later on that day we played the newlywed game and one of the questions were ""if your partner could name one thing about you they dislike what would it be"" I guessed it would be my tardiness but my friend said it was actually my stubbornness, to which of course everyone agreed with. I asked how I was stubborn but they all just giggled and wouldn't answer. I am pretty sure it's over the music situation.

So I guess my question is less of if I'm the asshole but if I'm being childish and stubborn about this whole thing?? Thoughts??"		1	0

c6vd8l	2019-06-29 06:09:30	Straight_Example	WIBTA if I pursue a friendship with a guy my boyfriend says is attracted to me?	"I know it sounds damning but hear me out. Obligatory made a new account to not have this on my main. 

One of my friends has a friend, let's call him D, that I've met a few times at one of her social gatherings and I've always gotten along with him. She's recently had a few social things at her place, and D has been there. The last few gatherings I've been to I've also taken my bf and he's met D. 

The most recent time I saw D, we were really getting along, we have a similar sense of humour and shit talking about life in general. I was having a good time, but I didn't spend the entire time with D. My bf was socialising with me, but also mingling with others as well. D and I had a few drinks so we were being a bit more animated than usual, and I did notice he was being a bit extra friendly. Nothing terribly forward, just extra friendly but no physical contact whatsoever.

My bf made mention of this on the drive back to our place. A side note:  my bf really isn't the jealous type, he's a pretty laid back guy in general about this sort of thing. At the time, he said something along the lines of ""you were getting a bit of extra attention there tonight, I was feeling a little bit jealous"" but some prying at the time didn't reveal who he was talking about (as there were a few guy acquaintances I chatted with that evening). It came up in conversation a few days later, and my bf says ""D is clearly attracted to you"". However, he didn't say anything like he was weirded out by it, or that he was jealous, just that it was obvious. 

I myself am not too sure. I've known D since before I met my bf, and knew him while I was single, and he never showed any interest in me (to be fair, he may not have known I was single at the time). I think that more likely, because this was perhaps the fourth or fifth time I've talked to D, he has realised we had a lot in common and because of the alcohol, may have been a bit extra friendly and animated with me. I'm not necessarily thinking he 100% wants to bone me - he was also friendly with my bf, and they were getting along, and as I said, nothing really out of the ordinary happened. 

Even if he WAS attracted to me, I'm not sure if that rules him out as a potential friend? I'm not attracted to him myself, if that helps. I just think we would get along as friends. I'm also in a position where I am on the market for new friends... my bf and I have had conversations about how my current friend circle is a bit depressing at the moment. So if I meet someone I get along with, I'm definitely wanting to pursue it.

Anyway... the reason I bring all this up is that I saw a funny meme that reminded me of my conversation with D last time we hung out, and I wanted to link it to him and sort of spark up a conversation. Considering my bf's comments about D though, I'm wondering if I will be TA if I pursue a friendship with this guy?"	No A-holes here	0	0

I’m not a salesperson but I’m a person who greets everyone and qualifies them (ask how they are, how can I help, what are you looking for etc) before they look through the display home. I usually say “hey guys” when I first greet them or maybe further in the convo I will say “How did you guys find us” or something like that. I do this when it’s more than one person coming through (husband and wife, family etc). 

I recently was made aware by one of the sales people that callings everyone “guys” may not only be unprofessional but also somewhat sexist; as it may be perceived as sexist as “guys” is generally associated with males. I’ve never had anyone customer or anyone else in my life say anything about this or have made it an issue. I understand that it may be a problem however, and I’ll try and make a conscious effort to stop, but I have never felt this word highlights anything sexist or demoralising.

Aita because I was with a girl for about 5 months then she broke up with me. 3 DAYS later my exs best friend starts messaging me asking if I'm okay and just the usual shit like that (She messaged me every day it just wasn't until 3 days after I replied). She kept messaging me and 5 days after having broken up then asked me if I wanted to go to the movies. She was making me feel better about it all and I was pretty weakened so I said yeah sure. We went and had a good time doing whatever it is you do at the movies. WATCHED A MOVIE, DIDN'T KISS. The next day my ex starts causing all sort of shit because apparently I'd gotten with her best friend kissed her and just dumb shit. While she was doing all this me and the exs best friend (I'll call H from now on) were on a call just to try and crush this shit because the rumors were about both of us. That day H ended up coming to my place and but the end of it we had started doing the shit we were accused of(Basically just kissing) and by the end of that day we decided up get together because we actually had a connection. I was still kind of weak at this time. Through all this H made the first moves for everything and she was the one who asked to get together. So I ended up getting with my exs best friend and of nut two best friends one says I was the shit causing cunt and the other says i was in the right as long as I ""got in a good fuck"" but then there's also family saying ex dumped me so I was fair game.

c6v8ls	2019-06-29 05:54:20	PupCakes22	AITA For not wanting to move out with my now Ex-Friend?	"My husband and I wanted to move out because my sister just had a baby and she needed our room for her baby. We decided we need a roommate so the rent is cheaper, He invited our mate from work. My friend overheard it and said it would be cheaper if we all move in a house, we got all excited and so we started to plan everything.

It went downhill for me when she started telling us what she wanted:
1. She preferably want a house.
2. She wants her own bathroom (which was optional)
3. She wanted a place near her second job
4. She needs to move out as soon as possible so she wants us to find a place in a few weeks.

She was the only one who had a second job, she tells us that she is too busy from working and so she wanted us to call all the places possible. However, every time we find a place she would find something she doesnt like about it. We would have disagreements, mostly about the rent. She shows us pictures of houses she wants but it was always way out of our budget and if we didnt want to go look at a place because it was expensive she would say something along the lines of  ""I am so tired from my other job at least i'm willing to do this for us""

The last straw was when she told us in our group chat that we should move out without her just because she had an argument with our other friend. But when he apologized she replied a few hours later like nothing happened, saying she was acting like that just because she was exhausted and stressed. When we said we didnt want to move with them anymore and we hoped to not take it personally because just recently my husband and I heard the news from his sister that she is sick and we might visit her often and that would be difficult to do if we pay rent. She said that we flaked on her and that she sacrificed her sleep and wasted her time. She also said that we knew she had a deadline and she felt disappointed in us that we did not tell her sooner. Lastly, she texted me basically saying she didnt want to be friends anymore and that all good things must come to an end (whatever that means)

We also all work together so whenever she sees us she avoids us, I also have a feeling that she talks about us behind our backs and makes us look like we we abandoned her, which was proven correct because we have mutual friends at work that told me about it."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6v8ah	2019-06-29 05:53:23	MyNameIsBlurp	AITA for removing idle items in a sleeping quarter?	"I can't think of a title that completely summarizes what i did but here's the story:

&#x200B;

So in our company, we have a room with 8 beds which is the sleeping quarters (there's no limitation on the duration of the sleep). My situation is that the distance of my company and my house is so far away that if i were to travel point to point, i will only get 4 to 6 hours of sleep, so i decided to have a bag full of clothes that will suffice my needs from Monday to Friday and basically i'll work and sleep within the company. So, with this in mind, i'm not the only person that is doing this. Every time i want to sleep, i always wait for other people to wake up because the rule is first come first serve basis.

My issue here is there's **always** 2 or 3 persons who leaves their bags and blankets in their bed; while, they are working. So they will come back 7 or 8 hours after their shift was done and sleep in their bed.

One time, I got fed up with their 'technique' that I decided to neatly remove their bags and blankets to the side of the bed and I'll sleep in the bed. So while i was in a middle of sleeping, a person that came back from their shift, woke me up and told me that i was an asshole for taking up his bed and he justifies it that he was the first person to put their bag in that bed.

With this, AITA for doing that? I did that because i was really sleepy and that they are not actually sleeping and they reserved it with their bags.

I know the story sounds childish but there are people who are bothered with what they are doing and I just want to step up with their technique.  


Edit: Hi everyone! For more info, all the beds were already occupied by a human being and 2 to 3 beds were reserved by a bag or their clothes. I'll actually email and raise a formal request on the matter with our HR team for them to check and update their rules on this as sometimes there are people waiting beside the room and they can't sleep because the beds has been reserved by the bags.

c6v85g	2019-06-29 05:52:52		AITA for asking my brother to split the cost of flowers for Mother's Day	"I always send my Mom flowers on Mother's Day and thought that maybe my brother would like to get in on the present to make Mom feel special. To be honest, I doubt he has ever given her a gift for Mother's day on his own. So I text him and ask if he would like to split the cost of flowers and he says yes. I take my time and find a really nice florist in her area. Normally when I send her flowers I spend about $100 so I saw this beautiful arrangement with a very nice vase, since she just bought a new house I wanted something that she would like to display. With delivery and tax the total was $140. I send my  bro a pic of the arrangement and price with a message that I balled out for mom a bit but she is worth it. Mom gets the flowers and loves them, sends mutiple pics over 2 weeks thanking us. Well a week goes by and I haven't heard anything so I send him a venmo request, still nothing. We are both close to our Mom so I vent to my mom a bit (I know, big mistake) because honestly my feelings are hurt that he is ignoring me. My mom says he probably just forgot or didnt see the Venmo request. I tell my mom not to say anything. A couple weeks later we are on the phone and I say I can't believe my brother has not responded to  me at all. Well mom confesses that she talked to him about it because she wants him to do the right thing. Then she tells me that he is mad at me because he thinks that $140 is a totally outrages price for flowers and that I chose such an expensive arrangement to fuck with him. LOL the fuck??? Then she tells me he even wanted to post it on reddit. I sent him a message  letting him know that it is hurtful that he is ignoring me and that I don't care about the money. If he didn't want to go in on the gift he could have said no, If he didnt have the money he could just ask to pay me later, he could have said he felt it was too expensive and contributed an amount he felt was reasonable. Still no response from him. Not that it matters but I try to be sensitive to others financials and I would never ask an amount from someone that I think would be out of their budget or create a hardship

c6v739	2019-06-29 05:49:21	Fluomby	AITA for telling my neighbour he has to close his window when watching TV after 10pm?	"A bit of information first:

\- I live in a studio appartment in an appartment complex (consisting of mostly studio appartments)

\- I am a university student.

\- We are currently having a heat wave.

\- I have an exam today which I have been preparing for for about two months, including going to the library for 8-12 hours every day for the last two weeks. 

&#x200B;

So, this happened yesterday evening. I was getting ready to go to bed quite early, because I know I have trouble falling asleep when I'm nervous. Thus I am lying in my bed at around 10pm, but was awake until about 11:30, when I finally start feeling tired and falling asleep. Since it was cooling down a little during the night, I was sleeping with my window open. Cue my upstairs neighbour turning on his TV and loudly laughing - which means I am now wide awake again. 

Now, this isn't the first time this happened. I had complained to him last year, when the same thing occured also in the night before an exam, and I have complained to him twice the last week (both times it was close to midnight). First time I just shouted through my open window, worked for the night, he closed his. Second time I actually went upstairs and talked to him. I remained friendly and explained that I had an exam this week and asked if he could please close his window. Worked like a charm for two days. Until yesterday. When he did the same thing again.

Now, since this exam is important I didn't hesitate very long in going upstairs and complaining. I was quite angry at that point, because I knew I wouldn't get a lot of sleep that night. So we had a bit of an agitated conversation, I reminded him that I have this stupid exam tomorrow, and he just asks my why I don't close my window (because it's damn hot and I can't sleept when my apartment is like 35°C, duh). He replied that he was hot as well, to which I said that I thought that if he was the one making noise, he should close his window. He wasn't having that and argued he would just turn the volume down.

This was all I could get him to agree to, so I went back downstairs, hoping I could sleep now. It was past midnight at this point and instead of tired I was now wide awake and sweating. And I could still hear this TV. This was the point where I lost my patience. Trough my open window I shouted something along the lines of: ""I have been preparing for this f\* exam for two months now, and if I fail tomorrow because of you, you're hearing from house managment."" It was quiet after that. I fell asleep around 1:30.

I am seriously considering writing to house managment anyway, because I have my first state examination coming up in August and I am done dealing with this.

&#x200B;

Now, the all important question: Am I the asshole and should just close my window or deal with it?


Edit: Regarding the volume: I was able to understand what he was watching. I could also hear his TV when walking up to his appartment door. He literally said he would turn it down to “room volume”, which it by law would have to be after 10pm. Also, the way our apartments are constructed, the window bits “protrude” from the rest of the building, meaning if you open a window, sound gets reflected on your neighbours “protruding” windows, which is also probably a reason why I hear it so clearly in my appartment.

Edit: I have to occasionally work at the hospital due to my education. This means getting up at 4:30 in the morning. Now, i absolutely love to listen to music and watch the news in the morning, but it never even occured to me to do that at 4:30, because I knew other people were sleeping. I don’t see the difference to his behaviour."	Asshole	0	0

It started when we lived right by each other, but then I went off for a gap year, we missed each other and talked a lot. Then, I came back, we had a week together and hung around each other constantly. He had a girlfriend during that time. I then moved after that week was over, and we went straight into calling and texting constantly, missing each other. He broke up with that girlfriend, and we fell out of frequent contact as well. Then, he got a new girlfriend, and a couple months after, just last week, he came to visit me and my family while I’m home from college. He gets along with everyone and the family but me and him talk by far the most. We would stay up all night talking together alone. He and his girlfriend are long distance and barely even talk. When he left a couple days ago, we’ve been texting and calling constantly late into the night. I’d love to say there’s nothing romantic but it’s pretty obvious there is.

c6v35w	2019-06-29 05:36:47	Nizmy_	AITA for getting free hairdos?	"So this isn't me but a friend. My mom owns a hair salon and is really good at what she does. A couple of months ago a friend of mine was hanging out with me and my mom and they were talking about hair. I'm not sure who offered/asked but somehow she agreed to do his hair for him for free.

 After this, he would periodically text/call me or my mom to ask for more free haircuts. He is always super nice and flexible about it and is never rude. One day I said that he should start paying my mom or going somewhere else even though he always does it when she has absolutely no other people in there.

We got into a very calm argument about how it was messed up because he wasn't paying and was taking up her time, I told him if she offered it was ok but he shouldn't be asking. He said that since nobody else was there that it was ok but I said someone may walk by and not give her business because they see that he is in there and that there will be a wait.   

It is important to know that my mom knows him well enough to where she will likely say yes every time she isn't busy."	No A-holes here	0	0

We hit it off and after a few dates we became official. She’s probably the most beautiful person I’ve met, but I didn’t like her just for her beauty, she’s smart and has a great personality and I just love talking to her.

One thing about her is that she enjoys extreme biking a lot and doing tricks on her bike. I tell her to be careful with it but it’s what she loves and in the end I had to support her. 

A few months ago, while biking down a steep slope, videoing some trick she had wanted to post online, apparently something goes wrong with her brakes and she loses balance and falls face first on the rough concrete. She breaks her nose and suffers really bad injuries and has to go for facial reconstruction surgery.

When she came back and after the healing process, she didn’t look the same. She told me she knew I couldn’t love her again because she wasn’t pretty, so I made it my mission to make her as confident as possible and convince her I didn’t care and just wanted to be with her.  Needless to say, she really appreciated this and told me how much she loved me.

Fast forward a few months and I honestly have begun to lose interest. I know looks shouldn’t matter and that her personality should shine through but honestly they do. She’s also begun to notice that I’ve stopped kissing her and don’t ask for sex as often as I used to. I mean, I try to keep it hidden, but I think she’s starting to know I’m losing my attraction to her.

c6uwix	2019-06-29 05:16:09	unicorn_345	AITA for requesting/demanding my adult sister shut both bathroom doors?	"Ok it sounds simple, it’s a bathroom door. But it’s not exposed to much. We live in an older style trailer/modular home and one of the bathrooms has two doors, one to the main part of the house and one to the utility room. For reference we’re both adults, she’s never left, I’m trying to get on my feet again. There’s a 10 yr old sister here and dad is at home. We frequently watch the almost 4 yr old nephew. 

I’ve repeatedly asked her to shut the door that goes to the utility room as it also houses the trash bin the whole household uses. It’s frequently almost shut when she is using the bathroom. The 10 yr old girl has taken to leaving the door wide open and points out that the other sister leaves it open. The almost 4 yr old nephew is free to generally wander but he’s getting a bit old to walk in on ppl using the restroom. I’ve taken to shutting the door when I throw stuff away and asking about once a week that she shut that door. It’s not always the nicest but we’re talking at least two dozen times I’ve asked so I’m a bit irate about it. 

So to argue her side relatively fairly. It’s a bit of a “cesspool” as the trash bin is on that side as well as the cat litter. So it’s not like excess bacteria is floating about because she leaves the door open. It’s not “wide open” is a favorite argument. And sometimes she’s “in a rush”. I still don’t comprehend how several times weekly (idk the # honestly)is a rush and not just being too lazy to go when you need to and not stalling. This sister still pees her pants sometimes and she’ll have been home for hrs and just didn’t get up to go. (Not fair but it has come up as recently as today that sometimes she’s “in a rush.”) She claims that it isn’t that often that someone could see the open door, yet I close it several times a week. 

My side. I’m closing it several times a week. Not slamming it, but it does sound loud because it’s only open a few inches so it seems to sound louder. Not being kind about it and trying to be dead silent. She has been known to leave it open when guests are over. Dad has complained. Mom had complained. The 10 yr old is taking up the behavior. The almost 4 yr old doesn’t understand yet but he’s getting there. It would simply be good order and discipline to shut the door to the bathroom one is using.

c6uu9i	2019-06-29 05:09:31	Turqouisemoon	AITA for covering a roommates part of the rent, and asking for it back 3 months later? Wanting another roommates gf to go home for at least a few days out of the week?	Me and my husband and 4 friends decided it would be a good idea to rent a huge house together to help save money and reach our goals with schooling or a certain career. We all worked hard to get into this house. It’s been 3 months and we’re happy with the arrangement, there’s plenty of space and privacy for all of us. The problem is one of our roommates lost his job about a week before we all moved in together. Me and husband suggested that he work with us at our job. Pay is decent and stable, he can use us as a reference.  Roommate didn’t want the job, said it was too far. A month later, rent is due. We all had to pitch in to cover his part. We paid $145 for his part, the others put in too. He never acknowledged that we had to pay for him, not even a thank you. That’s fine, at least rent was paid. He finally found a job a week later. We saw that he was starting to go out with friends, he even took a trip to LA. He always has money for cigarettes and beer. My husband asked him for the money back. He told us that he’s broke and struggling to feed himself and that he’s already making payments to another roommate that paid his way to get into the house. Fine, but $20 here and there would’ve been cool...but he never attempted to pay us a dime all this time. The roommate that helped him get in, jumped in and defended him. Telling us that he’s trying..and it’s not a big deal...of course, he’s getting his money back! So me and husband were made to look insensitive and demanding. Were we in the wrong?? Another situation in the house is that a completely different roommate met a girl a couple of months ago. His car broke down so she offered to pick him up for work. She was introduced to us one day when she stopped by to pick him up for work. A few days later, she started staying the night here and there. Cool....no problem. Soon, it increased to 3-5 times a week. Now, this girl won’t go home! It’s been 2 months. She’s here when I get up for work in the morning, she’s here when I go to bed at night. She basically moved in without speaking to any of us about it. She cooks, showers and does her laundry here. I didn’t sign up for another roommate. She even took my parking spot in the driveway so roommate can work on her car. Her presence doesn’t take up a lot of space, but still...she’s living here for free and didn’t discuss it with anyone. I’m tempted to say something, but don’t want another roommate mad at us. So I say nothing while silently fuming. None of the other roommates seem to care. I’m the only one that’s furious about this.

Sooo, I'm really in to tabletop RPGs, and my friend is a budding artist. I talked with her a few months ago to commission a drawing of my character. She said it would be about $35 for what I wanted. I agreed, and we started the process of bringing my character to life.

She just sent me the picture and said it would be $150, which is more than I expected, and more than I can afford. I love it, and I know she worked hard on it. WIBTA to ask her to meet me somewhere in the middle???"	Not the A-hole	0	0

c6um48	2019-06-29 04:45:22	xxxCUNT_DESTROYERxxx	WIBTA if I asked my roommates to tell me in advance when they want to use my TV?	"So I am honestly not trying to come off as the asshole here, let me explain why.

For the past few months I've started working out and I take it very seriously. I'm working out 5 times per week and have a structure routine I am doing. Now, I live in an apartment with 3 other college guys. When we were moving in, we didn't have a TV so they all asked and I said fine, I'll go get one for us. I primarily got it because i like to play RPGs after I get back from a day at work, but I figured I didn't want to be an asshole and keep it in my room, so I said I'll put it in the living room and you guys can use it.

So the problem is: I get back from work. The first thing I do is workout, then get back and shower. Then go to dinner, then get back, At this point there's about an hour before I should get to bed but there is almost always somebody watching a movie, so I don't get to use the TV that I own.

So I am thinking of 2 solutions: WIBTA, or which would be better, for either of the following

1) Have a sign up sheet. You can use my TV whenever you want, but let me know a day in advance. This way, I know when to plan my night (ie when to workout, eat, etc.) to leave an hour for myself to play xbox. I will schedule myself around whenever you want to use it

2) Tell them the TV is mine from 10-11:00 because I own it, other than that you can use it whenever

3) This is for a future option. It seems like it is too late now (correct me if I'm wrong), but in a future scenario with roommates who ask for a TV: Don't put it in the living room and keep it for myself

&#x200B;

Which would be the least asshole way to handle this? I feel that since I paid for it, I should get to use it, if you want a TV you can either do 1) or 2) or buy your own."	No A-holes here	0	0

c6ukoz	2019-06-29 04:41:19	Hope_bringer	AITA for saying to get something cheap?	"Okay this happened a while back, but I’m still kinda debating over how well I handled the situation.

I have a friend who was thinking about buying a gaming laptop since his old one had an utterly fried motherboard. So throughout the course of around 6 months, I scoured all available information about some good gaming laptops for a good price. Of course he said his budget would be 1 grand, but he wanted a laptop with a great screen, GTX 1060 6GB, a new generation I-7 and at least 1 terabyte hard drive. And with those minimum stuff, you’d be looking at a laptop between 1.3k to 2.2K. So that made my search much much harder. I was wondering why he wanted something that strong since all he played was terraria and overwatch, things that don’t require a lot of resources to run ( overwatch is heavily optimized and doesn’t need as much resources as other games of its release), he told me that he just wants it so it could “last longer” which doesn’t make much sense since the life of a gaming GPU and CPU are consistent between generations, and having all that extra power leads to energy loss due to the immense power of those parts, and not maintaining it like that will decrease its life a lot. So I found something good for like 959 USD and it had most of the same specs he wanted, BUT, the GPU was a GTX 1060 3GB, he said ew to the 3gb version. Here I’m thinking “he’s joking right? You don’t need all that power”, so I tell him, “it’s fine cause its cheaper”. Ooooooh boy did he not like me saying cheaper. He gets ticked off and starts saying that “I don’t believe in him to get that money” and “it hurts my pride to hear you say that”, meanwhile I’m like, “dude, you have zero need for that kind of strength, why do you want to get something so high end while you barely have enough money for food. You ask me for cash when you’re hungry” course I “clapped back at him” (weird slang but I think it fits) and I feel justified talking back to him. Though after I did feel bad because I felt like I reacted too harshly. When I told the rest of my friends they all said he was being a huge asshole and one of them said “just get your money back dude omfg he shouldn’t do that to you” (thanks surprisebitch on tumblr, you’re the best). But yeah, am I really the asshole for saying the word cheap while hunting for a gaming laptop on my own time?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6uklp	2019-06-29 04:41:04		WIBTA for coming out to my parents to get disowned when it's convenient for me	"context: i'm lesbian, and my parents are very much openly homophobic. i know it's not safe to openly come out yet, and i accept that.

i already have a plan for college/uni: my father promised he will help me pay my tuition and i'll take a few loans if needed. i'll live with them as i'm going to school, so living fees are also covered. when i get a stable job and my own place, i'll come out to my parents (and i'm 100% sure it will end in my disownment, as my father has explicitly stated before.)

here's the problem: if i stick to this plan, i'd basically be using my parents for money and stable living conditions. it's not just that, my father constantly talks about him and i working together after i graduate, but if we do that, then i won't be able to have a love-life due to him and i always being around each other.

i really love my parents; they're both very hardworking and i would feel like a dick for using them for their money and then basically leaving. but, at the same time, i try to justify my feelings by saying that they don't really love me if they'd disown me for something out of my control.

&#x200B;

i feel like this is an 'esh' situation but what do you guys say?

&#x200B;

EDIT: i would like to edit this to add one more thing: i fully intend on paying my parents back. they've spent a lot of money on me and paying for my uni will be a sacrifice on their behalf, so when i do get back on my feet, i completely intend to pay them back by sending them money. unfortunately, if i do come out i doubt they'd accept my money, but i'll try regardless.

and thank you for all your responses."	Not the A-hole	0	0
c6uj8h	2019-06-29 04:37:10	RareSpeech	WIBTA if I had my husband adopt my son, even though my son doesn't want it?	"My first husband passed away when my older kids were 3 months old and 5 years old. It was a difficult time of course and pretty traumatic for myself. It also scared me, because I was the only person left for my kids and I worried what would happen to them if I died. I have some family, but none that I’d feel super confident caring for them in the event that it happened. It was a serious anxiety I ended up having to see someone about.

A few years later, I met my current husband. He’s an amazing man, and he loves my kids. He’s the only dad my daughter has ever knows, though we’ve told her about my late husband. My son loves him, though he doesn’t call him “dad” which we were totally fine with and told him that. He was older than his sister when his dad died and their relationships were totally different.

Now that we’ve added to our family, my husband has asked about officially adopting my older kids, including my son. My daughter accepted, she’s called him “Daddy” since she was 4 years old so it’s just making it official. My son (now 12) is saying no.

He says while he loves his step-dad, he doesn’t want to be adopted. Despite us explaining it’s not replacing his dad, he doesn’t feel right about it. I’ve explained to him why it matters so much to me. If I died, I’d want his step-dad to be able to take care of him like he does now. My son says he’d want it too, but he doesn’t want anything to legally change. We’ve tried to make compromises, like telling him that we won’t change his last name so it’ll stay the same as his dad’s, that all it is, is a piece of paper and a just in case, etc. But he says that it still feels disrespectful to his dad.

The truth is, I know my mom would try to take my older kids from my husband and make a stink about it, if anything were to happen to me. I have a will, but it could be contested. I want to make sure that everything is legal. I feel the same anxieties popping up again.

c6uhqc	2019-06-29 04:32:41		WIBTA if I filed a noise complaint against my neighbours?	"So a few weeks ago some people moved in directly across the street from me. Since they’ve moved in they’ve thrown several parties and in general just make constant noise. 

There’s always 6+ cars in their drive way that make a lot of noise. So far, in the past week, at random hours of the day/night multiple people will get into the cars and start honking the horns/revving the engines and blast very loud music. 

The people they invite over show up at around noon, then consistently scream, laugh and shout until early hours of the morning. It’s honestly insane how much energy these people have. It also happens on weekdays, not just weekends.  I can begin to hear the loud laughter and screaming at around 11:30am then it progressively gets louder until 3:00am where they begin to mellow out. But at this time everyone is leaving, so there’s still car doors slamming and horns honking. 

I’m so fucking sick of it. It’s only been a month with having them live there and myself, as well as all of my roommates, despise them. They’re so fucking loud and obnoxious. 

Tonight is worse than all of the other ones. They are all screaming at the top of their lungs, playing very loud music from their cars, honking the horn and lighting fireworks. They also have dogs that keep barking and howling. It’s so loud and frustrating. I need to be up at 4:30am to go to work and can’t sleep with these people making so much noise (even with the windows closed).

I'm 20f
unsure what to make the title. 
my first post on here so I'm hoping I do this right  

so I delt with a shitty ex boyfriend that left mental scars that have never heald. 

I've done counseling before and its kinda helped me. one thing that I do is I will act like a 13 year old, it happens every now and then. I never notice that I'm doing it but I've been told that I do it. 

i can skip around, and complain just like a teenager. just as I was heading to the bathroom I decided to skip there instead of walk and I kept around like a kid. 
imagine a 13 year old, thats how I act, it's super annoying to explain so hopefully i did my best. 

because I don't notice i do it I started to freak out my 2 roommates who think its creepy and hate me doing it. 

one of them hates being around me when I do it and has been telling me i HAVE to see a counselor.

I said that i eventually would have to go home because im not the type to party all night, which she seemed to understand.  


Fast forward to when we meet up, we are hanging out with my friends, at a bar and she is getting close to me, grabbing my arm all the time, hugging me and that already is getting me uncomfortable. It got to the point that we made out.  


Now im uncomfortable as fuck and already thinking how to get away. We drive to another spot and there is even more people and people that i know, and she is acting like we just got married.  
I say to her that i need to go because my friend got in trouble and needed urgent help and turns out that she doesn't have a place to stay...  


We stand there for 10 minutes while she calls her friend who doesn't pick up. I offered her taxi money to whatever place she can stay or whatever help i can give to get her to a place to stay, but she says that there are no options.  
I would have offered to stay at my place but for reasons that isn't possible.  
Eventually i leave, and she text's me that she found a place to stay at some guys hostel.

We are very close and although the long distance thing is hard, we are making it work. My sister's husband's friend who we have met once or twice during the wedding is visiting my city and asked to visit during some day. I said yes (I love hosting people here) and immediately offered for him to stay the night, and leave in the morning.

My girlfriend found out just before leaving to visit, and is pissed that he is staying the one night. She says it will be weird and she'd rather stay somewhere else for that night, and now is thinking she may do her own thing that day. Right now, our finances are separate so I pay my own rent and paid for her flight. She is visiting while her company is shut down, so besides opportunities, she isn't missing out on a lot by visiting for the week.

Side: arguably, I am more close with him than she is, but not by anything significant.

c6uadv	2019-06-29 04:11:11	Twerk7	WIBTA if I took actions against my girlfriend’s stalker.	"I’m 25. My gf is 24. She’s from Russia and we met in college overseas. She’s in Russia right now, helping her father with some business.

She told me in confidence that some guy (35) has been texting her sexually, and trying to get with her. She told him she has a boyfriend, but the man replied, “that’s fine I just want sex.” He even had the audacity to say he likes her ass, and when he sees her he feels like he’s in love.

Now this especially pisses me off because I can’t do anything about it from a distance. I told her that if telling him to f*ck off didn’t do anything, she needs to tell her father. She said she’s just ignoring him, and embarrassed to tell her father because the guy has been working for him for decades, and the texts are lewd.

I told her that’s completely ridiculous, and now she’s upset she even told me. 

I want to either A) tell her father about it, get him to have the man f*ck off

Or B) demand she gives me his number and tell him off myself. 

Now I’m wondering if I would be the ass**** if I did either of those two things, potentially instigating or put her in more danger.

Edit*** I probably should mention, which is coming to mind now that people are saying he isn’t a stalker. He said he was going to come into her work & find her, to talk to her."	No A-holes here	0	0
c6uabv	2019-06-29 04:10:59	thepoormanguise	AITA for possibly stereotyping a Hispanic man just because his van creeped me out?	"I don’t believe I stereotype any type of person. Let me start off with that. I worked in retail, which taught me anyone is capable of being an asshole and anyone is capable of stealing. However, my opinion of myself is obviously bias, so my judgement may not be fair. Here’s the story:

I was driving behind a van today. They were going too slow, so I got over into the left lane. I caught movement out of the corner of my eye while I was sitting at a light. A Hispanic man was gesturing to me as he spoke to his friend. I got uncomfortable, but didn’t think much of it. I assumed he was complaining about people being impatient or something (I wasn’t tailgating). I was going to a shopping center and it was about 2-3 miles from that point. It wasn’t until I turned into the shopping center that I looked into my rear view. The van had been right behind me. 

I started getting a little nervous, but still didn’t try to assume anything. The van followed me to the parking lot of the store I had chosen to go to. I watched it circle around and then it parked directly next to me. I quickly drove from the spot and moved to a new one. The van then proceeded to park two parking areas (idk what to call them? It made sure to put itself within view of my car. I waited ten minutes, then I hid my car within a big mass of parked cars with another one in front of me. Walked around in stores for two hours to be safe. 

I told my friend about it later. He said I was stereotyping because I said he was Hispanic, but they had asked me what race he was! Am I the asshole and just projected a bunch of paranoia onto some random stranger because of race? If I was stereotyping, it was definitely subconscious. The van creeped me out and it was just odd that he chose that spot next to me since I had parked in the empty section of the lot. I tried to ignore the first incidents since I’m a guy and I guess I’m a little arrogant. Either way, it definitely humbled me a lot after that. I’m still in survival mode, so I can’t tell if I’m just a POS or it was definitely just a weird situation to be in.

Edit: I should add that I do often get anxious over situations that don’t require it, but I usually can just ignore it. Maybe it’s all because I was listening to a podcast covering abduction cases."	Not the A-hole	0	0
