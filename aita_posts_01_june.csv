bvti13	2019-06-02 03:58:50	thecrimsonflute	AITA for getting upset at my SO because he refused to Google my flights arrival details?	"I'm on vacation with my extended family that I haven't seen for the past 4 years. I was dropped off at the airport by my SO so I need someone to pick me up, and he offered.


Before my trip, I emailed him my flight information. During my trip I took a screenshot of my flight information and texted it to him a couple of days before I needed to fly back home. 


It's the night before I fly out around noon the next day, and he asks me when and where he needs to pick me up. I tell him my phone is dying, and we are still out. I tell him to look it up. (Remember I've emailed and texted him the flight information. He has the airline and flight number. And he knows the time which tells me he referenced the photo I previously sent him.) 


He tells me no, that's my job since he's the one doing me the favor. I tell him I'm out and about with a dying phone and he can either look it up or wait. (Texted him the old screenshot so he knows the airport and time, but that's not enough info apparently.)


I proceed to get upset, because I feel like I've given him plenty of info. Everytime I pick someone up. I follow the signs that match the flight info given to me. I honestly don't know what additional information I can give him at this point.


Unfortunately he calls me a dick/asshole and I call him childish for having to look shit up for him that's a quick Google. I tell him I'll just have someone else pick me up that knows the information better, but hes adamant about picking me up if only I give him the when and where.


I finally get to the place I'm staying, hook my phone up to charge and Google it. Unfortunately it's not the clearest answer due to the fact that it could change with a delay or change in flight. I give him my best guess and tell him that I'm not 100% positive since I normally just go to the airport and follow the prompts and use the flight number in case there's a dramatic change in termibal/gate. I text him a screenshot of the most recent info again.


In the end I'm still upset that I had to look this information up for him. The info I texted him included the airport, airline, flight number, time, gate I was arriving at, but was missing a clear and distinct terminal. But based on my memory from when he dropped me off it's pretty self explanatory once you're on the ground, but a tad harder when looking at the website. He did not accept my answer of follow the prompts at the airport. 


He's upset that I cant give him the information and calling him childish for not even trying to Google it while I'm with my family.


I will admit I was being a tad of a dick with how I was telling him to look it up once he started to push back on the matter. But am I the asshole for being upset that he couldn't even take the time to look up any additional information given the information I had already provided?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bvtfuv	2019-06-02 03:51:18		AITA for not wanting to get engaged to my boyfriend?	"We’ve been together for six months. Back in August I moved to a new city for college and now I want to move back to my hometown, be with my friends and family, and finish college there. My boyfriend that I met while being here has a lot of issues and he doesn’t think he can handle long distance but he eventually came around and decided to try it. Also the distance is only an hour and a half and it’s only for 5 months until he can move to my hometown once he’s done with the college classes he needs. To be honest he’s very insecure and ever since I told him I’m moving he’s been coming to me with all these what ifs and scenarios that he makes up in his head and gets himself worked up with. I tell him he has nothing to worry about, everything is fine, we will still see each other pretty often, and we’ll talk everyday but he doesn’t stop making himself sick with worry. I told him early on that I want don’t want to get engaged before one year of dating. That gives us time to get to know each other and make sure it’s what we really want. 

Today he told me he thinks he’s giving up a lot by trying long distance and I should let him propose to make me him feel better about us doing long distance thing. I don’t like this because 
1.) I’ve told him many times that I don’t want to be engaged before at least a year. 
2.) To me it sounds like he’s just proposing so that he can have a lock on me while I’m away and know that I’m not going anywhere since we’re engaged. I’m not his property to claim. 
3.) it’s very clear to everyone around us  that even at 6 months we have a very rocky relationship. There’s always a lot of fighting and just not knowing how to deal with each others issues. I’m still not sure if he’s what I want for the rest of my life. I need time and he’s not letting me have it. 

I told him no, we need to wait and he got visibly upset and told me that he doesn’t see why I won’t do it since he’s given up so much and is going to continue to give up so much. Am I wrong for saying we still need to wait?"		1	0

Several of my friends were there both in high school and college and one friend, I’ll call her Jane, brought a small cooler of alcohol (she’s not 21) and secretly made herself mixed drinks. It was a larger indoor/outdoor party so it was easy to do if you weren’t looking. I was fine with her drinking since it’s her life, I may not agree with her breaking the law but I digress. I later find out she gave a few drinks to a friend of ours who is still in high school, brought a friend, and was driving herself home. She only drank a little but her and I talk a lot and I know she’s been going through some extremely difficult family situations and has gotten drunk before as a way to handle her emotions. I’ve always tried to encourage her to seek healthy ways to deal with stress since addiction runs in her family (and mine). After the party I texted Jane in what I felt was a very polite manor saying how I didn’t hate her and I’m not here to come down on her but that I felt that serving her alcohol was a little over line since she too knew that she was beginning down the road of substance issues. I told her she may have been fine today but I don’t think we should provide with a environment like that and we need to give her a space to healthily grow and deal with issues. She then proceeded to say mostly insulting things about who I was and how school had made me a dick. I told her I was merely standing up for how I believe we need to act as the adults now since people look up to us. AITA?
TL;DR told friend she shouldn’t serve any amount of alcohol to minors, she got mad at me and said I’m an ass."		1	0

Last weekend, my mom busted my dad cheating and now they’re starting the motions to get a divorce. I explicitly asked for them to not talk to me about the divorce and not to drag me into it. They agreed and said I wouldn’t have to deal with it. 

Well, now they’re both trying to drag me into it. My dad is actively bashing my mom, saying that she was manipulative and lying about being civil towards her. He has also been spam texting me to try and get me to “take his side” (verbatim). My mom is trying to convince me to say things to him on her behalf and keeps trying to persuade me to be on her side by trash talking my dad, no matter how many times I ask her not to do this.

bvt9u0	2019-06-02 03:31:52	demonicillusion91	AITA for my position over a snoring issue with my roommates?	"  

So, apologies this might get a little long and I am trying to make sure I present this somewhat objectively even though it will be a little tough since I'm somewhat biased here but I will give it my best shot and hopefully this all makes sense. 

We moved to a new state for jobs about a year ago and we had acquaintances who lived here and we ended up living in the same building as them because they helped us find a cheap place. My partner moved first because he had his job lined up and I stayed behind for a few more months while I got a job lined up as well. The place was a wreck unfortunately and we had so many issues with the landlord regarding the furnace, ceilings leaking and various other things, so I was really looking forward to our lease ending so we could find a new place. My partner had gotten to the new place in December and the furnace wasn't working for like a month so during that time our acquaintances were kind enough to let him sleep with them while the landlord sorted it out. \*This is important only because it leads to something in the future\*

When the lease was finally about to end we began looking for new places to live and we ended up having a conversation with the 2 of them about maybe trading up and getting a nicer place together. We talked about it and decided to go ahead with that plan and found a great loft with tons of space and amenities. It seemed like it was going to be great but shortly after moving in 1 of them (they are a couple) says that he can never sleep because of my partners snoring. I knew my partner snored but it has not bothered me ever and honestly I kind of forgot he did until my roommate complained about it.

I have been up just browsing reddit while my partner has been sleeping and I didn't think the snoring was bad at all but we would still get a call regarding his snoring. My partner got mad at me that night for not having moved him before our roommate called but honestly it was barely audible to me and I was right next to him. 

My partner is too kind and just tries to do everything in his power to fix it by buying various devices to try and stop the snoring and lately he has taken to just staying up which I am very against since he is clearly exhausted now all the time. I get that it is frustrating to not be able to sleep but snoring is out of my partners control. And having to deal with the passive aggressive attitude is getting to me. 

We aren't in the greatest financial situation and our insurance isn't great but we have set up an appointment for a sleep study which will hopefully allow us to get a CPAP to hopefully fix this issue, but honestly it makes me frustrated that we have invested, by the time this all gets wrapped up, hundreds maybe around a thousand dollars to try and resolve this issue. I want to call out my roommate about it and tell him to grow up but I don’t think that is the best approach here. I don’t want my partner to keep feeling solely responsible and don’t know how to help."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvt9kf	2019-06-02 03:30:57	sloftchu	AITA for moving on so quickly after leaving my best friend since elementary school?	"To make things clear I didn’t really leave her I just didn’t know how else to phrase it. Basically we’ve been best friends since elementary school and now that we’re in high school things have changed a lot. We used to be basically the same person, but now we have a lot of disagreements and don’t seem like the right fit for each other. Which is really hard to say because of how close we used to be. 

Anyway, we recently had a big argument because of a misunderstanding, but we made up. The fight was over how we aren’t as close anymore but after we made up we accepted that we just aren’t as close anymore but will try to fix it if we even can. We’ve grown apart which is sad, but normal for high schoolers.

The thing is, we’ve very recently only been not close and I already have a new best friend which I love. But I feel bad not considering her my best friend anymore because it just happened so quickly.

Been lurking here for a while, figured I'd finally post this on a throwaway. Sorry if I ramble.

I (18f) started a restaurant job about three weeks ago. So far, other than having a bit much to keep up with, it's been really fun. The hours are working out nicely and the other staff are super patient and kind to me. I'm looking forward to staying here for a while.

There's a server there that I met on the first day, and he made it pretty obvious right away that he was interested in me--telling me I look great in my uniform, saying he'll ""never forget"" seeing me walk in for the interview, etc. On top of him being a little too old for my liking (I'd say his late twenties at the oldest, and even though I don't have a problem with age gaps in my own relationships and others, that's a little too much for my age right now), I don't really like dating people I've just met and I'm not eager to date anyone from work.

So, when he point-blank asked me if I had a boyfriend, I told him yes, which was a lie. I know that's immature of me, but I'm a shy person, especially with people I've just met. I avoid awkward situations like the plague and turning him down sounded too awkward to me, even though I know the mature thing to do was say no, but that I wasn't interested.

Anyway, since then, he hasn't really let up on the obvious flirting. If I'm not smiling, he asks me what's wrong. If I am smiling, he asks me what for. The way the kitchen is set up, my ""station"" is in front of the expediter window, and he can see me when he comes to the waiter station. When he sees me, he just stares at me and smiles, and I can tell he's doing it even when I'm not looking at him.

Yesterday, he asked me if I *still* had a boyfriend, and I reflexively said ""yes"" again. I don't know whether I should tell him the truth or not. On the one hand, I know I'm being very immature, and if he asks anything about my fake boyfriend, I'll be floundering to come up with more lies. On the other hand, if he's asked me ""Do you *still* have a boyfriend?"" after the first time, I don't know what he'll ask me if I say that I don't.

My sister and I are pretty close, less so now with her having a boyfriend though. I've hung out with them both a few times, but it's always pretty awkward for me. First off, I'm not really social to begin with. Secondly, I am very uncomfortable with PDA if it's in my close vicinity. Lastly, I am admittedly a self conscious person.

I've allowed them to stay at my place a few times, and that was fine. And I've taken them out to eat once or twice, but that was awkward. They'd basically just try to make me uncomfortable. 
One time while we were at Five Guys, her boyfriend ""joked"" about my sister being fat with how much food she got. This immediately made me very upset bc the amount of food I had was more than she had. I didn't say anything, but after that and him hanging all over her while we were eating... I just wanted to leave. After this interaction, I just decided to not go out to eat with them anymore.

Tomorrow I'm going out on the lake with my family and my mom invited him along. I don't want this because I'm going to be very uncomfortable the whole time. However, I feel I may be TA.

So I'm going to be having my birthday soon in a few days (June 10th) and my sister wants to have a friend over. I get it that if she never has friends over than that's fine but her friend always rubs me as spoilt. It seems like my sister always puts her on a pedestal and it irks me because I KNOW she isn't as great as she seems. My sister seems to think it's okay to invite people over on other sibling(s)'s birthday parties which I find VERY rude. Especially since I know her friend will trash the house and that my sister won't pick up so I'll end up cleaning when it's almost my birthday. I know I sound VERY entitled but my sister always has friends over. She complains about not having them over when she had one over on my brother's BIRTHDAY PARTY! That was two weeks ago and I just... my sister's friend isn't as great as my sister makes her to be, there will be a mess I'll have to clean up, my sister always has friends over, and IT'S MY BIRTHDAY! I feel as if she shouldn't act as if she owns everything... I dunno. Am I being selfish? I just want to have friends over and if she has her friends over all the time it feels like it won't be special to have my friends over. And my mom will be tired from my sister's friend...

At this point I knew I needed to pee right then really badly so I opened the door and went to the bathroom. Of course at this point she opens the shower curtain and screams that I’m there to peek at her. Her dad comes rushing in and accuses me of spying on his daughter.

2 months ago my wife and I found after being friends with “Mark” for 10+ years he was actually married to a man and identifies as bisexual. We were very shocked. We are the only people in his life who knows this besides his husband (been together 2 years, married for 1). 

Now my wife and I have a close-knit friend group. This consists of “Mark” his bother and a good friend “Megan”.  “Mark”’s brother has been out for year and is a proud gay man. Mark and his brother are close.

“Megan” has pretty much been in love with “Mark” since they’ve known each other from high school. And considers “Mark” her best friend. She has recently become suspicious bc he’s never girl interests and he’s been distant. 

Today we went out with “Megan” and she was very upset bc “Mark’ has been MIA. My wife and I know it’s bc his husband has been getting on him to spend more time with him. But she doesn’t know that - she just thinks he’s “over her” and a bad friend.

Are we the assholes for not telling her the truth and letting her sulk and cry? Our biggest concern is that if this comes out to our larger friend group “Megan” and “Mark”’s brother may become upset bc we knew and didn’t say anything. But at the same time we don’t feel like it’s our place to “out “ him."		1	0

We were shopping in the knick-knack district and he came across a ""practice"" butterfly knife. Basically a butterfly knife, but with out any edge  and a fairly flat edge (so not a cutting hazard for the record). 

I'm immediately a little uncomfortable with the idea, and after thinking about it a bit my father actually initiates the veto, but it sort of validates my unease and I back him up. My mother doesn't see the ""big deal.""

Another detail: I'm pretty sure these knives are illegal in his state as they are in this one as well, though I suppose these ""practice ones"" don't count.

So we leave and a meltdown ensues. Cutting a long story short, my mom continues to enable him to fight this decision and we end up on the phone with his parents where I explain that it makes me nervous because even if it isn't actually dangerous, someone else may not realize that and I am very uncomfortable with the idea of a cop pulling a gun on him. His parents initially side with me, but then change their minds when they hear that the blade can't cut at all. 

I try to give them the scenario of a teacher seeing it or a cop, either of which I'm pretty sure would be a mess. Kid's insisting that he will never use it out of the house. Yeah, right. I literally tell his parents, ""so you think an 11 year old isn't going to try to sneak this out of the house to show his friends?"" They just kind of laugh it off. 

At the end of the day, I tell his parents that I am not going to tell how to raise their kid, but that I was not going to let him buy it while under my supervision. The compromise I propose: these things are available cheap on Amazon.

Just told my older brother this morning that I might not be able to make it (I'm going shopping for one of my best friends' surprise birthdays) since I might get home late. He got pretty irritated, saying that I always have plans when my dad wants to meet, and he's implying that I barely make any effort to meet my dad. My parents' families aren't really in good terms, either.

It's just that I only ever get informed about my dad being in town when I already have plans made. Am I being too selfish? Am I dumb enough to actually make a decision for myself?"	No A-holes here	0	0
bvt4qs	2019-06-02 03:15:20	ExDe707	AITA for blocking a friend before we had the chance to confront someone we both dislike?	"To keep anonymity and comprehension at an acceptable level, person I blocked will be called ""Max"" and the person we both dislike will be called ""Chad"".

Backstory first. Me and Max, not long ago, first met and had a discussion about Chad and how they made us dislike him. We're all in the same friends group and a third person agreed to help us talk with Chad and resolve issues because we've been avoiding Chad so far, but haven't blocked him because they haven't done anything dire so far.

A few days later on VRChat, a game where you can import almost anything done in Unity as Avatars (with only some limitations), Max brought out an Avatar that was designed to make people's computers lag (a ""lagger"" so to speak, not as bad as a ""crasher"" that makes your game crash though) and briefly made me lag with it. I didn't notice it was them until I pulled up their avatar stats and noticed the like 12000 mesh particle active polys, amongst other things. In layman terms, that's a fuckton of particles for the GPU to render, so I hid their avatar to give my GPU some room to breathe.

I asked Max about it. They laughed confirming it. My response was to say he shouldn't be using it, upon which they asked me if I'm lagging. I'm not because I've hidden their avatar. They said it's a lagger, it's intended to lag people like that. Naturally I got suspicious and asked if he uses it on other people deliberately. He admitted to doing that to others and that's where I snapped and removed them from my friends list and walked away to sit down somewhere.

Max followed me to ask ""What the fuck is wrong with you? We were talking about Chad and then you're gonna do the same thing he did."" (I have no info on this) The rest of all the arguing was about how I don't support people negatively affecting somoene's experience, Max trying to find excuses like ""It looks cool"" and ""At least it doesn't crash people"", downplaying it to say they were just messing with me ""like play punching your shoulder"". I rejected the excuse that it was ""just a joke"" by saying it stops being a joke when it's at the expense of other's enjoyment.

A bystander asks Max why they don't just delete that avatar. Their explanation, quite simply, ""It's fun"" and that's where I snapped again. In cold, calm rage I went up to Max's hidden avatar's face and told them that was the last straw. Talking over them when they said ""I thought you were a cool guy"" I said they have the right to use whatever avatar they want and I have the right to do the right thing which is to block them and forget Max ever existed.

I realized I lost someone who would stand by my side and confront Chad together with me. We both have a common foe and this incident made me part our ways. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0
bvt4a5	2019-06-02 03:13:52	nagromargella	AITA for Not Wanting to Give This Guest a +1?	"I’m getting married a week from today, and all of a sudden a family friend is asking to bring a date.  I specifically asked him if he wanted to bring someone a month or two ago, and he said no.  Now he’s claiming he didn’t know until now that his girlfriend would be free, but also that they already have plans next weekend that she’s a part of.  Which is seriously setting off my BS meter, but I digress.

As you can see from my responses [here](https://imgur.com/a/UhNnV0W), I’m trying to say no without seeming like an ass, and he’s having none of it.

Side note: my fiancé and I decided long ago to not offer plus-ones to people who’ve been in a relationship for less than a year as of the wedding date, and this girlfriend can’t have been around for more than a few months.  I already told two friends that they couldn’t bring their boyfriends (one of whom we’ve actually met, unlike this woman) because of that rule, and it pisses me off that he even asked this late.

Edit: [me asking if he wanted to bring someone](https://imgur.com/a/swGU2S3).  He also needed to be reminded to RSVP on the deadline two weeks ago (after being reminded a week earlier), and didn’t mention anything then, either.  So he’s had *plenty* of chances to ask, which leads me to believe even more that she’s a brand-new girlfriend.

bvt478	2019-06-02 03:13:38		AITA for demanding that we get my car fixed before my husband buys a boat?	"So my son of the non veggie refried beans fame needed a vehicle.   My husband (his stepdad) has a truck,  over 10 years old,  good condition. 

I have a small 4 door (2013), but my son is too tall to drive it comfortably. 

So, my husband buys a super fancy, all the bells and whistles, off roading pick up truck so we can give older son his old truck. 

Everything is fine in this.   I'm a little jealous because holy cow this truck is amazing... but it's all good. (An $800 monthly payment, but we can afford it... other vehicles are paid off, but still wowza... that's a hefty price tag.)

Anyway,  he really, really wants a fishing boat.   

Which is totally fine.   We can afford it. 

But my car has a janky ass steering wheel and I don't want to get him a toy boat until my car is fixed.   

You probably can't tell by this post, but my husband is pretty cheap, generally.  We've got a good friend who will work on our vehicles for the cost of parts, but obviously he's busy... He wants to wait until our buddy is available to fix my car. 

But he still wants to start shopping for a new boat!!!!

So,  maybe it's a validation post, obviously he's the asshole, right?   He gets a fancy new truck, a fancy new boat,  and I have to wait for our shade tree mechanic friend to fix my car. 

Here's the deal... maybe I am the asshole because I think he should expedite getting my car fixed, he thinks if it's so important I should get it done.   So I said, fine, I'll take it into random shop to get it fixed. And he thinks I'll be wasting our money. 

Just downvote this post to oblivion... writing this out makes it all seem obvious.

I know that the answer is that we should be equals in our major purchases, etc...  and we are, but only in that I'm cool with whatever he spends money on (he brings in 2.5x what I do) and he's a tightwad about everything else."		1	0

"9 months after knowing each other, 3 months into dating.  She fools around with a married guy she works with during a business trip and it lasted a few months.

Later on she tells me what happened.  At the time she tells me, it was months after the trips and we were already talking marriage and children.

We get past it and move on.  We were just dating at the time, so it was not a big deal.

A year later, we are engaged and she brings up that work is sending her on the same trips with the same guy again.  We discuss it, I am uncomfortable, she declines the trips and says she understands why.

Now, three months after this, work asks her to go on these trips with the same guy.  My response is ""I am uncomfortable with this"" and do not make demands of not going, but in reality I will likely shut it all down if she goes.  I tried to explain there are boundaries in a relationship, and it is not about trust but more about respecting the other person.

She can easily say no, but demands there is trust and that now there is love between us then she should be trusted.

bvt2ix	2019-06-02 03:08:12	dontwannatalktoyou	AITA for not giving “closure” after 9 months of no contact?	"Hi Reddit, I had a toxic relationship with this guy for a year and I tried really hard to make it work, until I had had enough and decided it was better for both of us to call it quits. When I broke it off (didn’t come as a surprise), I said my goodbyes and ended with saying I’m going to block him on our main contact points going forward- not out of hate but to prevent contact so we would not end up reconciling. He was unhappy but said ok, then said you better block me on everything: snapchat, FB, Instagram, etc (none of which I use) and I said uh I’ll just block you on our main apps. We finished and I blocked him. He kinda had a selective memory when he gets stressed so a week later he left VMs from different/restricted numbers saying why have you blocked me wtf? I didn’t want to go through it all again so I ignored it.

Its been 9 months since, during which time hes called me obsessively intermittently. Sometimes theres no contact for few months, then suddenly 20 missed calls from restricted/different numbers accompanied with VMs from him. A period of silence, then a call from front desk of my apartment that someones there trying to see me and get to my door, with more restricted calls. Then I start getting one cent deposits into my venmo every day with messages that he’ll keep sending a daily cent until he runs out, reminders of remaining funds in his venmo, or weird poems. Then a snail mail letter, and on and on. After the time he physically showed up to my home, whenever his school had break, I refused to go out onto the street unnecessarily in fear that he’s waiting out there.

Lately his VMs are that hes been trying hard to contact me and can I please talk to him and need to unblock him and we need to end on a better note, and that hes going crazy because of this etc. That was essentially the VM he left an hour ago. Hes been on a streak these past 4 weeks. On one hand I KNOW im not an asshole for not picking up- right? I already said (once) im going to block him and a final goodbye… his selective memory isn’t my problem, so I don’t owe anything more right? But at the same time hes SO stressed for 9 months and he’s desperately pleading for… closure?

Maybe I can end it all (my misery and his misery) if I just picked up and say another goodbye. But, I do not want to pick up. I just don’t. I really really really don’t want to talk to him. The aversion to talking to him has now been piled unreasonably high to the point where I don’t care what the right thing to do is, I just don’t want to say a single word. I’m starting to feel like an utter asshole for not doing the mature (?) thing and simply pick up to reiterate my boundaries and simultaneously give him a re-closure, but… logically? I don't know anymore lol. AITA if I continue to refuse to pick up the phone and potentially end everyone's ""misery"" with a few words?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvt0lb	2019-06-02 03:02:05	throwaway087771	AITA for being worried about daughter cause of her boyfriend?	"Throwaway cause my children know my main account.

Recently my oldest daughter (19) came to me and told me she had a boyfriend. I was really excited since she never showed interest in boys and always stuck to school and stuff. So I asked if me and her father meet him, she said yes.

So 2 weeks ago she brought him over and he looked like a decent boy. He was Asian, sort of lanky and very nice. But I noticed how dark his hair was compared to his eyebrows as they were a nice brown but his hair was raven black. I didn’t think anything of it since my daughter dyes her hair a lot so she probably dyed his. Well I liked him, so did my husband. But a couple days ago I was hanging out with one of my friends and spotted him. He was dressed completely different from what I saw him in last time. He was dressed in gothic type clothes and wore a lot of makeup. I could tell it was him due to the unique beauty marks on his face.

I went home and called my daughter. I told her that I saw her boyfriend out and she got upset at me after I told her that men like him are bad news. My ex used to be like that and he was really horrible. My daughter told me it doesn’t matter how he dresses but his personality and morals matter. I agree but people who typically dress gothic aren’t the most bright (not intelligence but a good outlook on life). She told me that he treats her good and was really mad at me. She refuses to talk to me and I feel bad. My husband and sister told me I was acting like an asshole for telling her to breakup up with him and that I’m smothering her. But I feel like I was just trying to protect her and I meant no harm.

Am I the asshole here?

Update:
Thank you for your opinion/input. I was just really worried about my daughter due to the fact she’s exactly like me and I don’t want her to go down the same road as I did. I’ll apologize to her and her boyfriend when they’re back in town. I understand I was smothering and being overly judgmental. I just don’t want my daughter to experience the same things I did cause I love her."	Asshole	0	0

When this happened she confronted me and yelled “YOU HAVE [AMOUNT INVESTED] without telling me!” I then explained to her that since I was about 19 I have been making weekly contributions to investments. She then calmed down and asked me if I have anything else in my finances I didn’t tell her about and while I was reluctant to tell her she said I needed to trust her so I told her about the apartment I own. Now it finances itself and I got the down payment after I got lucky with some swing trading. After this she blew up.

bvsz67	2019-06-02 02:57:32	LeaveOnYourLight	WIBTA for opting out of a communal cable package? Part II, price hike. WTF.	" 

Fuming right now...

&#x200B;

So previously I had asked AITA for opting out of an excessive cable package in a room share situation for a house I moved into recently.  The results were mixed.  

&#x200B;

I do not own a TV. I haven't for over a decade and use streaming services, like most people on a budget.

&#x200B;

After moving in I was told my share of the cable bill would be $60, about $15 of which would go towards the part I actually use. The rest would be subsidizing the package one person decided on and pretty much uses exclusively. I have been in many such arrangements and my contribution would typically be $20-30/month. For the sake of civility, I obliged.

&#x200B;

I was not told prior to moving in how much it would be.  I assumed it would be comparable to the several other arrangements I had experienced.  I was wrong.  

&#x200B;

I am now being asked to contribute $70/month with no change in the package.  In fact, it has been negotiated to a lesser rate than previously.  I make $13/hour and have student loans. Sure, the rent isn't bad but this amounts to almost twice the cost of all other utilities COMBINED (water, gas, electric).  I just can't.  I'm about to lose my shit because getting my own internet would be $30-40/month. Again, I don't even own a TV and had no part in deciding on the package which I don't even use.

&#x200B;

Who the hell pays $200+/month for cable anyhow? There are 4 of us in the house and one person doesn't even contribute at all (I'm pretty sure he still uses the internet, like me. I'm not taking issue with him- he's nice, keeps to himself and doesn't speak English. I also believe he sends most of his money back home to his family.).  The other guy in my boat agrees that it's excessive and wants to change the package but doesn't want to rock the boat.  

&#x200B;

So WIBTA for putting my foot down and not only refusing the price-hike, but opting out entirely and getting my own internet? The other gets to opt out, so I don't see why I wouldn't be able to.  I'm all about staying amicable but we're talking about over $300/year for something I don't have any part of and last time I checked these kind of things should be a communal decision.

bvsxhr	2019-06-02 02:52:10		AITA for being upset that my best friend started hooking up with a guy I was previously with?	"For context, this was a year ago my senior year of high school. I had been friends with (we will call her Ava) since the eighth grade. Basically, I was essentially dating this boy for two months. (We never made it official.) We were hooking up, and went on a handful of dates. I told Ava that I was very into this boy. I ended up getting ghosted by him after an uncomfortable moment when fooling around. (I do not personally believe this is relevant to the story.) 

Anyway 3 months later, Ava started hanging out with him. She asked me if it was okay, and I specified that I would be okay with it IF THEY HUNG OUT AS FRIENDS. And she said that it was all they were. Fast forward about a month later and we were all at a party, and I was talking to Ava. My kind of ex came up to her and kissed her goodbye.  Honestly I felt my heart drop in my chest. There may have been a hint of jealousy, but I felt betrayed because she lied. Later that evening I asked her if they were together, and she said yes and that she was into him. I really really wanted to be happy for her. Note thy I’m not sure at what point they actually began hooking up, but this was not the last time I watched them hook up. 

Fast forward to the night of our graduation, where they spent the entire evening heavily making out in front of a large portion of our grade. Which would have been fine if it was anyone else, but it honestly just hurt my heart. I wanted to be happy for her, since she didn’t date a lot in high school, where as I had dated a handful more people that she had. 

This brings me to the question: am I the asshole for being upset that my best friend and kind of ex began hooking up? Or should I have just supported them because she is my best friend and I *eventually* knew she liked him."		1	0

bvswo8	2019-06-02 02:49:20		AITA For Wanting To Cut Off My BFF	"It all started to change when I drove 8 hours out of state to see him and my others for a week during NYE. I got annoyed when I drove for over 30 minutes to go hiking and he refused to continue after less than an hour.

The same night he, my other friend and I plan on going to a club for an an event, I drive us there and Josh refuses to get out of the car. Just wants to go home and chill, after 15 minutes of trying to convince him the other friend and I leave, he eventually gets out of the car and when we are about to walk inside he makes an offer. He wasn't able to go clubbing with us during NYE because his girlfriend said no, so he says if we skip the club he promises to go clubbing with us on NYE afterall.

I leave with my other friend for his place, we plan on seeing Aquaman, Josh drives out and we tell him the plans and he complains about driving out to pay for a movie he's already seen and tries to convince us to not to go, I tell him I'm not changing my plans again.
He changes his mind and says he was joking that he planned to see the movie with us. When it comes time for NYE he flakes without a text.

I rationalize it as I'm not flexible enough to change plans or that I'm being too sensitive.

I return home and he constantly throws me under the bus in front of strangers we game with about how I'm not having casual sex, I've explained to him how I've got my hands full with work and my family but it's just an excuse. I must be gay and in the closet somehow, I'm afraid of women, my reasoning is somehow an excuse to him. I'm his best friend but treats people he barely knows with more respect.

Any problem I have is irrelevant because I'm not getting ""enough pussy"". He shames me every chance he gets for not having as much sex as he does. (the same guy who says he gives oral for hours or that he always lasts multiple hours in bed)

 I'm 21 and living at home, my dad is extremely sick and doesn't have much time left, my older brother is disabled and aged out of the system so I wouldn't feel right leaving my mom alone to deal with all that. That doesn't matter to him, I live an extremely sheltered and privileged life and I've somehow never struggled or lived because I don't pay as many bills or work as many hours as he does, and it of course it comes back to girls. Girls will think I'm too old to still be living at home, he lecturs me in front of others saying I need to move out, give up on my dream career and get a 9-5 to pay rent on a place I'll never own.

Anytime I stand up for myself I'm butthurt or too defensive, I can never stand up for myself without being wrong.

He starts flaking, we had a habit on our days off to play Xbox together but he leaves for another group as soon as they ask him. Then he just starts ignoring me, only for me to see him in a party playing with them and making excuses later like that he fell asleep.

Now that we've been dating for a while she's gone from keeping her bodily functions to herself to openly burping and farting around me when we're at home, which she finds hilarious.

At first I would just make comments like ""that was a pretty gross one"" and stuff like that to try to get the point across that I don't like it but honestly she found that even more funny. Well a couple days ago I got sick of it and asked her to go in the other room if she was going to do that.

When she realized I wasn't joking it turned into this whole argument about how its no big deal and that's what couples do. 
 She wants to feel comfortable at home and I should feel happy about it because it means she feels comfortable around me. She also said I was being sexist and prudish expecting women to be perfect little princesses instead of real human beings.

I can kind of see her point, but at the same time I don't expect her to be perfect or never have one ""slip"" but I just think it's poor manners and disrespectful to do that around other people.

There was some 40ish year old guy with some lady that he was clearly with that had his head against the back of my seat pushing it back and forth. I moved my seat back a little bit to take a nap and he started pushing against my seat forcefully with his hand. I looked back and him and his lady friend gave me a devil stare. I just kept my seat in the position and he stopped a couple minutes later. 

FFW the flight attendants started bringing the drink and snack cart through and his lady friend or whatever signaled to the flight attendant. I saw it out the corner of my eye and I turned off my music playing through my headphones to hear what she was saying to the FA. The lady explained that I was constantly moving my seat back and forth and bothering them. I actually chuckled a bit and the FA noticed and told the lady that she couldn’t do anything unless any of the FAs saw anything. They told me off when we got off the flight then marched away

AITA since I didn’t move my seat back, if they would have simply asked nicely I would’ve moved my seat back, no big deal, but since he pushed my seat and everything I decided to be stubborn. Should I have moved it back?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
bvspvw	2019-06-02 02:27:52		AITA for sleeping with a 19 year old?	"I live in Canada where the legal drinking age is 19 before anyone brings that up. 

I recently got divorced. I’m 29 and was with my wife for six years. We’ve been separated for two weeks. 

Yesterday some of my buddies took me out for drinks as I’ve been really in the dumps obviously. 

We went out to a bar and I got pretty drunk. At one point a super attractive girl sits down with friends a little bit away from us. I’m immediately attracted to her but I can tell she’s young. 

At one point she walks up to the bar and I get a sudden burst of courage and walk over to her and ask her how’s she doing. I can tell she’s into me and after a bit I ask her if she wants to go “somewhere more private.” There’s a single stall bathroom in this bar so we go there and do our thing. 

When we come out, we each go our separate ways. I meet up with my friends and I tell them what just happened. I thought they would be happy or laugh about it but when I told them who it was with they told me that it was “creepy” and that she was basically a kid. I got upset and said that she wanted it too but they kept saying that it was weird and that they would never try to get with someone that young. I tried to enjoy the rest of the night after that but it felt awkward.

bvsoqn	2019-06-02 02:24:16	thin-af-mint	AITA for wanting my roommate to move out when their lease is up, even though they haven’t found a new place yet?	"TL;DR at the bottom.

Our lease is up as of today. They have not packed up any of their things, or even made an effort to go and get boxes to begin packing. They started searching for places last month and should have started earlier, given they knew when the lease was up. 

They work the same amount of hours as me a week, and doesn’t do as much with their free time as they could. They could have used their computer time to go and apartment hunt or pack their things. 

I am kinda fed up with them at this point. I’ve lived with them for a year now and feel like a maid. I end up doing all of their dishes, cleaning their food out of the fridge, and cleaning the apartment in general. When time came to resign the lease they told me and my boyfriend they’re planning on moving out. 

Yet here we are, end of the lease and they’re  still here. No signs of even trying to move out. New roomie is supposed to be moving their things in this month. Every time I try and ask them something they act like I’m the ass. For instance, I asked if they could help me figure out switching the electric bill into my name (currently it’s under their’s), they told me to get my dick figured out.

I have a day off this week (rare since I usually don’t work weekends only weekdays)  to get the apartment clean for the new roomie and I can’t if they are still living here. That and I need to get the landlords to fix some things in the apartment and I can’t due to them still being here.  

TL;DR: Roommate won’t move out at the end of their lease, new roomie is supposed to move in. Old roomie does not have a new place to move to, but I need them gone to get things ready and fixed.

Am I the asshole in this situation? Am I overreacting or is my reaction justified? I feel stuck in this situation since old roomie is related to my boyfriend. And my boyfriend is gone for a month."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bvsomp	2019-06-02 02:23:55	yung_gran	AITA for telling my brother to get his shit together after my dad had a massive heart attack	"My brother is an American otaku. He literally does nothing except play games and watch anime. He’s 22 and never had a job or gone to college (despite having 4 years pre-paid by our grandparents). He sits in my dad’s dark house all day and night.

I’m 29 and have struggled with anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. I still do. However, I forced myself to accomplish things because I simply felt I had to. 

From my experience, more and more kids my brothers age make excuses to do nothing and live off their parents. Granted, we both had abusive childhoods, so I do understand the mental strain of it. However, I did not grow up with these victim praising narratives of decision fatigue and executive order syndrome and all those other excuses to avoid doing shit we don’t wanna do.

Back to the story- my dad has had cancer twice before this. My brother was barely helpful the first time when he had to have an organ removed. The second time, with chemo, he was a lot more supportive. I was living overseas at this time and I’m glad he was there for him. 

I’m still overseas, and my dad just called to tell me he had a massive heart attack. My brother was there for him and he’s fine now. However, he added that he think the cancer is back and his PET scan is next month. 

I was internally freaking out and sent my brother a text about getting his shit together. It went like this:

“This is def the time to get serious about school so you can get on your feet. I won’t be able to support you from Japan if he dies. I don’t mean to sound harsh or intimidating, but this is the moment to force yourself to make a change. 

One of the ways you can do that is by asking me for help. I’ve been a resource here the whole time. I try to reach out to you, but you deny the help. You need to take help where you can get it to succeed. I know it’s hard, but I know you can do it.”

Of course, he didn’t respond. He never does. But I know he’s probably pissed bc he’s always pissed when I push him. I just hate that not only do I have to worry about my dad dying, but I have to worry how my adult white male brother will provide for himself if he does. We don’t have any family nearby whatsoever, and the family we do have is pretty distant and may not be able to help him.

So, AITA for how I speak to him?

EDIT: I should also add my brother living off my dad is a pretty big financial strain for him. He’s an ex-con and his salary is not huge. He’s worked hard to have a stable income."	Asshole	0	0

bvsmlf	2019-06-02 02:17:26		AITA for being upset at my boyfriend's boss for kicking me out of the store?	"So for some context, my boyfriend works in our local general store which is fairly casual and not really that professional. A prime example of this is how the Boss's daughter who also works there will constantly bring her toddler and baby to work  and having them run around behind the counter(where the tobacco products and cash register are). The boss herself will have her local friends come and hangout in the cafe part of the store for hours at time and hangout with them whenever she isn't busy. I occasionally go to work with my boyfriend and used to just quietly sit behind the counter in a chair hidden out of sight from the customers(which she said was fine). I wouldn't distract him much at all and even help with cleaning and stocking the goods. The boss was 100% fine with it in the beginning until a customer complained that I wasn't doing my job by seeing to them at the counter, even though I don't work there. She said it wasn't a big deal just that I couldn't go there everyday, even though I already didn't. I started going once a week, if that, and stayed out from behind the counter at all costs. I chose a booth that was being used for flower storage to sit and quietly read. 

 Yesterday we had ordered a split pizza because I can't eat onions and peppers while my boyfriend enjoys them. They didn't bother reading our ticket all the way and just made one pizza, which I couldn't eat a bite of due to the toppings I mentioned. They also added jalapenos which are optional only and you don't add them unless specified. So today she comes to my boyfriend and tells him that the cook was pissed off by a ticket he had written. My boyfriend had drawn a pizza cut in half and labeled the sides with the corresponding toppings. The cook was apparently 'horribly offended' by this and complained to boss. When I spoke up in defense of the ticket and tried to explain we only did it so it was done right this time she snapped at me and said ""Well you're not supposed to be here anyway,"" and didn't allow anymore arguements about the ticket. I didn't say anything but I really feel the need to confront her. I don't think it's right of her to turn me away while her grandkids are allowed to run around screaming and ripping merchandise off the shelves, not to mention she made a big deal about no one under the age of 19 being allowed behind the counters, which is where the kids regularly hangout. I've had to stop the toddler from taking cigarettes out of their shelving because no one else was watching her. 

I don't see why me reading a book in the corner of the store makes any difference to her. I wouldn't have an issue if she had said no from the beginning but to told it's okay and have it suddenly not be okay really messes with all the social anxiety issues I have. Should I confront and ask why she's treating me so unfairly? I really don't understand the sudden change of heart and why the same rules don't apply to everyone else."		1	0
bvsly8	2019-06-02 02:15:25	that1guyscuba	AITA For throwing a Party for my kid	"So a little backstory, I moved halfway across the country for a job 2 years ago. My wife and I decided after months to do this because it was in the field I wanted, she supported the move, and 2 years later we are far better off than we ever were before. We also have a daughter, 14 years old now.

1 year in, my sister-in-law was struggling back home to make ends meet. She was addicted to opioids, and has 3 kids with none of their fathers in the picture. We offered to take her in, moved her across the country (she lived where we did), and set her and 2/3 kids up with us (the 3rd stayed behind with a mutual agreement with the dad). 

So flash forward to today, and she has a job she's been at for 3 months where she's doing really good. She delivers pizza for a chain using my wife's car and we ask her for 1/3 of the bills and about $200 over to to pay back some loans we took out to help pay while she was unemployed.  But recently she's been running short. It's a tip-based job, so income fluctuates and we understand. My daughter has been taking all of this with grace. 

She does really well in school and helps with the kids all the time. She doesn't ask for much and gets good grades (we have a policy, you bring home As,B's, or C's, and we don't hover. Self sufficiency). We don't want to strip her of her adolescence because that never works well and she deserves one. 

She has 3 annual requests, one of which is to throw a pool party after school lets out for the summer, invite friends, eat snacks and have fun with friends. In total, maybe $60 in pizza, snacks and soda for 7 teens. 

However, my sister-in-law came up short again and I told her her stuff would suffer if that's the case. She flipped her crap and after a debate where I laid out the bills, she gave me $100 more out of her paycheck. But then Immediately started complaining about the fact we're throwing the pool party because ""money is tight"", which it is, but you sacrifice for your kids. We just had it today and are planning to discuss the whole situation after she gets off work.

Today I am working with my coworker who constantly roasts me and other coworkers for fun. He has a mindset of always being the leader and always being in charge and never listens to anybody. I wont say that hes an asshole or anything, ive known and been friends with him for a while. you just cant tell him anything because he is under the assumption that he knows more than anybody else in that part of the kitchen.

I ask this coworker: Which one is ours? he says: Clearly its this one over here.  

now, I havent slept in 2 days, the way he said it was so snide and condescending. I was just trying to make sure he doesnt run out of chicken. The fact he said that made me upset and I snapped at him and said ""Then make that fucking sandwich then! why do you have to talk to me like im fucking stupid? its a simple question. whats your problem?"" he replied: ""it wasnt a simple question it was stupid!""

But then, most every day after work, she wants us to have mixed drinks, a manhattan, or an old fashioned, both about 250 calories. Then she wants to have ice cream, or another sweet snack.   


Long story short, tonight I said to her ""Why do you always say that you need to lose weight, and then drink high calorie drinks, and eat ice cream/cookies at night, don't you want to lose weight? Because you either need to pick weight loss or those foods, you can't have both."" And that set her off, crying about how she is fat, and asking why I care so much about her caloric intake."

bvshzd	2019-06-02 02:03:12	artorianscribe	AITA For Bringing My Cat On a Plane Knowing What Might Happen?	"So, I moved across the country today. Literally, from the west coast to the east coast. I’ve had this cat for almost three years. She was a rescue my ex and I adopted. She really grew attached to me, so when we separated a year later, there was no question who she’d live with.

The next two years that bond continued to grow and I knew when it came time to move that I could not abandon her. I had to get her across the country and she HATES kennels. 

I took her to the vet to get her some anti-anxiety pills, I got her a vest meant to calm her down, a face mask meant to shield her eyes and brought her favorite toy too. I did trial runs in the car and tried testing out the meds weeks out. She seemed somewhat calm, but it was a very thin line.

I took a red-eye for the longest portion of the trip (no direct flights existed) hoping other passengers would sleep through any mewing coming from her corner. 

All the way through the process, though, from shuttle to TSA to sitting down a lot of people glared at me. They all had something to say under their breath. Don’t get me wrong, some people were excited to see a kitty, but they were outnumbered. 

I was hopeful. She was quiet when we got on the plane. Then, take off happened and she went crazy. I mean, SCREAMING. I snatched her kennel out from under the seat and stuck my hand in to try to sooth her and she thrashed, bit me and cried. I cried too. It was terrible.

The person next to me reassured me that it was no worse than a baby and talked me down from having panic attack, but the people ahead of me weren’t as nice about it. I could tell they all thought I was the asshole for purchasing a ticket for my pet. 

After a while, she calmed down and my next door neighbor and I held a convo for a couple of hours until we both drifted off. So, I guess my question is, Am I The Asshole for bringing her knowing she might have a bad reaction?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I was too far so I couldn’t hit him and he ran to friend 1 and i told him i needed my joy-con back. So 2 tells me that he’s a GREAT thrower and decides to throw the Joy-con.

Originally our therapist ""Y"" was his therapist, and about 2 years ago he pushed for me to start seeing Y too. Shortly after I started seeing Y, my dad and his long term girlfriend broke up. I was absolutely devastated, leaving a stepmother and a stepsister I was not able to maintain contact with. We had been a family for 10+ years. Less than four months after he left my stepmother, he started dating a woman, who I will call ""S"". I did not know until they were a few months into it, and instantly I told him I thought it was way too soon. I have maintained this throughout their relationship. It has now been close to two years of him dating S. They are not living together, and are not actively planning a future together, as he does not want to have close parental relationships with S's 11 year old twins.

I am so hurt and frustrated that my dad brought S to see Y, and that Y is willing to meet with S.

bvsd1l	2019-06-02 01:47:59	Amitathrowaway2019	AITA in this argument with my GF about Health Insurance?	"Hey guys 

I currently live with my gf of 2.5 yrs in her parents house tht they are letting us stay in for fre. Her parents allowed us to move in so she can save money, and for me, so I can get own business off the ground. Unfortunately, recently due to a production issue in my product, my company has been effectively shut down for the month of may, and probably a good part of June as well.

Here's were the problems starts.

Due to me running my own company, and barely breaking even after bills at the end of the month, I've havent been able to aford healthcare for the past 2-3 yrs. With that, I've been developing some health concerns. Roughly year ago I had to go the the ER, and somehow was seen for free... however I don't expect that to be the case the next time i go. Recently i heard that insurance companies offer ""couples"" ins, as long as you live together, which we have for the past year. I asked her to check with her job if that would be a possibility to get me insured. 

As soon as my gf found out she said in her own words ""wow. had I known this I would have had your signed up a long time ago"" I asked her if we can get this set up and she said sure. She just needs to talk to her HR get the paperwork etc. for the next couple weeks I ask/remind her every other day. During that time she said she was either to busy to go the HR, or HR wasn't in the office... 

Going back to my own business and being shut down for the month. Before this hapened, I had a bit of money in my account ($1500+), that I decided to gift her (hindsight, worst decision ever) for car parts she wanted for her car(that I installed saving her $1200+). I didnt know my business was about to shut down for a month, and had jobs scheduled all thru may that would have made up for it, but... I had to cancel 2 days after the money was spent. To further make things worse, we had a 10 day vacation planned. We talked about it and seemed to be in agreement that while times are little rough right now, due to no rent, it's really not that big of a deal, and we would figure out the finances when were back from the trip.

On the Friday when we were leaving for the trip I asked her again to check with HR. She said she didnt have time, and well get it handled when we get back from our trip. Ok

We get back Sunday, Monday is a holiday, she goes to work Tuesday, I ask her again about the paperwork, and she said she didn't have time. Ok

Friday rolls around. I ask again... this time she says ""well... I've done some thinking, after the trip you owe me $2,000. I'm not going to sign you up for healthcare until you pay me back my $2k."" Wtf? 

I told her I find that to bit unfair and she's going back on her word. She insists that she wants her money back in full before she insures me.

I asked her, if she had signed me up months ago as she claimed, would she now cancel my ins just because my company is on hold? And she said no, she would've covered me, even up to 4 months... (ins is 100mo btw)

She got really sad when she heard this and Started crying and we got into a big argument which really made me sad too. I told her that Although I know I have an addiction problem I feel like I can control weed and since it’s something I genuinely love doing I feel like it’s okay to smoke once every couple months to take the edge of things and enjoy the high. I feel bad because I truly love her and want to make her the happiest woman she can be no matter what but I also don’t want to quit doing something I genuinely love as long as it’s in moderation and not frequently.

For example, he’s now going to church (growing up I’ve always known him as atheist) and has stopped drinking, cursing, etc. previous to this he’s been single and extremely negative and hard to be around for me.

I’m so happy for him and love that he’s been improving himself and she’s been assisting with that. 

What feels weird to me is I haven’t met Tammy, I live across the country and haven’t been home in a couple years. Tammy added me on Facebook and she’s VERY active on there. Constantly posting bible quotes, loads of selfies (almost daily), and photos with friends. She’s very beautiful and seems kind. 

My father doesn’t have any social media at all.

Am I the asshole for mentioning to my Dad when I look at her social it looks as if he doesn’t exist in her life? I briefly mentioned it and said “wow I’d love to see what you two look like together since there isn’t any photos on Tammy’s Facebook.” He seemed a little saddened and we haven’t talked since. He really wants my support and wants me at their wedding in September.

I don’t want my Dad hurt. He’s madly in love with this women. I feel like if I was engaged to a man I would at least post one photo of us together."	Asshole	1	0

Recently, I learned some information about one of her very good friends (well call him G). G apparently hooked up with a girl who was in a relationship with our other, mutual friend (well call him H). H was obviously distraught. Took him forever to get over the whole situation (rightfully so) and is now in a better place.

Despite all this information, my partner has stayed good friends with G. I told her that once I heard this, I was not fond of G and was uncomfortable with their friendship. If he deliberately hooked up with someone who he knew was taken, I have no respect for him and do not trust his intentions ever. I told her I would never even think about trying to tell her who she can and cannot hang out with, but I was not comfortable with it. She seems to think it’s not a big deal and consistently says how amazing of a person G is, despite seeing H completely heartbroken. 

I trust my partner more than anything, and do not think she would even think about doing that to me, but AITA for telling her that I am not comfortable with her seeing him?"		1	0

A few months ago me and one of my friends started texting back and forth a lot and became much better friends.

Me and her had known each other for a long time previously and I never thought I stood a chance of asking her out, so I didn't for years. Just a few nights ago I finally convinced myself to ask because I thought that in the worst case we would likely still remain friends.

The thing is that she actually said yes to going on a date surprisingly. After this I told my other friend as I felt it would be best for me to be the one to tell him and I wanted to make sure it wouldn't be *too* weird.

After we got to talking he seemed to get upset with me for not asking him if it was okay before I asked her out. In the past he had brought up that if I wanted to pursue her it wouldn't be an issue, but he told me the other night that he was joking when he said that.

At this point I'm lost and want to know if I was an asshole here. I still plan on trying to reconcile with him if possible as he hasn't responded to me in the past two days, but I didn't think he'd be bothered by it.

Edit: Thanks for your responses. I understand that I may have acted without thinking about the consequences, so now all that seems left is to try and talk to my friend and see if we can continue as friends in some sense at least."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Nah most likely. They go to the church often and befriended all the pastors and attend prayer meetings and other religious stuff.

Every Sunday they bring me along. I'm 18 and at first it was okay. Then I started going to church all by myself for sometime but then I realized I didnt really like it. I still believe in Jesus but I just didnt feel like going to Church. Instead, I would go to a nearby gaming cafe and waste my hours away until church service was up and lie about attending church.

Its really bugging me now that they are forcing me all the time and whenever I have problems, they tell me its my fault because I dont have christ in me anymore.

All this forcing going to church stuff is making me hate my religion even more and I want to pray on when I feel like it and not being forced.

TL;DR : My family forces me to go to church and I lie about going because I dont want to.

Edit: Okay so I failed to mention that yes I told them I didnt want to go to church anymore. But they kept insisting and get mad when I dont go to church so I just lie and skip church."	Not the A-hole	0	0

i asked why, and he said he owed his friend. so i asked his friend and he said that he wanted my boyfriend to sit with me.

i asked my boyfriend again and he said no and walked away.

i guess the reason i got upset was because my boyfriend has been extremely distant lately. he barely spends time with me anymore and used to have want to do everything with me.

bvrypl	2019-06-02 01:04:41		AITA for wanting my spouse to call?	"I found out mid-week that my grandmother was going into hospice care with weeks to live. She was old, but it was still sudden. I thought she had a few more years. I don't live close to her and her health has been in decline over the last decade, but we were close. I am not that close with the rest of my family and news about my grandmother's care and condition came in sparingly. I was (am?) feeling sad, helpless, and alone.

&#x200B;

On Wednesday, my spouse heard about her condition because my family connected with him first, and then he told me. He was at work, but told me he was available. I called him and cried over my lunch break. He was listening and supportive. I then got sent home from work because I was a mess. My family talked me out of going to see her because she was not awake. That night the doctors gave my grandmother only 24-48 hours. The next day was just me, intermittent crying, and checking my phone.

&#x200B;

Friday morning I did not hear from my family or my spouse. About lunchtime, I learned that she now was in and out of consciousness. I thought that I should go see her because even if she would not be conscious when i get there, I could maybe hold her hand while still warm. It is a 12-ish hour drive. I told my spouse that I may want to leave after work, but he was too busy to discuss, so I told him that we could talk when he got home. I didn't hear from him again until I messaged him at 5 asking him if he was coming home. He said he was on his way. He stayed at work late and did not let me know.

&#x200B;

When he got home, he was ready to go, but I was angry that he didn't tell me he'd be late. He was dismissive because it was 30 minutes. It made me madder that he minimized it. I added that I was hurt that he didn't check in that morning to see how I was. He said he had a busy day, and I asked him if he talked to any other friends, and he had. I was hurt he checked on someone else and not me. I asked to see the messages, then he deleted them. When I asked him why, he told me that he had been complaining about my high emotional needs. My spouse and I then fought all night and still are. Like googling ""divorce papers"" and printing them fighting.

&#x200B;

I didn't go see my grandmother. She died this morning.

&#x200B;

AITA for expecting him to check in or letting me know he would be late in this context?

&#x200B;

If I am, help me understand the support to expect from a spouse during grieving. Thanks. Hug those you love today because they may be gone too soon.

&#x200B;

Notes: 1) We are pretty communicative, but don't always check in about lateness or generally. On any given day it would not be a thing to come home late, unless we had made some plan or something. 2) We don't typically read each others texts, but we aren't really secretive either. Or at least I didn't think so. 3) I don't blame him for not seeing my grandmother before she died. I condensed stuff here, but I could have gone, and he would have gone with me if i needed him to."		1	0
bvrwxh	2019-06-02 00:59:30	HushLittleBoy	AITA because I didn't kiss my friend's sister?	" 

This is a quite long story, but ill try and keep it short. I learned about this subreddit by watching [r/Slash](https://www.reddit.com/r/Slash/) on youtube, and thought this story would fit in perfectly.

So literally 20 minutes ago I was at a party for one of my friends birthdays. He became 18, and both I and this girl is 18 as well.

When the school first started, back in August, I kissed this girl, let's call her Kissing Girl, KG for short. Then in January this year, I swapped classes, so that I could study stuff I liked more, and be with more of my friends. In this new class is the twin brother of KG, I will call him TB for Twin Brother. But as I said I kissed her at the first party, and didn't think much of it. But now I am quite good friends with TB., so I won't kiss her again, out of respect for my friend.

Now at this party I just was at, KG was flirting with me HARD, but I didn't realize it, because I always flirt with most of my friends, so I didn't think more of it then I usually would. Now later on at the party, she starts trying to kiss me, and I will spare you the details of how I kept avoiding dancing close with her for 2 hours, but will tell in the comments if people want. When I wasn't able to avoid her anymore, she tried kissing me, but of course, I rejected it, cause I didn't want to jeopardize my friendship with TB, and she got very angry at me, saying that it isn't fair that I don't want to kiss her just because I'm friends with her brother.

But now I am confused, am I the asshole for not kissing her, or was it the right thing to do?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bvrvup	2019-06-02 00:56:16	witnessinghistory	AITA for not want my fiancé to “babysit” for my soon to be in-laws?	"So my fiancé Andrew (m29) and I (f 29) recently got engaged a live about an hour away from his family. Maybe 2-3 times throughout the year his Aunt and uncle ask him the watch his nephew who is 16 years old! 

It’s always on a weekend when they are going out of town for the so I get that they want some overnight supervision for the teen, but I feel like it’s super inconvenient that they ask him to do this for them because he has a stressful full time job, has limited time off, and watching the nephew takes up the better part of sat-sun. They always include me in the invite to come babysit but I usually work Saturdays and can’t. He says they pay him but I think the money they leave is basically implied money to order pizza with and he doesn’t really need the extra money anyways.

So I feel like him becoming a fiancé and future husband should relieve him from his role as family babysitter. I’m annoyed for one that he agrees to do it and two that his aunt and uncle even ask this of him.  I’ve brought it up with him and he kind of shrugs it off and says he’s just family oriented (even though he hardly spend time with his nephew when babysitting because nephew is typical 16 year old and hangs out with friends or plays video games) and says I’m being controlling for not wanting him to spend time with his family. I want to spend time with his family too. I just don’t see how I’m being controlling and I think it’d be appropriate to ask him to baby sit if he was like a college student and needed the money but not as someone with a stressful job and fiancé.

I started going with my friend. The problem is... he's a dick. I still consider him a friend, but when it comes to fitness, he is super condescending. He would often mock me while we were working out. When we would be around others, he would talk shit about me to my face. I understand teasing, but this was just straight up insults for no reason. 

Instead of just telling him though, I just kinda stopped showing up. If he asked I just said I overslept. He eventually thought that I just stopped working out, when actually I just went in before he did and left. When I told him, he was genuinely upset. He was so salty that he started acting out on social media. I didnt think he felt so strongly about it.  This might all sound stupid, but we are really good friends.

bvrunw	2019-06-02 00:52:32	MentosCubing	AITA for trying to scan a QR shirt?	"TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm walking in the park and I see this lady wearing a white shirt with a huge QR code on the back. It drew so much attention to itself that you seriously couldn't miss it. Clearly the shirt was designed to stand out and make you want to scan it. Me being the curious little idiot that I am, I take the bait and try scanning it.

This lady notices me and says ""Um, excuse me, are you trying to take pictures of my kids?"" I didn't notice it at the time, but yeah, she was walking with two little girls by her side. (Keep in mind I'm a minor, and I think that's quite apparent based on my appearance.) 

I say ""no, sorry, there's a QR code on the back of your shirt that got me curious."" I assume she just forgot she was wearing something that begs to be photographed, and she's genuinely looking out for her kids. She goes ""Uh, a QR code? What's that?"" I don't want any trouble, so I say ""Oh, it's a black and white code that you scan and it takes you to a website."" She goes ""Don't take picture of my kids bro, that's not okay."" I apologise and walk off because she's probably going to take this further if I don't.

Then her husband (at least, I assume it was her husband) stops me and goes ""Hey, were you tryna take pictures of my kids?"" (He is obviously aware of what his wife is wearing; he's standing about 30m away behind her.) I say ""No, sorry, there's a QR code on the back of her shirt that I wanted to scan."" Granted, that sounds quite strange out of context, but he *did* have the context and he just didn't care what I had to say. He asks to see the photos I got of his kids (I didn't get any photos) and I assume that's going to be enough to calm him down, but he just keeps going. ""You really shouldn't be taking pictures of kids in the park, that's not smart. Unless you want the cops after you? Is that what you want?""

I'm getting quite annoyed at this guy, and if he's threatening to call the police I figure I might as well point out to him that I do have a leg to stand on. ""You do know what a QR code is, right?"" He's not listening to me at all and he says three or four times in the middle of my sentences ""Do you understand what I'm saying? Don't be taking pictures of kids."" Again, let me point out I have no photos of his kids. Or even of his wife. She stopped me really fast, which might have been just good cautious parenting, but I think she was just trying to pick a fight.

-

TL;DR: Woman is wearing a giant QR code on her back. I try to take a photo of it. It turns out she has kids with her I didn't notice, and she and her husband freak out at me (a minor) for trying to ""take photos of [their] kids,"" even after I explain that I'm just trying to see what the QR code is. Now I'm trying to determine whether that was a bad move on my part or if they were just trying to pick a fight."	No A-holes here	0	0
bvrufq	2019-06-02 00:51:56		AITA for ghosting my friend?	"My (22F) friend (24M) and I met online about 5 years ago, and initially we were really close. We would talk every day and we both had really bad depression so we confided in each other consistently. At one point I intentionally took too many sleeping pills and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. This provided the motivation I needed to get better.

While I was attempting to better myself, he claimed that he was hopeless and adamantly resisted trying. He would still confide in me, and I did my best to support him, but over time I felt drained from the nature of our conversations. I attempted to verbalize this, but it consistently turned into him attacking himself. He said that I was the only reason he was alive and made me promise that I wouldn't stop talking to him. 

I became worn down, and as I made friends who were generally positive I became more and more resistant to talk to him. It put me in a really bad place and took a lot of time. He would become really offended if we didn't talk nearly daily. He has provided ALOT of support for me, and I felt guilty that I wasn't able to keep providing that support when he seemed to need it. I also felt like I needed to prioritize my mental health first and foremost, and could not be his sole provider.

Eventually we had a nasty fight where he accused me of being a terrible, selfish friend (I knew this wasn't true) so I stopped talking to him. One thing to note is that he has a history of friends leaving really nasty endings, and I'm kind of a dick for promising that I wouldn't be one of them when times were good. At this point we were about three years into speaking.

About six months ago, I reached out to him because I felt guilty about how things ended and wanted to check in. We immediately clicked, and initially it seemed like he was making an effort to feel better.

However, in the middle of conversations he would start criticising me for not remembering certain details about his life and become short with me. He would share distressing information and resisted my pushes towards therapy. He would talk about how lonely he was, and when I attempted to empathize he would belittle my comments as common sense. When confronting him about hurtful behavior, he would pretend to not know what I was talking about.

I stopped talking to him again because it felt toxic, but I feel like an asshole for reaching out and re-opening that wound. I don't think I'm an asshole for prioritizing my mental health, but I think I might be for rekindling things."	Not the A-hole	1	0
bvrtkp	2019-06-02 00:49:20		AITA for telling my daughter to start saving up for a new car	"Throwaway since my daughter apparently reads this sub a lot

Background: My daughter bought my wife's old car from us when she was 18 (now 21) for around 3000. I told her I'd do my best (as an experienced mechanic) to keep the car running until after she graduates college in a year and a half. 

Today she returns from picking up food for my wife and I, and tells me that the car is making a few noises. I've been outside working on my wife's car in the heat all day and was irritated in hearing I'd have to work on my daughter's car again considering I just finished fixing her car's AC. Granted the car was not making these noises before I fixed the AC, but it seems as if the car is having one problem after another. 

After she describes the noises to me, I tell her ""Well it looks like you're just going to have to start saving up for a new car. Maybe the car wouldn't have so many issues if you didn't drive the car like you're on a race track."" My daughter gets visibly upset and says, ""I haven't driven my car like that in years, and it just started acting up yesterday."" Now, I did ride with my daughter the other day and she's a good driver. She used to be a speed demon on the roads and take turns too fast, so I suppose I still think of her that way.

Anyway, my daughter clams up after a little more conversation and goes to her bedroom. I can hear her crying. I told my wife that she's crying and my wife reminded me that my daughter's car means a lot to her. So, AITA?

EDIT: Grammar and readability. 
EDIT 2: Cars are necessary here in Alabama. Her car had 225,000 miles on it and now has 250,000+ on it. I've fixed various problems on it multiple times over the years. I've told her to always keep me posted if the car is acting differently than normal."	Asshole	0	0
bvrt9q	2019-06-02 00:48:27	throwaway08081958	WIBTA if I ignored a coworker’s scheduling request, likely getting them demoted?	"So, the backstory: 

I started working at this place about a year ago, a couple of months after my coworker (we’ll call them B). At the time, we worked for an absolutely terrible manager who had no idea how to manage. B and I really didn’t like her, and she *knew* we didn’t like her, so she ended up giving B a “promotion” to try to drive a wedge between us. Not only did it not work, but B and I ended up continuing to do the exact same job; B’s title and pay changed, but our responsibilities were basically the same. 

Fast forward to about a month ago, Shitty Manager gets fired and Competent Manager gets hired. B is on vacation while CM is being onboarded, and given that I’m our most experienced employee apart from B, CM ends up leaning on me for a lot of stuff regarding policy changes, etc. Eventually, CM tells me that she wants to give me a promotion — the same one that B got several months ago — because she can see how good an employee I am, etc. The only thing is, CM would have to demote B to give me the promotion, and she needs grounds to do it. B is a student, so CM and I both were thinking that B’s schedule couldn’t accommodate the new hours that her position required, nbd, things should be wrapped up quickly. 

Well, when B got back from vacation, they ended up telling CM that their schedule could easily accommodate the new hours (min. 40/week + on call duties), and since CM doesn’t have B’s class schedule to confirm this, B is keeping the promotion and I’m staying at my current pay rate. 

Here’s the issue. B texted me this morning telling me that they have a schedule conflict, and they want me to give up my only regular day off (Tuesday) so that they don’t have to tell CM about the conflict and can keep the position. I’m pretty torn, because on one hand, B and I are friends and I want to help them out. On the other hand, I don’t think B earned the promotion — they only got it because our last manager was immature and shitty — AND I think it’s super problematic that B lied to CM about their availability. So, I’m leaning toward telling B that I can’t give up my day off and having them deal with CM and the repercussions of misrepresenting their schedule.

There was a big group of people standing outside of the car in the space next to me, probably a family, composed of about five or so adults and four teenagers. They were chatting and looked like they were just getting out of their car. I am a very cautious, experienced driver, so I know how important it is to back out carefully when there are people nearby.

I backed my car out very, very slowly, keeping my eye on all the people. A man in his late 50’s who was part of the group moved a bit closer to my car and started directing for me which way to go, when to stop, and when to go forward (which I was already doing 100 percent fine without his help). He did so in a forceful, commanding manner, like how a parent/officer might direct someone, and it was very annoying.

After a little while of him doing this, I rolled down my window and said to him loudly, “I’m not a fucking moron. I can back out of a parking space on my own.” His eyes got big and he backed off, going back to his group. I made my way out of the parking lot just fine after that.

I never even really tried to get with her (never flirted at all) 3. In the end I wanted to be with my girlfriend.

I still talk to said friend because we help each other with tasks and stuff and we’re also friends (not close but we still chit chat and whatnot)

But my SO has been getting so upset that I talk to her recently. She’s always been unhappy about it but recently it’s worse. 

She wants me to cut said friend out of my life and not talk to her at all. I said no because I think that’s unhealthy because I don’t think I’d do that to her. She said it’s because I used to like her and she’s attractive. But I told her first and foremost she’s straight, I don’t like her like that anymore, I chose my girlfriend over said friend and I certainly now don’t have a crush on her.

My girlfriend and I are planning to get engaged soon (both females, been together for over 4 years). We both want a very elegant wedding and plan on spending a pretty penny on it. I come from a farming background but I’ve moved away from it both physically and mentally. My family are straight up rednecks and I love them dearly but I honestly don’t trust them to dress themselves in a way that corresponds to the type of wedding I want to have. My girlfriends family is very classy and I have no concerns that they know how to dress properly. We both agreed we want a semi formal dress code but for my family that would still mean wearing jeans just ones that don’t have holes or stains. Would it be inappropriate to include a no jeans or work boots line along with “The brides request guests dress in semi formal attire” ?	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvrqkm	2019-06-02 00:40:38		AITA for not wanting trusting my mother 100%?	"This was from two or so years ago, but I still think about it a lot and want to know if I'm overreacting or something. 

About two years ago I was in a production of Annie with a theater group in my town. We performed a scene at a church one morning to promote the show to the people there (since the church is where we performed). I brought a few of my friends along, and after the performance, they complimented me on how well I did. The next morning, she was driving me to school early for a choir rehearsal. She said something to the extent of ""it was nice of your friends to compliment you when you didn't do very well"". I kept face until I got to school where I cried in the bathroom during the whole rehearsal and didn't sing a note. I still haven't sung alone in front of anybody unless it's got a purpose. 

Later that year, I received a rude comment from my ""friend"" saying my thighs were too big in PE. I mentioned it to my mom, saying it hurt my feelings. I also stated I had some issues with breathing during that period since we did a lot of running with no warming up. It's worth mentioning that I've always had breathing problems since I'm overly susceptible to colds and have large allergy attacks lasting up to two weeks in spring when this all happened. She gave me a snide remark about my body then, upsetting me further. 

This school year was also rough for me since I was struggling with sexual harassment at school. About five guys were consistently treating me awfully and cat calling my daily. One of them even chased my across the school when I said I wouldn't date him. I told my mother I was sick of it and was going to the counselor to talk about it. She told me nothing was going to happen since they were just being boys and nothing could be used against them for having a crush on me. 

This all came to a head that following summer. She confronted me on my deliberate avoidance of being alone with her for the past two or so months. I finally snapped and said everything she had said mentioned above had been bothering me and I hated how she had put me down when I was obviously excited or upset about something. She told me she had never said any of those things because she would never do such a thing. I don't quite remember how the argument ended in detail, but I wound up forgiving her. I wanted to get away after that to think, and since she doesn't think being uncomfortable is a good reason to end a conversation (""it's rude!""), I had to act like I forgave her. It's worth mentioning that she never apologized for what she said. 

I think about what happened that year a lot and feel awful about it all. Was I just overreacting or did she actually talk badly about me? 

Long story short: After months of tension, I got into an argument with my mother. She claimed to have never said what I brought up and didn't forgive me. AITA for still not trusting her completely?"		1	0

bvrps0	2019-06-02 00:38:08		AITA for leaving my (20M) date (20F) after she arrived at the diner with her child?	"So I am a college student, so is this girl. We met on Tinder and have been talking for a month or so. She said she didn't have an Instagram but did use Snap.

Anyway, fast forward to just a few hours ago, we met for the first time (we were both looking for a relationship and not a hook up). She is beautiful, smart, and charismatic. She had a very nice body too, although in some of her photos she had a 'weird line' down her abdomen that I figured was inappropriate ask about as I only knew her for a month.

So, we had plans for dinner tonight at a local diner. I got there before her, and went to a table. About five minutes later she comes. I was confused as I could almost 100% guarantee it was her but was like ""it can't be because this woman has a child"". Then, she comes up and says ""Jack?! Hey! It's Melissa"" I kinda nervously said ""hey.."" in a confused way. At first, I figured maybe she was babysitting or this was her unmentioned brother and thought wow she really is into me for still keeping our date (I don't mind kids as I am an elementary education major). Nope.

She said ""This is Mike, he's my son!"" I was shocked. I just looked at her and she said ""Yea, hes my bundle of joy. Had him at 18"" I said ""Are you serious?"" and she was like ""Yea!! But it's no big deal, if I put him on his iPad he wont make a fuss, and, by the way, sorry for never mentioning him! Sometimes things get hectic in my life""

I just stood up, looked at her and said ""I'm sorry, I don't think this will work out."" She was like ""..oh, but I really like you"" and I just said ""Im sorry"" and left.

Now, part of me feels dickish because I have never done that to a girl and try to hold respect for them, but I felt

1) totally lied to

2) betrayed (in a weird sense). I wanted to start my own family some day with a woman who hasn't had kids. Obviously if I was in my late 30s or 40s I would expect it, but I am just a college junior.... plus, I don't want to take on a 'father' responsibility should our relationship get serious over the next 2, 3 years

bvrpjk	2019-06-02 00:37:28	needsmoreserotonin	AITA for asking for a partial refund for unfinished clay classes?	"I joined an eight week clay class and started 4/27 with the provision that I’d have to move to a different city by 6/4. The classes are once a week which meant that I was two weeks short on time, but the instructor insured that I could double on classes for the last two weeks.

Everything was going well and I never skipped a class and went in multiple times a week for open studio to ensure that I could get my pieces done on time. Unfortunately, the instructor cancelled classes starting from 5/17 and won’t reopen until 6/3, the day before I leave. 

He has closed the studio for a weekend for a city fair, a week for air conditioning problems, and then another week for flood dangers. I’m understanding about things that are unavoidable, but nevertheless I haven’t been able to go in for over two weeks and don’t even have a finished teacup to show for my $175. AITA for asking for at the very least a partial refund?

Other notes: I’ve tried calling him multiple times about negotiating options but the line won’t go through. I’ve messaged his business through Facebook, and he’s read all of them but did not respond. He really is a nice and kind man, but it feels like he's ghosting me before my departure. My only option is to show up on Monday and confront him like a total Karen, which I’d hate to do.

This story happened a year ago, and it's really strange for me to think about it. Because i don't know if i am in the wrong or in the right.

My ex bf, boyfriend at the times, moved in my city for me, (i never ask him, one day, he said ""well, you can't move, so i will come for you). We were in a long distance relationship (about 400 Km distance). 

The day of the move was one week before my B-Day, and for my B-Day, i planned to go see my best friend, like four day after my b-day. He was really pissed after me, saying that i leave him alone in a new city etc. I was really upset and i decided to spent the week and my b-day with him. For helping him etc. (i was here for the move etc).  I finally go see my best friend and he had a complete breakdown. Crying, calling me names, say i was a monster to leave him etc. My mother take his side, and i learn recently that he lied to his parents about all the situation. Saying that i leave him for a unknown dude, without warning. His parents classed me as a dumb bitch who leave their son, for a dude. Heavily implies i was cheating. 

Thing to know 

\-It was my 18 birthday and in my country, it's a very important Birthday.

bvrogn	2019-06-02 00:34:31	Star_Statics	AITA for not making smoothies for my family?	"This is so trivial, but here we go.

I like smoothies. I make them all the time when I want an easy meal. I'm 18 year old full-time student living with my family, so when I make these smoothies I use the ingredients my family buys, which they have explicitly stated they don't mind me using for my personal meals.

However, my mother has a bizarre problem with this behaviour. I can make myself any kind of meal, but if it ever manifests in smoothie form she becomes furious that I don't share them with the whole family, or at least offer to make them all one. No other forms of food applies to this rule.

I've started working out and I often put expensive, personally-bought protein powder in my smoothies, so I explained to her recently that I'd rather not use my supplements in smoothies I make for the whole family. She delivered the rebuttal that I shouldn't be taking protein powder in the first place. 

This has become such a reoccurring, disproportional issue I cannot understand the importance of. Please tell me, am I an asshole for not making my family a damn smoothie?"	No A-holes here	0	0

bvrnv5	2019-06-02 00:32:49	RobbieTheRadical	WIBTA if I returned a very heartfelt gift my mother made me?	"Years ago, when I was still in high school, my mom put together this huge photo album of pictures of her, my dad, and me throughout my childhood.  She was clearly very proud of it, and I feel a bit bad that I’ve never liked it that much because it’s just not my thing.  It was a very sweet gesture, but I’ve always hated looking at photos of myself for one reason or another and didn’t get any positive feelings from it, if that makes sense.  Looking at the pictures made me uncomfortable, so I’ve only flipped through it maybe three times since she gave it to me, usually because she wanted me to or I felt otherwise obligated to.

Fast-forward to now and my life is very different.  I came out as transgender in October of 2018, but have known since I was very young.  Seeing photos of me when I presented female makes me extremely uncomfortable and I will not do it.  I know my mom put a lot of care into making the album, but I actively dislike it at this point and I don’t see myself ever looking through it again because of my dysphoria.

WIBTA if I gave it back to her?  I don’t want to hurt her feelings, but I’m not presenting female anymore and I want absolutely nothing to do with the parts of my life when I was.  This is a new part of my life where I’m finally being the man I’ve always known I am, and I want all reminders of who I was pretending to be completely gone."	Asshole	0	0

bvrmxf	2019-06-02 00:29:51	NiharaNao	WIBTA for not taking care of my coworker's pet while she is on vacation?	"For some background, I am known for caring for animals all around me, I have rescued turtles, cats and love to foster dogs and pet sit for my friends when they go on vacation. 

A couple of years ago I started to have severe problems with my lower back and knees that I take medication for,  but on the last 6 months or so it's becoming a nightmare. 

So since February of this year I've been fostering a dog until he is flying to Holland to his forever family, but he is a really easy dog to take care of. He is potty trained, very calm and well behavied, since he is 2 or 3 years old.  Now my coworker got herself a puppy, which she has not time to train for, and leaves him in his crate all day while she is working. She takes care of him over the weekends I know, but overall he really is a poor puppy with too much love and too much energy and nobody to care properly for him.  

She is leaving two weeks for her brother's wedding abroad and asked me to pet sit her dog. So I told her that if my fostered dog and him get along then I would. But I forgot how difficult is to take care of a puppy and how much attention they need. He just stayed over the weekend since she left for a company trip and I thought this would be a good time to try it out. The puppy is nice, he is playful and cuddly, but he is a puppy. Didn't let me sleep, of course he is not house trained and eats my fostered's food and water, as well as his. 

Honestly I can't wait for him to leave, he is too much work and 1) I am all hurt on my back and knees from cleaning all morning his last night's peeing and poo on my living room and 2) I haven't finish all the things I wanted to to this weekend and still have many more... I am way behind schedule. 

I can't imagine how would I be able to do this for 2 whole weeks, and I have decided to tell her I won't be taking him afterall. I feel really bad for the little fella, he is just a puppy, but in my mind you don't give a sick coworker your untrained puppy for two weeks. There is still about one week and a half for her to find someone else, but I am worried how people would be treating him. If she can't find anyone she would have to take him into a pet sitter shop but they mostly leave them in cages all day and just take them for walks. How is he going to be like that for over two weeks! I cry to only think about it, but I just don't have the patience or energy to take care of two dogs, one been an untrained puppy. WIBTA if I say no and try not to think about what's gonna happen to little puppy? I feel really bad just thinking about it 😢😭😭😭"	No A-holes here	0	0
bvrmm5	2019-06-02 00:28:53		AITA for getting defensive about religion ?	"Hello reddit ! 
I need you guys help to determine whether I’m in the wrong or in the right.
Today I had a huge fight with my sister,who insisted I should pray since today is a very special night in the Ramadan month so that god can bless/help me during my upcoming exams, I told her that it’s very hypocritical for me to do so since if I want to pray I need to do it for my religious duty and not for a selfish reason.
She then proceeded to claim that I have a hate bone for religion since I always get offended when it’s mentioned, I do agree that I do get a bit defensive about it since they usually gang up on me and start shoving their beliefs down my throat ( please note that I do believe in god but I’m not very vocal about my beliefs since I don’t feel the need to ? And the attacks I get for just saying things like ‘oh stop blaming your problems on god you are the reason behind the things that happened’ (please note it’s within a certain context that I say things like this )
She claimed that I’m an atheist and that she doesn’t want her sister to become a sinner,also that she will be heartbroken/sad if I ever become a non believer and she doesn’t want her sisters to not go to heaven with her.
Also that she isn’t willing to accept my open ideas and beliefs,I seriously don’t know what did that would trigger such a response from her ( I told her it’s non of her business and that it’s between god and me but she would just proceed to throw the ‘ YoU aRe An AtHeIst’ scheme at me ).
I’m so heartbroken that I’m being debilitated as something I’m not...I didn’t do anything wrong and now she doesn’t want to talk to me and claims that I’m a negative/bad person for having somewhat unconventional way to practice my religion.

bvrlzi	2019-06-02 00:26:56	PsychologicalMarch4	AITA for taking psychedelics for therapeutic use	"As you might know, some psychedelics have proven effective in medical use. They have healing effects treating for example anxiety and depression. They help break the thought loops that we normally cling into, enable us the mind to process the situation from different perspectives and see the world and everyone in it ""as one"". I understand that it's not everyone's cup of tea. It's not a shortcut to enlightment, but I find that they have worked as a catalyst on my pursuit of self improvement, self knowledge and spiritual growth.

My SO doesn't understand this point of view at all. He doesn't see any difference between using a psychedelic for the purpose of personal growth and smoking crack for getting fucked up just for hedonistic purposes. He doesn't aknowledge any ""noble motive"". To him it's nothing but hypocrisy and self-deceit. The whole concept of self improvement (with or without drugs involved) is strange to him. Our worldviews don't meet at all. My approach to this is spiritual. I admit it, it's also fuelled by curiosity, adventurousness and the need to temporarily rise above the triviality of everyday life. Still, I wouldn't call it a hedonistic experience because it also involves discomfort and careful preparation. Also the trip itself is not a walk in a park. If I was just chasing highs, it would be more enjoyable to stay at the home and take some Ecstacy.

Anyway, the idea of me going to this psychedelic retreat infuriates my SO. It's impossible to even talk about this. He doesn't even want to try to understand. According to him this is madness and just proves me an unbalanced and irresponsible person. I find that accusation unjustified because I've got my act together quite well (got a degree, a middle class office job, don't do drugs, drink very moderately, try to lead a healthy lifestyle, no mental health issues etc.).  I feel like this is what I want and need to do as a part of my personal development journey.  I'm planning to take it in a safe, controlled environment where it's not against the law. The substance doesn't harm the brain or health, has no addiction potential and is not possible to overdose. I have done this a couple times before on previous years.

However, from my SO perspective I'm being extremely selfish. He takes this as a deep personal offence. He's threatening to end the relationship because of this. We've been together for six years (not married, no kids and not living together however). It's hard for me to understand why would this hurt him so much. I'd understand his feelings if it was a sexfestival or something, but since that's not the case and I'm not pressuring him to participate, I don't understand why is it such a big deal for him. It's not ignorance; he's got recreational drug use in his past, including psychedelics, but no traumatising event related to them. I wish we could talk about this and he could help me understand better. According to him, it's obvious to everyone. Am I the asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Last year, my SIL gave my spouse and I a week’s access to their incredible lakefront property for a holiday. It was such a blessing. My spouse and I work hard, but there’s never a lot of money left at the end of the billing cycle, so we were stoked for it.

We knew the family was coming for a BBQ. We knew the teenaged niblings would pop in and out to see us. We knew my BIL was going to come by to cut the grass. What we didn’t know was that my MIL was going to come and stay the whole week without letting us know or even owning up to it.

It wasn’t hell, but it wasn’t relaxing. We couldn’t even do adult shit without having to sneak like teenagers, and we are well into our adulthood (you know... get busy). We had to feed her, too, which gets expensive when she asks you to pick up a couple boxes of wine, too. She slunk around all week with a guilty look, and we ignored it and had a decent but not very restful time. She was like some sort of camp counsellor, planning activities she wanted, and all I wanted to do was read in the lake - like, damn.

She doesn’t like me, but she doesn’t like anyone, really. I’m too young for my spouse, she thinks I’m too dweeby and weird, etc. She does like to spend time with my spouse, though, because we live far away - that was the main reason I didn’t outwardly begrudge anything. I’m not that hard hearted!

SIL wants to offer it to us again. She felt bad about not standing up for us, but to keep the peace, we didn’t say anything either. I thanked her and asked for a few days to confirm dates. My MIL texted me and my spouse to ask if we want to do it again, and I told my spouse to just not answer yet so we can sleep on it, but I really, really don’t want to do this again. I’d rather let my spouse go alone and I’ll stay home with the pets and bank hours at work, instead.

Will was required to attend court ordered rehab for his heroin addiction four years ago when Jack was only two. 

The judge didn’t want to completely cut my brother out of Jack’s life because he said that he had faith that Will can get better. The judge put him on parole for five years and Will had to submit to drug testing through a PO officer. If he failed any of his tests he will lose his partial custody of Jack and the judge also said that Will needed to complete his rehab and be sober for six months before he can see Jack. 

Well he completed rehab and he got partial custody of Jack with his ex. He has been sober for almost four years and has been nothing but a good father to Jack since. 

Me and Will have also remained close and I’ve tried to help him and check in on him and Jack when I can. 

Yesterday I entered Will’s house to drop off something. I have a key to his house and when I got there I needed to use the bathroom. I ended up throwing something in the bathroom garbage and I saw that he had hidden a syringe behind the toilet. 

At first I didn’t want to believe what I was seeing but it’s pretty obvious that Will has relapsed. I’m obviously devastated but I’m more worried about the safety of Jack. 

I am considering contacting Will’s parole officer and telling them my suspicions. If I’m right, Will could lose custody of his son and lose his job.

She tales care of him over the weekends I know, but overall he is really a poor puppy with too much love and too much energy and nobody yo care for properly for him.  

She is leaving two weeks for her brother's wedding abroad and asked me to pet sit her dog. So I told her that if my Foster dog and him get along then I would. But I forgot how difficult is to take care of a puppy and how much attention they need. He just stayed over the weekend since she left for a company trip and I thought this would be a good time to try it out. The puppy is nice, he is playful amd cuddly, but he is a puppy. Didn't let me sleep, of course he is not house trained and eats my fostered's food and water, as well as his. 

Honestly I can't wait for him to leave, he is too much work and 1) I am all hurt on my back and knees from cleaning all morning his last night's peeing and poo on my living room and 2) I haven't finish all the things O wanted to to this weekend and still have many more... I am way behind schedule. 

I can't imagine how would I be able to do this for 2 whole weeks, and I have decided to tell her I won't be taking him afterall. I feel really bad for the little fella, he is just a puppy, but in my mind you don't give a sick coworker your untrained puppy for two weeks. There is still about one week and a half for her to find someone else, but I am worried how people would be treating him. If she can't find anyone she would have take him into a pet sitter shop but they mostly leave them in cages all day and just take them for a walk. How is he going to be like that for over two weeks! I cry to only think about it, buy I just don't have the patience or energy to take care of two dogs, one been an untrained puppy. WIBTA if I say no and try not to think about what's gonna happen to little puppy? I feel really bad just thinking about it 😢😭😭😭"		1	0
bvriaq	2019-06-02 00:15:41	Pokegirloras	AITA for not offering food	"Not me but my dad. Our family had a discussion about this at dinner and I thought that it would fit the theme of the sub. Also a nice break from a lot of the recent validation-seeking posts.
What had happened was that my sister got a pet duck about 8 weeks ago and it started needing a bigger pen than what we already had because it was beginning to reach it's adult size. My stepmom's dad came over to make a permanent pen for it on the side of our house. He does jobs like these with furniture and that kinda stuff (my dad and stepmom pay him for it). When he comes to our house he sleeps here, gets breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.

So, my stepmom usually makes him lunch if she's here during the day or makes it in advance if she isn't, but this time she didn't. My dad has been working from home on the computer since November so he was at home but also busy. My dad didn't think to make him lunch for several reasons (which I'll list later in the post). When my stepmom came home she asked her dad if he had eaten lunch and he said he hadn't, prompting and argument. My brother and stepmom think my dad was in the wrong and me, my sister, and my dad think he was right. Here are the reasons

Dad was in the wrong:

He usually gets fed when he comes here so it's what he expects

He didn't want to be rude by asking for food

He's outside working for us, we should feed him

He's family, you offer family food when they're at your house

He also didn't want to open the refrigerator and eat or make something because that would be rude

Dad was in the right:

He's an adult, he can tell us if he's hungry

My dad skipped lunch to work because of how busy he was, he's not gonna drop what he's doing to make food for someone who hasn't said if he's hungry or not

He has a car, he can go out and buy food if wants/needs to

Even if he didn't want to be rude about it he could just say ""oh I'm going to take a break to go buy food"" and my dad could say ""oh no, I can make you something""

This ended in an ""agree to disagree"", our stepmom will just make him something in advance next time. So, is my dad TA?

I was recently added to a group chat for an event about 3 hours from me and after talking to everyone a bit, agreed to help drive everyone as not everyone had a license/a car that would make it that far safely. I stayed in the group chat for a couple of weeks, which was mainly composed of people I had graduated from high school with and had previously been friends with. Individually, I started trying to make plans with some of the people I had been closer to and was completely shot down, and it eventually got to the point that they would make plans together in the group chat and invite most of the members individually, but wouldn't ask if I was interested in going. I got tired of feeling rejected and eventually left the group chat. Since leaving, I've gotten quite a few messages asking why I didn't want to attend anymore.

bvrh5n	2019-06-02 00:12:28		WIBTA for giving our daughter formula, without telling my husband?	"We have a 9 month old daughter who has, up until this point, been raised on just breast milk.

Due to my levels of stress and my work not feasibly having enough flexibility for me to pump as much as I need to, my own supply has dwindled to almost nothing.

Through some wonderful mothers, we did have milk donated to us. However, our freezer supply is running out and these mom's have since weaned their babies.

I think our stash will last another month. So between 10 months and 12, we'll need to use formula, and then our pediatrician said we can graduate to cow's milk.

My problem is - my husband firmly believes wife's tales that say stupid stuff like drinking blue Gatorade will increase your supply. Trust me when I said I tried EVERYTHING. None of it works. It's simply how my body is. Every time I mention we'll have to start formula, he says ""no, we need you to get back on (whatever voodoo stuff he's picked that day)"". I tell him we did that and it didn't work. He says we'll try again, and refuses to give our baby formula. He says he ""does not want a formula baby"". He thinks it's inferior.

WIBTA if I start introducing a little formula in her meals each day, so that way we can have a mixed transition instead of cold turkey? With the rate my husband is being obstinate, he'll refuse up until we're out and she's due a bottle. She's an agreeable baby but I feel that'll cause undue stress.

TL;DR dad doesn't want to give baby formula for 2 months, we don't have any other options, I want to slowly transition with a mix in secret because otherwise he'll refuse."		1	0

bvrdqd	2019-06-02 00:02:36		WIBTA	Should I let a girl at my old workplace know her husband is cheating on her? I travel alot for work. And on one of my trips I met a guy who was funny and very sweet.(we will call him josh) We became pretty close friends. We would be together all the time at work and hangout after. One night we were talking about our favorite places we had traveled and one of his was Las Vegas because he met a girl and had a exciting weekend with her a couple months back. We got even closer and we started talking all the time until I found out he was married by a friend and so I talked to Josh about it and asked if I was crazy to think we had something more then friendship. He told me that I wasn't crazy he felt it and really liked me so we decided that we would be work friends but not hangout anymore. We talked about how he felt that he cheated on his wife (who was his fiance at the time) with someone and he said he did regret it and did love her. And that she worked in the same building we worked at as well. But we stayed friends and nothing happened between us. I enjoyed all the people I worked with but one woman who was twice my age hated me. She wouldn't look at me or speak to me even if it was about work. Whenever Josh and I where around each other she would come pull him into another room or wrap around him. I thought it was her being materialistic with Josh. I left my work trip after about 2 months and Josh and I talked once or twice. I was caughting up with a friend who worked with all of us and she told me the reason this woman didn't like me was because she knew that Josh and I were close and they had slept together about a year ago and she wanted to be with him. I feel terrible for his wife she has no idea and he already cheated on her twice that I know of and he was willing to lie and try to start something with me until I found out and stopped it. He already started something with someone at work. The same place his wife works at. And I don't know if I should tell her or not.	Not the A-hole	1	0
bvrdew	2019-06-02 00:01:43	taintsrowthe3rd	AITA for cutting off an old flame?	"First post, so sorry if I do something wrong. But this has been bugging me for ages and I need some feedback. 

AITA for cutting off contact with an old flame?
A couple of years ago I met this really wonderful girl who helped drag me out of the sad boi cesspool I was in, made me understand that I'm beautiful, special, and valuable just as I am, and on the whole helped me learn to be a normal, functioning, almost confident adult. 
When we started hanging out, we were both very clear that it was casual. Neither of us were ready for anything comitted and we both just needed company to get through the dark times we were facing. She was with me through some tough episodes, I was with her through her grandfather's death, we held each other and cried on each other's shoulders...100% the best human interaction I've ever had with anyone in my life. 
She told me she loved me one night, and I said I loved her too, and in the midst of the chaos of this dive bar we were in, we both knew that we did love each other, but that things still hadn't changed between us. We just held each other more dearly in regard than before. 
She moved away for a better job, and about 6 months later so did I. We kept in touch. I have flight benefits so we saw each other off and on. 
Then, she got on Keto and lost a ton of weight and was doing so wonderfully well and all of a sudden she was swarmed in people vying for her affections. She would call and tell me about it and I would listen and laugh and give her advice and be her friend. 
But then one day I told her I missed her (it had been a few weeks since we talked). She called me and very gently told me she was in love, and that they were happy, and she didn't say it, but I heard the unspoken ""please don't message me anymore"" in her voice. 
This really super sucked because about a month before I'd said ""Hey, I know this is the worst thing I could possibly say, but...I think I'm ready now. And I can't imagine trying with anyone but you. And if you're ever open to a partner, I'd like to be on your list.""
So I tried not to contact her...ended up breaking down twice and finally I told myself ""you have to delete her information from your phone or you'll never let her have peace."" So I removed her from social media, deleted her number, and made sure I had no way to dig it up again, because I didn't want to intrude into her life without me.

But I can't shake the feeling that I'm a giant asswipe for doing this. And I know the internet isn't the best way to get advice, but...what do you guys think? Did I do the right thing? Or AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My artist and I have a good relationship, we generally have a good time during sessions, she's done fantastic work, and we've never really discussed money that much.  So if I am an asshole, I don't know if she just doesn't want to bring it up or if she's not mad or what but things seem ok.

I had honestly never even heard of or thought about giving a tip until I was talking to a friend of mine who had just had some work done at the same shop with a different artist.  When she told me that she paid $700 for a tattoo of a similar size but less detail of pieces that cost me about $4-500 I was quite taken aback.  I asked her if they charged her the shop wide hourly rate and she confirmed so, and said that she also tipped 30%.  She said it like it was obvious and standard operating procedure.  She did mention that the artist himself seemed pretty surprised about it as well.

So am I an asshole for not having tipped all this time?  I mean I pay $120 an hour in a city where cost of living is such that that would pay a half month's rent for a 500 square foot 1 bedroom, or a month's groceries for two people.

bvrbic	2019-06-01 23:56:21		AITA for not wanting to go to my son's doctor's appointments because his step dad would be there	"So my ex and I have one child together he's 8 months old currently and we haven't been together for quite awhile, we probably split around her 3rd month of pregnancy. We also came to the decision that I can see my son Sun-Tue one week and the following week Sat-Tue. And since my son is young she's more than welcomed to hang out while he's with me. Ok here's where it gets interesting. Recently my ex got married to her ex-fiance im kind of hurt but it's her life, her decision, I can't do anything about it.

Now everytime my son has had a doctor's appointment my ex and I go together just because we still get along and we co parent pretty well.

We recently ran into the issue about my son's periodic check ups, and how her now husband wants to attend every doctor appointment. I explain to her im not comfortable with that and it should just be the two of us since we're his parents I also explained to her that yes I still love her and to see her be with another man it hurts me I know we're not getting back together but it still bothers me. She tells me to stop being jealous and that he is a part of my son's life and to get over it.  I don't argue with her on that point, he has a right to attend the doctor's appointments. Now my argument to her is why does her husband have to come to the doctor's appointments on my scheduled days, it's my time with my son and I want to be comfortable and not feel weird. If the appointment lands on their half of the week that's fine I don't have to go. She tells me im more than welcomed to join them but she's always going to bring her husband and if I can't get over that then it looks like I won't be attending the appointments anymore. She also said they weren't a big deal its not important if I go or not, so i tell her based on that logic it shouldn't be a big deal for her husband to attend them either. 

It's feels like she's forcing me to meet her husband, and to be fair I actually tried going with them once and it was really awkward. Everybody was just quiet and even the doctor was confused at the situation."	Asshole	1	0

I relocated across the country with just one year of experience in my field, and have had a tougher go than I had anticipated. Money has gotten extremely tight at this point and I have amassed a bit of CC debt in the process. (0 interest CC luckily). I agreed to this temp position about a month ago, started last Wednesday, and accepted an offer on Friday for a permanent position starting in two weeks. My dilemma is, I really need the $ I would earn over the next two weeks at this temp job. If I gave notice to this temp position and was immediately terminated (this is a strong possibility since I haven't been there but 3 days), I would be digging myself in a deeper hole that I would rather avoid. This is not a life or death industry, there is an entire department that can take on the duties I am covering/training for, and the first week is the only busy time of the month for this position, which I would be here for.

bvraci	2019-06-01 23:52:57		WIBTA if I (27F) asked my friend (25M) to properly reject me?	"I fear I would be asking him to do something selfish and difficult solely for my mental health, so here's the story:

I met Nate 3.5 years ago when we were in a small grad school program. When we got assigned to work in a group for a project, I developed a crush on him. Regardless, we became friends because we loved the same music, TV shows, movies, and games. We also had similar values. It's easy to see how I developed a crush here. After 5 months, I finally admitted my feelings to him.

I was rejected. His rejection was wishy-washy. He's a religious guy, so it was along the lines of ""God not wanting us together right now"", but he assured me I was beautiful and intelligent. There was a lot of mention of not wanting something right now, but then there was a brief strange mention of trying to work something out with another woman. Regardless, that implies something for the future, right? If it didn't work out with her?

We continued being good friends.

Near the end of school, I'm applying to every design job that shows up on LinkedIn, etc. Nate easily got a job in a midwest city that's not particularly known for design jobs. The only job offer I got was in the city that Nate is in. I take it.

We continue being friends, but shortly after I move there, he became distant. I learned during the first week of my job that he's dating someone. It was the woman he'd been holding out five years for who happened to be in this city. It lasted 3 weeks. He remained friends and claims to not have feelings for her.

A few months after, we ended up on the topic of rejection. He told me that rejecting me was the hardest thing he's done and he ended up running four miles on a treadmill in an attempt to overcome how horrible he felt. I didn't know how to respond, so I changed the subject. I wish I asked how it's possible to feel horrible rejecting someone you didn't even like. 

Once Nate got a dog, we became even closer. We hang out even more, almost 4/5 out of 7 days in a week. My feelings for him return and I realized they never went away. I kept holding out because of his wishy-washy rejection always implied I had a chance in the future. Because of that, any time I tried to find any interest in a man, I felt like I was ""cheating"" on Nate, even though we're not in a relationship. Looking back on the past three years, I've completely felt like I was cheating and it's kept me from dating at all.

If we're to go by the stories I've told my co-workers and long-distance friends, they'd say he's interested in me to some degree. But that's just reading into things with no context. So who knows?

I think that if I ask him to reject me in a way that's permanent and absolute, I can finally move on. Our friendship won't suffer, I believe. But given the prior statement of how hard it was to reject me, I don't know if it's okay to throw this on him all of a sudden."		1	0

Our only parent in the house is my mother and she ignores him most of the time - when I get her to tell him to stop screaming she speaks extremely nicely more than I could ever do and he still responds the same way to his mother (he mindful when you tell him to stop screaming he won’t stop telling you to shut up until he is the last person talking so these arguments go for on a while) 

A few weeks ago he asked me to help with his assignment I agreed thinking maybe if I help him he would help me by being more mindful when he plays video games (never once have I asked him to stop playing games I always compare him to me or my other brother when he play games saying how we never scream or cuss when he plays even when we were his age) 
After I helped him he didn’t get any better he actually got worst

Today he asked me for help with his assignment and I said no and also saying how now that he wants something from me he acts all nice but when I want him to shut up or not scream when he plays video games he tells me to shut up or fuck of. My mum was there and she got pissed with me and called me an asshole and selfish 

When I confronted my brother and said “do you ever listen to me when I ask you to not scream” he said no then I said “than why should I help you?” He got pissed and his defence was if I had shut up he would have eventually shut up. And he also said he doesn’t like being told what to do

So am I the asshole for this? I’m kinda 90% sure I’m not but what do you guys think? My mum honestly cannot control this kid to save her life she barely cares enough to stop him the only times she asks him to stop screaming is when I ask to do so

**Edit: I had a talk with my brother he was silent - I talked to him about his screaming and how that isn’t right etc and I made him acknowledge it (kinda) by saying “do I ever scream?” and I waited for his answer when he said “no” then I asked more “Does xx ever scream?” “Then why do you?”  I basically said the next time I ask him to stop screaming he better stop etc - I ended up helping him with his homework - ignoring him isn’t gonna help him but I hope if I keep talking to him to does and he stops**"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bvr8za	2019-06-01 23:49:00	TOWTTD	AITA for asking my colleague/friend's ex girlfriend for sex?	"For some context, she's my colleague and my flatmate's ex grilfriend. My flat mate and I are from the same college and old friends, we took different career paths for a while after graduating but then I moved in with him when I decided to switch jobs. \[REDACTED\] was my friend's girlfriend at that time, they worked in the same company. She thought it was serious and he didn't. I basically witnessed their relationship fall appart over a period of a couple of months. I wasn't working with either of them at this point but I came to know her well because of how often she would come visit.

Fast forward two years, my friend recomends me to a position in the same company. I haven't seen her in two years at this point. We develop a very strange kind of relationship. She's not comfortable talking to me in front of everyone else because she thinks everyone knows about her and my roomate and she wouldn't want it to seem like ""she's out to fuck the whole team"". Her words. But on company retreats and team lunches we would find some space and have personal conversations. She was in another relationship at this point that was not going well. She'd tell me about the dude. I told her about my past issues.

Fast firward one year, we have been colleagues for a year. My friend has been is in the same company. She's had a breakup and is single. One day I tell him that I have been having these conversations with his ex girlfriend for a year and if it's cool by him if I ask her out. My friend tells me he does't mind so long as I don't go and tell her he told me so. So, I go and ask her out. She says all the good things there are to me but declines to be in a relationship with me mostly because she thinks it would be awkward with her ex.

Fast forward one week. I am drunk out of my mind (again, not an excuse) and equally horny and in no fit state to talk to another human being but I somehow decide that it'd be a good idea to talk to her. I dial her up and ask her if she'd like to have sex with me since that clearly wouldn't involve us being in a relationship that needs to be disclosed to the world. She asks me if I have gone mad and disconnects the call. \[I know, I am wierd\]. Next day in the moring I call her and ask her if she can have lunch with me so that we can talk over this. She says I hurt her. She would like to not talk to me anymore and disconnected she also told me that she's really hurt by my words. I have respected her wishes. So, the question is I am clearly a weirdo but was I being an asshole in my actions?"	Asshole	0	0

bvr7to	2019-06-01 23:45:45	nintendo_d_s	AITA for basically giving my grandma depression for cutting my dad out of my life?	"So I haven't talked to my dad for over a year now, and my grandma has serious issues with that. Here's some backstory, it's a bit long so please bare with me.

My parents are separated (never married) and I have lived with my mom my entire life. My dad has been around but mostly working out in the bush for weeks at a time and living somewhere else from us. I'd visit him a bit throughout the years, every summer or for Christmas and all that. 

Last year my dad met his current girlfriend and I actually quite liked her. She and him were living together in a city that's about 1.5 hours away, so I could easily go see him whenever. I had visited him for Christmas 2017 and stayed until the new year. All was fine then, he had cut down on his drinking and was doing a little better for a bit. He then asked me to come back to see him in March of 2018.

When he called me to ask me to come visit him he was drunk on the phone, but I paid this no mind because it was normal at this point. He then told me his gf was pregnant (and they had only been together for about 4 months at the time). This made me uncomfortable and I changed my mind about coming to see him, and he freaked out on me. Started calling me awful names and accusing me of being selfish. I didn't talk to him for a while after this.

My birthday came the next month and at the time the kitchen at my mom's house was being renovated. Because of this we were at a friend's house cooking dinner on my birthday. My dad has texted me happy birthday, and I responded with a simple ""thanks"", just so I wouldn't forget to text him back as we were busy. Exactly 3 hours later that night I get a huge paragraph about how I am a selfish bitch for not saying other than thanks and for not calling him on my birthday. 
I tried to be mature and I politely asked him to respect me but he would not listen, being a total asshole to me on my sweet 16. 

Since then I haven't talked to him at all, and I changed my phone number and didn't give him the new one. My family knows not to tell him my number and everyone is respectful of my choice to cut him out of my life. 

But.

My grandma (dads mom) has a real problem with my situation with my dad. She has gotten depression from it and can't talk about it without crying. She's always guilt tripping me and complaining about it. I sort of understand because her daughter basically disowned her years ago and she claims to not know why, and the daughter has also kept her from talking to her granddaughter and grandson. 

I have a real reason for not talking to my dad, and my grandma doesn't seem to care that he is a cunt to me and she only cares about the fact that we don't talk. 

AITA for making her depressed? 

TLDR; my dad was a cunt to me for a long time and I cut him out, and this has made my grandma very sad and depressed and I feel like it's my fault."	No A-holes here	0	0
bvr7fx	2019-06-01 23:44:45	katieb97	AITA for making fun of a friend of mine (25), because she's dating an 18 year old?	"For a bit of context, she's a professional athlete in a sport or at least was, but now for multiple years had many injuries and surgeries. I'm saying that, as because of her talent in this sport she never went to College and didn't have much to do with boys in general, even though she objectively is really beautiful and attractive and a really good girl in general. 

Now when she was in rehab from her surgery or did normal gym work, I'm not sure, she met a boy  and now is dating him for a few months. He seems to be really cute, mature and caring, but he's still a little boy way too young for her in my eyes and she acts like he's perfect and everything she ever needed. 
So Thursday when we were meeting for dinner she again told me how good he is for her, what he does for her, what kind of gifts he makes her (from his rich parent's money I suppose) and some things I didn't wanna know like how she loves kissing and fondling his abs and stuff like that, I said something like ""so he's a good boytoy for you, huh?"" and told her to get a MAN in her age instead of using a little boy like as if she's a HS girl. 
Now yesterday we talked on the phone and she asked me if I was serious with what I said, and when I meant yeah, she got really mad and told me I'd be a ""jealous slut"" and would want her to ""die without finding a guy"" that would make her happy..."	Asshole	0	0
bvr7di	2019-06-01 23:44:35	Volucia	AITA for accepting a free ride ?	"(Before starting, english is not my first language so sorry for the mistakes)

I'm a high schooler (Female - 18 yo) living in the countryside in a small city (named A). I go to a high school in a nearby city(named B).

I live in the ""country side"" so 90% of people have a driving licence. (I'm talking about adult)

My family is not very rich. I'm currently living with my father and my two brothers (19 yo and 16 yo). My father don't work or work illegally.

I have a close friend (Female - 18 yo ) who go to the same school, living in the same city, and going to the same party as mine. 

But, the problem is when the party is in another city or when we finish school at the same time, instead of calling my father to come get me, my friend can take me to A. And I just walk to my house. But my friend's parent just take me to my home. (It's not far from their house but they need to take an another road.

Important thing to know, it's not me who ask my friend to take me home. We just talk about it during lunch and she ask me if I want her parent to take me back to be polite because we finished at the same time. 

It's happen a few times and she always ask me if I want them to take me home. I always accept because she ask and it suits me. After a few months, she understand that she was too kind and stop asking. Her parent was also upset that they were a ""taxi"" for everyone.

But it didn't stop here. We have a lot of party in other city (named C) and we are invited together. So just one parent can take us there. My father can't never bring us at C because he work or I don't want him to take us there because it's cost to much money or it's brother him too much. (I know i'm selfish). So i always end up asking her because her parent are retired. (Sometimes I ask other time she ask)

It's always pass, and I feel bad because i was using them. When we ask about going somewhere the first thing who come to me is who is going to take me there in the guest list (who live in A). 


I already know that i'm an asshole for that BUT ! Tonight thing were different. I started to ask my brother to take us at party or school. So tonight we had a party in another city (more like a concert for everyone). 

The deal was the parent of my friend take us to the party and my brother come to get us at the party to go home. The things is that the parent of my friend didn't go home and decided to stay for the concert.  But if they stay why do my brother come to get us when her parent can just take us home at the same time? I don't understand...

They are other things who happen but it's been too long so just ask question in the comment for more information.

&#x200B;

I was ordering food at a kisok thing and this guy comes up to me, I'd say early 20s-mid 30s, very disheveled looking, full beard and all black clothes.

Him: I like your hair.

Me: Thank you. (avoiding eye contact and giving off very im-uncomfortable body language)

Him: Do you like movies?

Me: Um, I guess?

Him: Can I take you to one?

Me: Nope, get away from me.

&#x200B;

I was shaking really bad and panicky and he said sorry and went back to his table, but I feel so bad for saying ""Get away from me"", and my parents both told me I shouldn't have been so rude. My gut instinct was telling me to run, and my brain was screaming that I was in danger, but I feel like I could've been nicer, and just said, ""No, thanks."" I'm really torn up about this.

EDIT: I'm a male.

bvr6kk	2019-06-01 23:42:19	HeathenJack	AITA for wanting to attend a concert instead of my cousin's graduation?	"For context, I (24m) am somewhat estranged from my family. I was close to my cousins growing up, but since I moved away from my hometown in 2014, we've drifted apart.

We still see each other at events like Thanksgiving and Christmas, but other than that, there's zero contact. I don't contact them, they don't contact me. There's been no attempt and no complaints about this to me.

Some of my younger cousins are graduating high school this year, and I'm pretty confident that the older members of my family expect me to go to the graduation ceremony.

When I graduated high school, they were present, but I didn't give a fuck, and I'm pretty sure they didn't either. As far as I was concerned (and still am), it was a mediocre achievement, and I just wanted it to be over with so that I could leave and go do my own thing.

On the date of their graduation, there's a band playing in town that I really, really like, and I'd rather go see this show with some friends, but I also don't want to hurt my family if I don't have to.

Tl;dr: I'd rather go see a show than sit through a graduation that I don't care about, but if sitting through it is the right thing to do, I'll do it."	No A-holes here	0	0

"Long story short, I broke up with my ex 3 years ago, and for the past year he’s been randomly texting/calling me for advice and emotional support. A few days ago he called me and went on and on about his problems with a guy he’s interested in for an hour to the point where he gave me his address and asked me to call the police if I don’t hear from him for a few days. Yesterday he messaged me 7+ texts about how he tried to break up with the guy and it went downhill. My reason for not wanting to care anymore is our relationship didn’t end very well, but I decided not to hold any grudges. As he’s telling me about his relationship problems he mentions many things that he does/doesn’t want to do that he never considered while we were dating, the main thing being that he purposely ignored me for 3 months before we broke up but doesn’t want to leave the guy he’s interested in hanging without a “nice” reason for not wanting to talk to him anymore. 

I’m not the jealous ex kind of person, I’ve been giving him advice and listening to his problems for over a year now. But hearing that he’s perfectly ok with not giving me a single text for 3 months WHILE DATING, and feels “super super horrible and like an asshole” if he doesn’t reply to the guy really ticked me off.

bvr4op	2019-06-01 23:37:00		AITA Not enough make up vs too much makeup	Let me give you a little background my boyfriend and I have been together for three years. Best relationship I have ever had. Everytime we go out he tells me are you wearing makeup and I would say no and he would replay with when we started dating u used to wear makeup. So for his work Christmas Party I got out of work early got my nails done and my makeup done at a salon. He gets home in a rush becuasr he got out of work late and he only has 30 mins or so to get ready. He looked at me and said that's too much makeup and makes a face like it looks horrible. I felt like at looked amazing so obviously he hurts my feelings and I said I was not going anymore we argue for the whole 30 mins. He apologized and made me feel bad for over reacting and making miss his work party which was important for his career as his boss had asked him to be there. That was one of the lowest point of our relationship so as you can see compared to my friends relationship I am in heaven. Today is his nephew graduation I get ready early and do my makeup and he looks at me and says that I am wearing too much mascara and that I should take it off. You would think he should know better so  I got mad and told him told him my make up is none of his business and if he is embarrassed I dont have to go. Now he is mad that we might miss his nephew's graduation. Am i over reacting? Am I the asshole for feeling bad?		1	0
bvr3ue	2019-06-01 23:34:38	queenofstarts	AITA for making my BF walk out of a movie he's been dying to see?	"Background: BF is really into movies whereas I am not. It takes a lot for me to get into them and he complains that I never want to watch movies with him.

Enter today -- BF has been dying to see John Wick 3 for weeks. He had a wisdom tooth removed today and also was feeling down about our dog's passing so he asked if we could see the movie today. I agreed and he bought tickets. The only seats left were in the front row.

We get popcorn and wait to get seated and I can tell he's so excited to finally see the movie.

We sit down, and the previews are starting...and I realize that the closeness of the screen combined with the quick movement is triggering my motion sickness. (Certain movies and video games cause me to feel nauseous) I try to look away but it's getting worse. BF asks if I'm OK and and I say that I'm feeling sick (he knows about my motion sickness) and he asks me if I want to leave. I decide to stick it out but realize it's getting worse. 

He jumps out of his seat, says ""We're leaving"" and storms out of the movie, throws the full bag of popcorn in the trash, and bolts out the door. We sit on a bench and he refused to even look in my direction. 

It's been about 45 minutes and we're home, and he has barely said two words to me. I feel like I should have just kept my eyes closed or maybe suggested if we could exchange our tickets for another day none of this would have happened.

AITA?

Edit: After he stormed out, I offered to go home in an Uber and he could stay and watch the movie. He didn't say anything to me.

Edit 2: We spoke about it and he said he was upset because he felt ""I was making a scene in public"" at the movies. I explained my side and he apologized for making me feel bad. I appreciate all the comments though: gave me a ton of insight! Also, there are a lot of judgy people on Reddit =/"	Not the A-hole	0	0

So today 1st of June there was the Champions League final between Liverpool and Tottenham, and I really wanted to watch that game.
My parents were watching a movie together in the living room TV so I didn't want to bother them.
I then wanted to watch it in my room in a much smaller TV but it had broken like a month ago and I was waiting for the replacement.
I proceeded to my sisters room to watch the game there as both of them were gone at that moment. I watched almost the whole game until 15 minutes before it ended my first sister came back. 
She angrily asked me what the hell I was doing in her room and told that the game was going to end in like 15 minutes 
She kicked me out while causing a scene in front of my parents. 
My other sister arrived after like 30 minutes later, and when she was aware of the incident she was furious creating a bigger scene than the previous..
I sarcastically replied that it was nothing and they were overreacting, something that made them angrier.
Note that the TV was mine and I gave it them because I didn't have any use to it. Also note that they didn't even use the TV it was just sitting there collecting dust.

Personally I don't think I did something wrong but their reaction seems like otherwise.

So, I'm having a night over with my girlfriend's family and we were playing some board games. My gf goes to the bathroom. I'm on good terms with the mother, I'm dating the girl for almost 2 years and it's a very nice relationship imo. So, we're left with the mother and the brother (the brother wasn't joining the conversation at all) and she starts singing a song I honestly don't know. Then she proceeds to say: ""I have a theory about this song"". I answer: ""I should listen to the lyrics first to listen for any theories"", she's like ""how can you not know this one?!"", her voice getting higher, honestly. I said that I should listen to it and maybe then I would recognize it. She proceeded to repeat the thing about it being weird that I don't know it, but put it on on youtube. After hearing it, I still don't know it, politely saying something like ""nope, haven't heard it or just can't remember it right now"". She continues to say stuff like how could someone not know this song, laughing. I didn't react to it at the moment, but after a couple of minutes I started singing songs that she wouldn't know for sure, saying stuff like ""I've read a good theory on this one.."" she said absolutely nothing and honestly looked pissed. 


The girlfriend came back, we continued to play the board game. She was there when my singing and saying that stuff happened, it didn't look like anything at all for her, since she didn't see the exchange before. Everything went normally, but after wrapping up and going to bed, my gf told me that her mother got mad because of the song thing and I should've let it slide because she's always like that (they had a few whispers, keep in mind that she was in the bathroom at the time).

It was not like I was very hurt by the ""making fun"", and didn't do the same in mean will, it just popped in my head and I did it. I don't think people should be doing this and I didn't go the polite ""saying what you don't like out loud"" route.

We're literally halfway across the world and we've been dating for about a 1 year and half now. We've met up a couple times and we have plans on her moving in with me here by end of this year. 

Her lease is coming up so she'll be moving in with her brother instead of renewing the lease. Her current living situation is that she lives with her ex gf of 3 years. I didn't find out until after a year of us dating. And she explained to me that when we met they were already basically broken up. The ex was already dating some guy, and that she has already moved on months before we started talking but she kept it hidden from me because she didn't want that to hinder what we have. 

After she told me a few months ago, at first I was so bothered and I would think about the times when she would tell me how a couple times they've cuddled to help each other sleep. But my gf assures me she doesn't care for her. 

The ex treats her badly, doesnt talk to her at all ever since the ex found out about me back when we first started dating. We video call all the time and the ex would always leave the room (oh yeah they share a room and bed) whenever we video call. My gf always complains to me about how she is always paying for everything, the ex doesn't pay rent and very rarely does she ever contribute any money towards anything. However she is proactive around the house, cleaning and washing and cooking. Just recently she stopped doing as much. 

The thing that torns me is the ex has no where to go, I'd feel bad. The ex now has a gf but i don't know the situation whether the ex's gf is willing to accomodate the ex. The ex has a job but i don't think it's enough to support herself, the past 4 years my gf has always provided for her. And to top it off the ex's father has cancer. It would be pretty shitty if she doesn't have somewhere to stay but at the same time I feel like she's overstayed her welcome.

TLDR: I trust my LDR gf whole heartedly despite myself getting jealous at the thought of them staying under the same roof and bed. I know she would never do anything, I just feel uncomfortable plus the ex always taking advantage of my gf to the point that my gf would just give in so that there's no drama.

bvqz28	2019-06-01 23:20:45		AITA for telling my best friend to fuck off?	"Myself, my partner and friends were going out one night.

10 mins before we were due to meet up, me and my partner had a disagreement. We didn’t get to talk it out because our friends arrived. So we stepped aside to chat when we got to the event.

Something was said that upset me to the point that I didn’t want to be there because I was crying, and who wants to be that person? Me and my partner agreed I’d go back to the house (5 min walk away).

After a while, I started panicking that the disagreement was a bigger deal than it was so I texted my partner to check we were okay. No response until an hour later. It was one of our friends (Sarah). My partner had given their phone to Sarah to put in her bag so it didn’t get lost (a reasonable thing, they lose things...a lot). I asked Sarah to have my partner call me, she said she’d go find them.

Half an hour goes by - nothing. I text again asking if she found them, she responds saying she felt it was best I didn’t talk to them tonight - she was going to have them stay with her for the night (same house as my partner’s).

At this point, I’m panic-y. I’m a nervous person and being told by my friend that she wasn’t going to give my partner their phone until the morning was a lot.

I called to ask her again, she started saying I shouldn’t talk to them because they’d had a lot to drink. I said I’ll come back to the bar, because I need to talk to them and you’re not giving them their phone back.

When I arrived, I saw Sarah and she cornered me. She told me to leave, she wasn’t going to tell me where my partner was because she didn’t want me to speak to them. I explained that I was anxious and I needed to talk through some things with them to clear the air. 

This is when she starts saying that they’ve had a lot to drink and “they’re over there...y’know....TALKING to another girl”. She repeated this multiple times, if you can’t guess,  she was trying to imply that they were cheating on me. 

I remained as calm as someone having an anxiety attack can. I told her I loved her but I needed her to get out of my way, seeing as she wasn’t going to help. She didn’t move, so I shoved by her, she grabbed me and tried to corner me again. This is when I said “fuck you, Sarah. Fuck off.”  

I found my partner, who was not cheating on me. We sorted everything out in a few mins because it had been nothing. 

Sarah pulled my partner aside to say she’d crossed a line and would apologise to me the next day. Then went home.

The next day, she was texting my partner all day, but I heard nothing. That night I heard her come into the house. I’d been anxious about it all day, so I decided to go to her to initiate a conversation about it. I went to her door, she opened it, I smiled, said hi. Her response was “I can’t talk to you” and shut the door in my face. 

This was months ago, and that was the last thing she said to me.

Cancel order, probably need to rethink the exhaust system anyways (bmw, needs ecu tuning to accommodate new data from different cat-converter) 
So I simply say ok and that was that. 

I never get on her about anything. Ever. If she does something that pisses me off, it really only ever lasts 5 minutes and then I’ve forgotten what the whole fiasco could have been about.

"To preface with some background this was an ongoing issue a few years back where they’d call my cell and my land line repeatedly until I picked up. We talked about it and they agreed to follow up with a text rather than multiple calls. A few months ago she explained that do not disturb mode can be bypassed by calling twice within a few minutes.
Current issue: Thursday morning I had my phone on do not disturb to catch up on sleep as I’d been up with a toothache most of the night. Friend called twice and the second call came through. I didn’t pick up, and I didn’t say anything. Today it happened again. This time I followed up with a text. I was blunt, but I don’t think my text deserves even close to the amount of vitriol I’ve gotten back. My text said “Please stop double calling to get around my having do not disturb on. I have it on for a reason.“ she’s reapinded by calling me disrespectful, telling me to fuck off, and acting like the fact that she loaned me money this week, and that I didn’t answer today means I have no respect for her. Idk I really don’t feel like the loan has anything to do with the over calling, and it’s been well established that it’s not something I want her to do. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

After a year-ish, someone moved across from me. ""Braydon"". We were good friends and had fun a lot. His parents were divorced, which I knew might effect his personality.

Well about 5 or 6 months ago, he did a bit of a thing. In our neighborhood me and some other kids had a ""fort"". It was really just a small clearing of trees with a creek. We recently started construction on a small wooden hut/ overlook. Now as you can imagine, you need a hammer, nails, and maybe even a saw (we had a saw) to make a wooden hut. 

Well one day, me and braydon went to the fort. We actually had a conversation earlier that day, and it basically went like this:

Braydon: a lot of kids call me the cop kid, and I don't really know why.
Me: maybe because your dad is a cop and they think you would tell on them.
Him: yeah but I would never do that. 

So we go to the fort and he sees hammers and saws and nails (not spilled all over the place, neatly contained) and freaks out. Not a huge one but there were other kids there with the construction stuff and he just got scared and ran home. Well guess what happens a few hours later? The cop dad shows up at our door and talks to my mom and dad about the fort.

I was banned.

He has done other stupid stuff and I don't want to end the friendship because I'm awkward and I would have a hard time doing it, but I just can't hold on to this forever.

bvqter	2019-06-01 23:04:50	peregrine-purple	AITA for how I reacted to my sister’s weight loss?	"This happened in March, but it’s still a sticking point in my family. My sister (15F) is morbidly obese. Shes been trying to lose weight for the past year or so, but she never sticks to an excersise routine and she eats way more calories than she needs. 

In February, she got a really bad case of influenza, and it took her about a month to recover. She spent some time in the hospital, and she ended up losing more then 20 pounds. 

I went to visit my family in March (I’m in college) and I complemented her weight loss. She told me it was related to the flu; and I told her to keep up the momentum. I also told her that maybe her illness was a blessing in this guise, because it caused her to lose weight.

bvqt0i	2019-06-01 23:03:43	bifijohol	AITA for not calling my father at all?	"My father and I have always had a strained relationship. He was pretty much absent throughout my entire childhood and left when I was about 15, and the way he left was pretty fugly. Basically, we found out he'd been leading a secret life behind my and my mother's backs. It culminated in me going home from school, seeing him walking on the other side of the street with a woman, saying hello to him, and him completely ignoring me and walking past me. I was a teenager at the time and man, that shit stung hard.

After he left, however, he supported me financially for my first 6 months of college (until I got a part-time job) and he's sort of remained in my life. By that I mean that every 2 weeks he calls me and we have a 5 minute conversation where he asks if everything is okay, I tell him it's okay, he tells me to take care of my mother and hangs up. I have tried on several occasions to have more meaningful talks with him but he always shut me down and ended the conversations quite fast. To be honest, I never really had a problem with that. I grew up without him, if he wants to talk, that's fine, if he doesn't, I could care less.

More recently, I've gotten a really good job after receiving my PhD (mentioning this because it's the only thing that changed) and my father has suddenly been asking me to ""call him sometimes"". He's also been trying to extend our fortnightly 5-minute conversations, by sharing his political views with me (I am deeply disinterested in politics) .

Last month I got a call from an angry father saying that he is always the one calling me, that I ""never call"", and he insists I should ""check up on him"" every now and then. I told him that's a tall order given all the shit that he's done and that at least I never pretended he doesn't exist when I saw him on the street. He said that I ""seem to be very angry"", and he'd call back when I'm calmer (I was calm). We resumed the normal routine and he never asked me to call him again.

I mentioned this to my mom today and she said I'm an asshole for not calling him, because if it were not for his help over those 6 months, I would not have been able to go to college. She sad that I, in fact, owe my whole situation to him, and therefore I should call him. This is more or less true, as his help allowed me to attend an excellent college, which I would never have been able to afford otherwise. Throughout those 6 months, about half his salary was sent to me. At one point I heard his mistress/other wife also got a job, to better support themselves while helping me. It seems indeed that it was a big push for my success.

&#x200B;

However, it still seems weird how I now have this emotional ""debt"" of caring about a man that put me and my mum through a lot of pain, just because of this financial contribution. If he was in financial trouble, for instance, I would do my best to help him out, but this is different. So, reddit, AITA here?

bvqsnv	2019-06-01 23:02:44		AITA for cancelling a first date ?	"This happened last week, but it’s still fresh on my mind. For context, I’m a 23 year old woman. 

So I met someone who seemed like a cool person on a dating app one evening. We exchanged numbers and texted all day the following day. At one point during that following day, I asked them to get a drink in 3 days time .  They enthusiastically agreed, we made plans. 

The next day, we texted a bit but I thought about it and realized I didn’t really want to go on the date. I felt bad, but texted to cancel, hoping that giving them almost 2 days notice was a nicer thing to do then ghosting or cancelling five min before. I tried to be polite with cancelling and taking the approach of “its not you, I’m just really not in the right headspace to date  right now” (honestly true). 

They got extremely upset and hurt and offended. They sent me messages about how they thought I was different, about how they had trusted me and I screwed  them, and about how this was reinforcing their life view that they were undateable. I tried to apologize and they told me about a bunch of personal issues they were going through and stated that I just added a whole ton of shit to their life. It was a lot of self deprecation about how this always happens. They stated that they rearranged plans and cancelled things to meet me. Basically, they were extremely shocked and angry by this cancelled date. 

This left me feeling terrible. Should I have just gone on the date, even though I knew things probably weren’t going anywhere with this person ? I don’t have a lot of dating experience- is cancelling the date when you asked the person out considered extremely rude ?I know it wasn’t the nicest to ask them out and cancel, but a couple things about them had given me cold feet, also I would have had to travel like an hour to get to the date.

We both know a lot about cars and have a lot of tattoos, we have a lot more in common beyond that too. 

We went outside to smoke a cigarette and he asked when the next time he'd see me would be. I said I wasn't sure.

He friended me on Facebook after the party and messaged me, complimenting my chest. (They're pretty big.) I said thank you, and he said he would offer me ""support"" if I ever asked.

I'm really flattered, and he seems really nice. But Mary doesn't have a good relationship with him because he wasn't a good father when she was a child. One of my other friends told me I'm an asshole for even thinking about it.

In these parts, there are carnivals all over the state that take place on the first weekend of June. It's been like that since I was born. I'm going to assign the niece I made reference to in the title a pseudonym. It will be Michelle.

Anyway, my brother and his wife were busy and I've been to this carnival before. I was there with the intent of basically supervising my other niece while she goes on the rides.

Now, you should know that this particular carnival was about a quarter mile from my brother's house. It's not a very long walk.

Last year, Michelle had a couple friends over to go to the carnival with. I remember that very well. I thought and still think that if she wanted to go, she could call up a few of her friends so she'd have someone to go with.

Fast forward

Before I continue with the story, I need to assign my other niece a pseudonym. I will call her Heather.

I walk into my brother's house with Heather and I see Michelle standing in the archway by the kitchen. ""YOU'RE IN TROUBLE!"" Michelle tells Heather. I looked over at Heather and she seemed very bewildered by this. ""YOU ARE IN SOOOO MUCH TROUBLE!"" Michelle says.

I chime in with ""Why are you so bent out of shape? We just went to (Carnival name withheld for privacy purposes)."" ""THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!"" Michelle says as she gets right in my face. She grumbles and walks away. I say ""Jeesh. It's just (Carnival name withheld for privacy purposes. Again.)"" ""WHAT?!"" She yells at me as she's walking back toward me. ""Don't raise your voice at me."" I say.

After that, I gave Heather a hug because she asked me to and I left.

From a certain angle, I think that you could see me as the asshole, but these past few months, I've done Michelle loads of favors. Driving her/Picking her up from school, driving her and Heather to their dance class, and buying food.

My sister-in-law thinks I'm the asshole, but Michelle literally came out of her, so it doesn't surprise that she would side with her daughter, but personally, I thought and still think that Michelle overreacted. If she wanted to go to the goddamn carnival, the only fucking thing she had to do was ask me ""Hey, what time are you guys going?"" She didn't do that, though.

I’m a 15 year old female and I own thongs because I do sports requiring me to wear spandex and feel self conscious having panty lines. I’ve discussed this with my mom before and she understood and let me order some with my own money for use when I work out.

A few days ago I was going through an area in my dad’s closet where he had told me to grab a shirt for him and in a box underneath a robe, I found a thong that I’ve been searching for for weeks.

I immediately went downstairs and brought it up with my dad. He insisted that he didn’t know how it got there and I eventually gave up. I went back upstairs into the box and found 4 more thongs and 2 lacy bras, 2 of the underwear and the bras being my mom. I had been missing the two other thongs for months and was honestly very excited to find them.

I once again confronted my dad and he admitted him hiding them because he didn’t think they were appropriate for me. When I told him that half of the underwear and both bras were my mom’s he said he didn’t think they were appropriate for her, either.

We argued for a bit about it because I didn’t think he should’ve taken it from me without telling me or my mom and should’ve instead had a conversation so I could explain myself. He was pissed that I invaded his privacy and that he had the right to do what he did.

(I can’t pick them up myself as I don’t have my license yet.) She then goes out to eat with said friend, and I ask her to pick up my stuff on the way back. She knows the optometrist I generally go to closes soon, so there was no miscommunication. She comes back without my stuff, and I ask why she didn’t get it.

""Don't raise your voice at me.""  I say.

After that, I gave Heather a hug because she asked me to and I left.

From a certain angle, I think that you could see me as the asshole, but these past few months, I've done Michelle loads of favors.  Driving her/Picking her up from school, driving her and Heather to their dance class, and buying food.

My sister-in-law thinks I'm the asshole, but Michelle literally came out of her, so it doesn't surprise that she would side with her daughter, but personally, I thought and still think that Michelle overreacted.  If she wanted to go to the goddamn carnival, the only fucking thing she had to do was ask me ""Hey, what time are you guys going?""  She didn't do that, though.  Excuse me for not being psychic, I guess.

What about it, folks?  Am I the asshole?"		1	0

bvqjxg	2019-06-01 22:38:27	Poppy_S	AITA for expecting my new employer to cut me some slack?	"I’m a substitute teacher who will soon have an open schedule as the end of the school year is nearing. Over the course of the past couple months, I have been applying to numerous different jobs for the summer; all different types, just anything that pays the bills. One company which I applied to told me at the interview that, if I was hired, there would be mandatory training sessions beginning near the end of May (the first of which would be for employees from all over my state, and an hour drive away) and they gave me the dates of those sessions.

I didn’t think it was super likely I would get the job, as I was told they had a ton of interviewees and I got the feeling my interview went pretty good, but not fantastic. Nevertheless, I kept my schedule on those days open just in case. It crept closer and closer towards those dates, and I’d heard nothing from the company either way (hired or not). The day of the first big training session came around, and I still had yet to hear from them. I assumed that they must not have hired me, as it seems like they’d be certain to have notified all their hirees.

I **could** have contacted them and verified for sure, but trusted they’d let people know by the day of the training if they’d hired; didn’t think I’d get the job anyways, and had a bunch of other jobs I had applied to and was busy applying to; can’t keep your attention on them all.

Just a day ago, I got a very stern, borderline angry email from an address I didn’t recognize, but soon figured out was the boss of the local branch of the company I applied to. He tells me that I missed my first two training sessions (both of which were six hours), haven’t turned in any of my important paperwork that was due, and is questioning me why. I was flabbergasted to get this email; for I had never even been notified I was hired by the company.

After some back-and-forth, I figured out that the lady who interviewed me copied my email down wrong and sent my acceptance email (which also contained all the paperwork I needed to do) to the wrong address. My employer acknowledged this, but still told me that I need to get all my paperwork turned in (there is a ton of it) **and** my 12 missed hours of training made up for in the window of just four days. Between subbing and school, there is hardly any way I can do this.

When I asked him to cut me some slack, he told me that he’s sorry about the lady’s mistake, but that I had a responsibility to check with the company when I didn’t receive any verification email and I didn’t do it. He’s been really firm that I need all my stuff in within four days, and I’m really starting to wonder if I want to work for this guy after all. I’m considering telling him that I won’t be able to take the job if I don’t get an extension.

bvqjia	2019-06-01 22:37:21	wiysa	AITA for being pissed at my bf for not understanding I'm tired?	"I (20f) work 9hs at work everyday and study 4hs at night at university 3 days a week (I live with my parents, my bf lives with his parents). Adding trips home/work/uni/home I'm 15/16hs out. This of course has an impact on my relationships with friends/family/bf since when the weekend comes I'm exhausted.

My bf (25m) is missing final exams and he's done. He doesn't need to go to uni, he studies for his exams at his house. He quit his job so he could focus on his exams. He never had to work full time and then go to uni since he finished while working part time.

A few days ago I went to his house after work. When I go there sometimes we talk and then sleep for a while until dinner time with his family, especially on days when I have migraines (I'm going to doctors on this because they incapacitate me and may last for weeks). He knows that when I have them, light, noise or rough movements hurt me and the best I can do is sleep.

When I got there, he knew I wasn't feeling well at all, but we wanted to see eachother and if we're going to nap, we might as well cuddle instead of napping alone.

I fell asleep, nothing out of the ordinary. But then he woke me up all of a sudden my pulling me towards him (the harsh movement makes my head hurt even more). I ignored it, we talked for a while and made out, but before he made a move to have sex or something I went back to cuddling and sleeping. He did this three other times until it was dinner time. We didn't fight or anything, but I was pissed AF.

He knows I have migraines, he knows what makes it hurt even more, he did it for the sake of having sex when I can't even do it on those days because the movement makes the headache even worse. Besides, he knows I'm exhausted and if I fall asleep it's because I really can't keep myself awake.

On his defence, I know he doesn't understand how much my headaches affect me other than what I tell him (being incapacitated by a headache could sound like overreacting if you don't experience it). And besides  I understand he might have wanted some attention instead of me just sleeping.

Today he met up with his friends and we hardly talked, and the last few days I have been replying to his text a bit dryly, since I'm still pissed he can't understand or respect the fact that I'm not feeling well and might not be in the mood for sex (similar situations have happened in the past and I one or two times I ended up having migraine-pain sex just so I could sleep later in peace without the nagging).



###EDIT: 

 Idk if made out is the correct word or if it implies a lot of hornyness and sexual something I'm skipping. English is not my first language. What I meant by it is a few kisses and caressing face, head, etc. in a sweet way, not a sexy one.

Also, please don't demonize my bf. It isn't like he forced himself on me, and I get it I should have communicated better my ""I'm feeling like absolute shit"" status to him. He isn't cruel, he has never shown any serious disrespect towards me. He can be oblivious and sometimes selfish but with no ill intent, and I guess this was one of those days where we both fucked up.


I guess we both were a bit TA about it in different ways.


###**TL;DR:**

 My boyfriend woke me up three times in a row to have sex on a day when I was both exhausted and with a really strong headache.

I understand I might be the asshole here, so please tell me AITA for being pissed that he woke me up because he wanted to have sex?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvqjcc	2019-06-01 22:36:55	KingMoneystuff	AITA for getting mad at my mother for making me take too many photos	"I recently graduated from high school, but for a few weeks, before I graduated, my mother has been making me take photos everywhere. I understand that she wants these photos so she can look back on these in the future, but it got to the point where she wanted me to stand outside my school to take a photo when I was going to be late for school that morning if I didn't get into the building. It's not just when no one is around, she makes me take photos when I'm around my friends at school at the end of the day, which I find a bit embarrassing.   


The worst part of all of this is I hate taking photos, so when she forces me to smile in the photos, my smile just turns into this look of distaste. I snapped at her the other day because we were driving down our driveway and she stops the car and makes me get out to take a photo next to one of the trees, even though I took the same photo a few days before, but she said that my jacket wasn't on the right way in the previous one.

bvqj7d	2019-06-01 22:36:34	AITA_throwaway_19_	AITA for not giving my parents money?	"My mother was convicted of a white collar crime years ago and owes the U.S. government a substantial amount of money (neighborhood of $1.3M). She has now owed this money for several years. My parents have property worth around $1.2M-$1.6M. As far as I know, that's all their assets. She does not work (she spent time in prison) and he makes mid/high 5-figures.

&#x200B;

My sister and I are in our late 20s. We both went to college and have not received money from them since we were 18 because of what happened, save for a few hundred here and there. We both have been very successfully professionally (think \~$150k).

&#x200B;

A few years ago, my sister and I received letters that we were named as two of the main beneficiaries on my mom's uncle's estate. When we received the notice, we shared it with our parents. We were honestly not close to our great uncle/communicated with him sparingly during holidays/birthdays. My mother was very close with him growing up, and had continued contact with him. At the time of his death, he knew that my mom was in trouble, but the full extent/amount was not yet figured out.

&#x200B;

My mother now claims that she told my uncle to leave everything to us so that we could help her out. I have no way to verify this and she initially acted surprised, but she has also taken a lie detector test that indicates that she did tell him to leave everything to us so that we could help.

&#x200B;

At the start, we were open with them about what was happening, but their tone in conversations shifted over time, in our opinion, to indicate that they saw themselves more and more entitled to the money. We never came to an agreement on the extent that we would help them, because we were so far off (we gave them very broad assurances like ""we'll help when we can"" as the estate was being worked out, while they made it clear that they thought we were morally obligated to pay the debt outright if we could). By the time that it did close completely \~1 year ago, we already had had several blowup arguments. Our willingness right before the estate closed was probably to give them a monthly stipend but to ask them to sell most of their assets. After it closed, we had a few more VERY serious arguments. As it stands now, I have no immediate plans to help them at all or be in contact with them in any meaningful way (I can go into the reasoning for that specific thing in more detail if needed, but we've had some VERY bad arguments). The proceeds of the estate were in the same ballpark of $1MM EACH for my sister and me.

&#x200B;

AWTAs for keeping 100% of what we received, given that there is some truth to the statement that he would have liked some of the money to go to her, and that the lie detector test indicates that she did have some conversation with him, especially with the additional fact that we are both very well off independently? We have paid off student loans, etc., and have invested some of it, but we also both live within the means of what our own salaries would afford."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bvqh8c	2019-06-01 22:31:07	xMistful	AITA for wanting grandma to die?	"A few hours ago I made a post here, and I thought y not tell the whole story? 
So bare with me, it's a long story
I lived with my gran since I was born, and she was a bit strict, just the usual. Since my dad died, she developed the feeling that she had to take his place as a parent, I guess

As the years passed, she became more and more toxic and controlling, over every aspect of my life

She always had high expectations for me, so she wanted me to be a doctor. I wasn't sure at the time, so I kinda went with the flow. I had to choose a course when I got to high school, so I chose the health related one. Months went by, and I started realizing that most of my classes were extremely boring. I could change to another course, but I was too afraid of my gran's reaction. She absolutely despises tech bcs my uncle followed that path, and she wanted him to be a doctor

My motivation went downhill, and my grades too. But I had hope that it'd get better so I started lying to my gran about my grades, to keep her satisfied

I know it was a bad thing to do, and it wouldn't end well (it didn't). To make things worse, I'm not allowed to use my phone/tv/computer since high school started. She won't let me watch my favorite shows bcs 'they're too violent'. I'm also not allowed to go out with anyone. I mean, according to my grandma, I am allowed, but then she proceeds to tell me y I shouldn't go, in a manipulative tone ' U should be studying' 'You have time for that when u get older' ' You shouldn't waste time on that ' etc
She says I look and act like a boy, just bcs I like cars video games football, or just movies
She treats me like garbage, but she doesn't acknowledge that, to her it's for my own good
So, when high school ended,my grades were okayish, except maths, and I didn't have the balls to tell her that I wouldn't get to college. So I planned my escape

Packed everything in a week. Everything planned: a place to stay, enough money for a couple of months, and a place to work at. At this point I was so tired of everything, that I didn't care about anything else

So I booked my trip, and went for it. After hours of people trying to contact me, for some reason I ended up answering to my aunt,  she convinced me to tell her where I was. Initially she didn't believe I was +250km away, bt ended up going after me, I'll always be grateful for that

I stayed at her house for 2 days, and ended up going back home, hoping that things would get better. And boy was I wrong

I've been focusing on getting my maths grades up, and it's been a challenge. It's exactly the same shit as last year. My aunt tried to tell her that she needs to let me fly a bit, let me take responsibility for things, and she always says Sure, but ends up doing the same. I'm close to a mental breakdown, and again, no one seems to care. Small things keep stacking up.

A little background. My dad was in and out of Jail my whole life and when I was 12 he went to jail for good until I was about 20. He also would regularly physically abuse my mother. He was never there for me and I still hold a lot of resentment towards him. He recently tried to reach out to me but I've shut him down and I have no interest in having a relationship with him anymore because I have a perfect hated for him and all he put me through.

My older sister has made amends with him and they have a pretty good relationship now. I still see him at some family get togethers and birthday parties. 

When my daughter is born I know he will attempt to hold her and play with her but I don't think I'll allow that. The way I see it, he hasn't earned the right to know his grand kids.

I know I don't owe him anything but my concern is for the well being of my daughter. Does she have a right to know her grandfather? Will I be doing her a disservice by not allowing her to have a relationship with her grandfather?

For context: 

(My family is close to being Upper Middle Class (American))

This is supposed to be a graduation ""gift""

I say ""gift"" for two reasons.

One: I'm not really being gifted a car, so much as buying one off them for a lower price than it's worth (3,000 of the 5,000 value). Now I have no problem with paying, I think it can help me feel that I've earned the car, along with helping my parents with a down payment.

Two: Even though this is a ""gift"", I feel very much like it is not. My parents are telling me I'm being ungrateful because between school (which just ended) preparing for a huge party (which yes, was mine, but still took a lot out of me) and work (I've been pulling more shifts than usual) I haven't managed to quote ""do anything big to return the favor"". Now. I understand that I should be grateful. Write a card. Do something nice. When I have time. But they are acting like I've been a mega douche who's had all the free time in the world and has been doing nothing with it. Further, they are continuously telling me they wouldn't be getting a new car if I weren't taking the old one away, and that they are now adding $100's monthly that they didn't have before.

I'm seriously considering turning down their gift and instead buying something in my price range. AITA and is this a good idea?

bvqf3c	2019-06-01 22:25:17	cocodoor	"AITA for wanting my SO to be angrier with our ""presumed"" best friend?"	"Short: AITA for being upset with my SO for him not being angry with our 'best friend' for pretending to be friends with me for months so she wouldn't lose him.

&#x200B;

First, some backstory. My SO and I share a best friend… or so I thought. Ever since she found out we were together, the ""friend"" has been pushing me away and treating me like only an extension of my SO. In the past few months, I have put enormous amounts of work into this friendship to make it work, not understanding why things wouldn't improve.... until it all came to a climax this morning.

In the past few months, X has been pushing me away and stepping in my relationship in weird and disrespectful ways to both me and my SO. Slowly, we've gotten a little more distant, but we'd still act normal and as though our friendship was simply going through a rough patch. In a discussion this morning I have come to find out (or rather finally realize) that X has been letting me do all the work for the friendship and put no effort in as a way to please my SO.

In short, she's been using me as a punching bag for all the group dynamic issues and pretending to care about me for the selfish reason of wanting to keep her friendship with my SO intact. In the past months she has been mean and cruel to me, and this morning it all came to light. Since finding out about SO and I, X has refused to see me as an individual, but rather only considered me a ""+1"" to me SO. Right after that argument, in a petty attempt to AGAIN stir trouble in my relationship because I asked if she still stood by that narrative, X went to SO to say that ""they HAD to cancel their plans today"" and to ""take it up with your girlfriend"".I'm very hurt that she's showing such disrespect for me and my SO, moreso because he doesn't seem to see how what she's done has hurt our relationship.

I explained it all to SO, and he seems kind of unfazed by it. Worse, he isn't angry with her for how she's been treating me in the past months. He said he agrees I deserved better from her but other than that basically nothing. He told me he' had stopped trying to make her understand how she'd hurt me for a few months already, but that he would keep talking to her as he would usually do when issues come up. I haven't asked him to fight with her or stopped being friends with her, simply to talk to her. I don't even resent him being friends with X, I just think it's unfair of him not to address it with her. His reaction comes across as him not willing to stand up for me in front of his best friend, which makes me feel very vulnerable.

I feel betrayed that he doesn't see why I'm upset he's not angrier with X. I told him that I don't understand why he wouldn't be livid with her for treating the person he loves like they're a piece of garbage. Because of that, we got into a fight later today. I tried to explain to him why I don't understand why he wouldn't be furious with X but he says he doesn't see it at all and that I can't force him to be. I don't see why he wouldn't be angrier with her and he seems oblivious to why that's hurt me.  AITA for wanting him to be angrier than he is?

&#x200B;

Edit 1: he friend (X) had told me, before SO and I were dating, that he and I were spending too much time together and that it was unhealthy for both of us. I told her it was unfair and untrue that I was spending all my time with him, and that her painting me that way was hypocritical given that she did the same.Since then, she's come to her senses and hasn't made that comment, but knowing her friend circle was very concentred on my SO and to call her out if I found that she was being a hypocrite for giving me shit for something she does.

She and my SO sed to sleep together, about a year ago. At the time she swore she had no romantic feelings for him and was simply ""uncomfortable"" with us being together. She's never been able to explain what made her so uncomfortable about us being a couple. For months we hid our relationship from her, fearing she would be upset to find out. She had very big emotional reactions and would get involved between us to convince us neither of us were ready for a relationship. In the early beginnings, X would ask us to not talk about one another, not even text each other in her presence, and basically asked us to hide from her ""because she was uncomfortable"". That has caused multiple group fights, especially that she could completely shut me down but would allow me SO to have discussions pertaining to us with her. Even worse, any issue she had with me, she would tell my SO instead and expect him to address it with me.

EDIT 2: Overall I'm deeply hurt at her pretending to be my friend for months, even though I had brought up to her multiple times that I felt as though I was the only one working to make our friendship work. This morning she told me she was giving up on being my friend and was ""tired of working"" which was an enormous lie."	Not enough info	0	0
bvqevb	2019-06-01 22:24:38		AITA for angrily texting a girl after waiting over 24 hours for a reply?	"I (20M) have been seeing a girl (20F) recently and we've hooked up a few times. The second time went well and after that I felt things started to go up a notch.

Beforehand she had cancelled on me once and took a while to text me, sometimes I would be waiting more than 24 hours. This irritated me slightly, but I could deal with it. She said it was a particularly busy time for her and she was finding it difficult to find time to see me. I accepted this and didn't get angry. However, the next time we met up I mentioned that her cancelling last minute did irritate me slightly and she took it well. 

After this, things started to improve, and she texted me a lot more frequently. The texts were often flirty as well. I ended up seeing her again and we hooked up.

We're both students and after this we both had to go  home as it was the end of term. There is an opportunity where I might see her again next week, so I messaged her to make sure she was around. I waited almost two days for a reply and when I got none, I sent her  text saying over 24 hours is a bit too long for me to be waiting for a reply. 

After another day, she finally replied, saying she is around next week. She also said she replies when she is able to, but if she doesn't, it's because she hasn't had the time.

On the one hand I feel like I was an asshole for sending her the angry message, but on the other hand, I find it a bit weird that she can't find five minutes in a day to reply to my texts.

I give birth to my son Andy in 2001, Bob was the father but due to medicals issues my family took me and Andy with them. That was it for our relationship.

After about 12 weeks I landed a sales rep position. In comes John, asked me out for weeks. John met Andy when he turned 8 months.

We had about 2-3 great/happy years after, the last 8 years were hell. He turned to be  something else.

I give birth to our girl Elly about 2 1/2 years into relationship; Andy was 3. 

I stay for 5 years, then I left with kids. Let me explain, he wasn’t a bad dad at first. John was great with Andy, even started calling him dad.

Unfortunately John was not a good dad to Elly, he still isn’t and Andy saw this and still does.

Through the years the relationship between John and Andy deteriorated; I found after taking my kids to therapy the way he used to treat them when he was alone with them. I talk to him about extensively but he always says the kids are too sensible, they don't understand him. 

I decided to keep them full time, for the last 5 years John can visit, take them out but do not spend the night with him. Last 2-3 years only Elly goes out with him if she wants to, Andy just excuses himself.

Last year Elly had her Middle School graduation, I made the mistake to invite Jonn and his mom Sally. He was civil until the point the ceremony ended and we went to eat, was all grabby hands, talking nonsense, even pinch my butt. I left and asked Elly to call me to pick her up upfront after, I haven’t seen him since.

So Andy is graduating from high school next week (Jhon never did, he drop out on 11th). Andy has 4 tickets, he decided Me, Elly, my boyfriend Brian and Grandpa Rich (Jhon’s stepdad) can come. Has no intention to invite John. 

Andy got an extra ticket, decided to invite grandma cause of grandpa Rich. To explain, Sally lost her son DJ when he was 14; John was 11 when this happened, from that point she gave him everything but also make him who he is now. and has this deep sense to giove anythig he wants.

I was about to give them tickets for next week, Sally then says she will give her ticket to John, he raise Andy when he didn’t have to. This was started by Rich (I know he can’t stand him so I’m lost). I advise them I will think about it but didn’t give their tickets.

Now Sally called me telling me John is already pissed so she will give him her ticket and I need talk to Andy about it and made him understand what's right. Thinking of not inviting Sally to avoid issues.

EDIT, I'm very sorry if I sound catty or gave attitude to anyone. On 12-14 hour shifts the last couple of days, working throughout the weekend and the text / calls haven't stop so running on fumes.

bvqbmc	2019-06-01 22:16:16	tyan-_-	AITA for wanting to go to my best friends wedding?	"So a couple years ago I was about 17 and I was spending alot of time with my best friend (let's call him Josh) and his girlfriend (let's call her Sarah), about 2-3 months over the summer (I was recently single at the time and had nothing better to do). We would always be at his girls house, smoking weed and playing videogames, the usual. While we would be there, Sarah's mom would like to hang with us and talk since she wouldn't go to work until late. Eventually I start flirting with Sarah's mom in a joking way, and she started flirting back. Fast forward a few weeks and she's sending me nudes and telling me she wants to have sex (I'm still underage)
My mind is blown and I honestly can't believe it, but of course being the hormone charged and emotionally damaged person I was at the time I go for it.  It only happened once and the guilt got to me so I had to cut it off. 
Fast forward and I'm in a new relationship with a childhood friend, we've been together about a year and she literally knows everything about my life including me and Sarah's mom. 
During our relationship my girlfriend had a depressive episode and went to the mental hospital for about a week, and during this I went to Sarah's house one night to just talk with my only real friends at the time because I was going thru so much being the only one supporting my girlfriend at all and she damn near killed herself. 
My girlfriend found out about me being in the same house as Sarah's mom even tho I never even saw her there, I was in the basement the whole time where Josh and Sarah lived at the time. 
Now my girlfriend is completely denying me to going to the wedding because of that incident and she doesn't want to be in the same room as Sarah's mom for fear of attacking her. She feels even seeing her will ruin our entire trip and wedding, let alone if she attempts to speak to me. 
I don't think this is fair at all, Josh and I have been friends for years and he's also distant cousins/friends with my girlfriend. 
My girlfriend says I'm adding instability to our relationship doing this.

bvqbbh	2019-06-01 22:15:26	fulltimesunshine	AITA for not allowing my daughter to see her grandfather?	"So basically my boyfriends dad is not a good person. When my boyfriend was a child, his dad would physically and emotionally abuse him, his siblings and his mother on a regular basis. My boyfriend also told me about how he murdered some of the cats they had growing up and would physically abuse the other pets that they had as well. Needless to say, I was disgusted to hear this. 

&#x200B;

For reference, my daughter is 2 years old. I was never previously worried about her having to be around his dad because he lived quite far away. However, a couple months ago, he moved about 20 minutes away from where we are and is wanting to see her. 

&#x200B;

This has been causing a lot of fights between my boyfriend and I. He thinks that since the abuse happened roughly 7 years ago, I shouldn't be worried about it because it has been so long and he thinks that his dad has changed and regrets the things that he has done. 

&#x200B;

I personally don't think that he regrets any of it or has changed at all, unfortunately it would be hard to prove or disprove a this point. But even if he did, I don't know if these things are forgivable and my gut feeling is that I can't trust him with my daughter. 

&#x200B;

Because my boyfriend and I can't come to an agreement, he's just been making excuses to his dad about why he can't see his granddaughter. I am tired of this and just want to tell his dad straight up that he can't see her because of the things that happened in the past. I just don't know if I'm in the right or wrong?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I grew up with unknown learning disabilities and ADHD. For years my parents would keep telling me I’m not applying myself, I’m being lazy, being a waster in life, telling me I’m blowing all my opportunities et al.

So after complaining to my parents for a good five years that they weren’t listening (20 now, where we live we don’t really move out till after college since it’s in our major cities normally). I had to go out of my way to try deal with it myself, as they refused initially to pay for let me see one at all if they where paying.

bvq8xe	2019-06-01 22:09:17	ThrowawayAsshole1492	AITA for ignoring my dad?	"My dad is constantly calling and texting my brothers and me and eventually sent a letter saying he is coming back to our city. He and my mom divorced some years ago and he moved across the country to marry the woman he cheated on her with.

Throughout my childhood he was emotionally abusive, would frequently gaslight us about our experiences, and have temper outbursts that were terrifying. We did everything we could to not upset him and were much happier when he was out of the house. We learned later on that he cheated on my mom from the time we were small children.

After college, I clearly did not want to go back home and planned to move in with my fiancee. He threw a fit and threw my belongings that were still in the house out on the lawn, sent threatening and incredibly mean texts to me, and threatened my mom and brothers if they were to attend my graduation or wedding. I barely contacted him and only did infrequently at my mom's urging.  A few years after my wedding when my brother got married, he made a speech and mentioned how much of an asshole my husband was for living with me prior to marriage and not ""asking his permission for my hand"".

Things calmed down for a bit and my brother had 2 children. He would occasionally come visit from out of state but ended up having one of his outbursts in front of the children. My mom and brothers cut contact in totality at this point and I would only answer texts to avoid my dad's drama. They continued to receive messages even some threatening grandparents rights.

He discovered I was pregnant and told me that he should be the first to see the baby. When I refused he said he should have aborted me and that I should also abort my baby.  I texted him that I was done and had been trying to be kind towards him but I was over it and would no longer contact him.

After, he would text me saying he was diagnosed with cancer and about his treatment and prognosis. It was incredibly detailed and I eventually learned incredibly fake. He then began texting about harming himself. I never responded to any of his messages.

I went to the local police and we contacted the police near him for a wellness check. I was told he ""flipped out"" and started screaming about me but did not text after that.

Now that he is coming here I am afraid to see him. I have continued to ignore him and have made preparations at my home in case he turns up (security cameras, etc).  He has left a few messages crying and saying how he just wants to work things out and have a relationship.

bvq8ta	2019-06-01 22:08:58	DisassociationMan	AITA for trying to get my sister kicked out?	"My house consists of my Mom, my disabled sister, me (20) and my sister (24) with her 1 year old son. I'm the only one working right now, and I'm trying to save up to move out with my fiancee, but after my base rent of 200 a month plus all the extra I  give to help cover bills, I basically have a coin jar of savings. My  fiancee can't move in with us because we have dogs and she has 2 cats,  but my goal is to live with her by any means necessary.

On  to my sister. She would sneak her baby daddy (abusive asshole) into the house after Mom told him he wasn't welcome, up until the baby was 6 months old. Hasn't paid rent since she last worked,  when she was 3 months pregnant. Doesn't do chores, half the time she won't even clean up after her own kid.

Forward to today. I went to talk to my Mom to find her in tears. Her bank card was missing. Then she goes on to her account to find 60$ missing, from a gas station, drug store, and a liquor store. My sister stole the bank card and lied when asked about it. Since this is the dad's weekend, she's spending the weekend over at a guy's house with the card. Hasn't answered Mom's calls since she initially asked about it.

Mom  is heartbroken, but I am furious. My Mom's the type of woman that would  give her last penny to someone who needs it more than her, and to see  this happen to her after everything she's done for my sister, living  rent free to buying her son new clothes just yesterday, it sickens me. 60$ may not sound like much to some, but to this family it's a massive blow.

If she reports it as stolen, the  bank will review cameras and my sister will get  prosecuted. This would leave custody of  her son with her father, which we don't want. I again told her to  kick my sister out, and she once again didn't want to do that to her  grandson.

So, I gave her an offer. My fiancee is wonderful with kids, and the dogs never go in the basement, making it the perfect place for us to keep the cats. I told  her if she sued for custody of my nephew and kicked my sister out, I would give  her my entire savings as well as the rest of my paycheck each month so  she can truly catch up on bills. My fiancee would also pledge her  disability each month to help, watch the kid, and do chores.

My  goal here isn't to take my sisters kid. I don't want to do that, I know  she loves her son, but she should love her son enough not to fuck over  the woman that puts a roof over his head and food in his stomach. She  could take her son at any point she felt ready to take care of him,  whether staying with a friend, a boyfriend, or getting a job and her  shit together. But I truly feel like my Mom wants to just let this go because she has a kid, and I hate to see it happen. My opinion? Unless we take drastic measures, she won't learn a damn thing.

So, AITA?

I always fall asleep totally on my side but somehow I always end up in the middle, which bothers him. He says it so often, every evening and every morning. Mostly always in a jokely manner, and I always just half told him the same I told him just now:

We just got to bed after watching the CF finale and he was saying again about how last night I was in the middle. I started saying a little more serious (mood immidiately ruined, i told him this that he knows it ruins my mood but it just did immensely this time) about how i don’t know what to do bc I don’t notice it and he can just wake me up and that im sorry. I feel really guilty about it and ive said it multiple times over a long time. He works a lot and i want him to sleep well. I also said how now im the total bitch who ruined the mood and everything, which also sucks. But im kinda sick of saying sorry and feeling crappy when i dont know how to help it if he doesn’t shove me or wakes me up when i don’t realize it bc I’m sleeping!!!

 I’ve said so many times that I’m sorry and I don’t do it on purpose and that he can just shove me away or wake me up, I don’r mind. But then he doesn’t do this. So am i the asshole for getting upset? Any tips maybe too while we’re at it?"	No A-holes here	1	0

So, my girlfriend used to be a smoker, but we recently had a child (our first child) and she quit as soon as she found out which I was so proud of her for, I’ve never dealt with an addiction but I’ve always commended her for how she quit cold turkey as I can’t even begin to understand how difficult that is, and everytime she’s talked to me about having a craving I’ve done everything I can to support her and ensure her that she’s doing so well, however I have always been against smoking, I understand that it’s not my decision to make for her but I’ve always made it known that I personally don’t like smoking because of the medical problems it caused for my grandmother who passed not long ago. For the 9 months she was pregnant I told her that I’d really appreciate it if she tried to not smoke after the baby was born and she said she’s absolutely okay with that and happy to not be a smoker anymore anyway. Fast forward to 6 days after we had the baby, she tells me that she’s smoking again and says I’m being an asshole for being upset by that despite her knowing how much I didn’t want her to do that again, one of the main factors getting to me is the fact she says she’s changed her whole life and I haven’t when that’s not true, I gave up a lot too when I found out about her pregnancy.

bvq3ks	2019-06-01 21:55:33	graybottle	AITA - I walked out of my (now) ex-girlfriends house last night after asking her about bigfoots flipflops.	"She has a kid, he is visiting for a few weeks. They were going swimming. I havent seen her in over a two weeks with minimal texting. 
  She says shes just busy and cant make time for me. Sure, I get it. So I dont text. 
  Anyway, after not speaking she texts me yesterday and says her son hasn't wanted to see anyone. But I could buy them dinner as she ran out if her savings she had for him in the first week of him being here. 
  I thought she just wanted to be fed, so I backed off. Someone else bought her a Pizza. 
  She invited me over after, I accepted. Thinking maybe it wasn't just cash she wanted. 
 I ended up playing table tennis with her son and after about 40 minutes, told her I was going to head home. 
  She was surprised, but the entire time she was on the phone texting someone while I basically babysat her son. 
  After that I saw a black pair of flip flops. The tags were still on them. Size 11-12 sitting next to a pink pair that were easily for an adult. They had designs on them. Finally there were a smaller set, in superman blue. I figured those must be the sons. The pink were hers, and the black pair were for... idk who. So I asked her about it  
  She immediately got mad and asked me, ""I can't have black flip flops?"" I said that it was valid to have them, but what would they be for since there was a pink pair that was more her style. 
 She then said she needed them for yard work. 
  I thought that might be tough, yard work in flip flops. But by then she had said she just wants to spend time with her son. 
  I did get upset at her dismissal.  I told her that our relationship is clearly a chore to her, judging from her posture.  
   I went to leave and she said I was crazy for asking about the flip flops. Called me Insane. So I looked her dead in the face and asked her if this is what she was going to stick with.. that I was Insane for asking if there was someone those flip flops belonged to and not believing she needed black size 12 flip flops for yard work. 
  I then left and she slammed the door and locked it. While I asked her this, her son ran in the room. 

I really like this girl, it sounds like she isnt interested. Or treats me like i don't matter. Am I an asshole for asking about another guy? 
  I mean, why keep me around? Why invite me over? Maybe she does need oversized flip flops for yard work and I am crazy.. idk. So.. there's that."	Not the A-hole	0	0

They have their own Facebook page, because I think it's a fun way to share the joy of chickens as pets and help teach people about chickens. I try and keep a positive and family friendly atmosphere on the page because come on, it's chickens.

A year or two ago, this dude started popping up on all my posts, saying things like ""mm tasty nuggets!"" or ""she'd look good in the oven"" and various other hilarious, insightful, and witty comments. At first, I responded politely but firmly, letting the guy know that 1. these are pets and 2. I'm vegetarian, so I wouldn't even consider eating them. Some of the people who have the page liked also chided him for being so rude.

(Note: my other family members do eat meat, but even they wouldn't eat our chickens, because they're pets.)

The guy stopped for a bit and then came back in full force. He'd post pictures of chickens at slaughter, roast chickens, even just pictures of nuggets in a box. He started sending them over Messenger (to the page's inbox), too. I deleted all his comments, told him I'd had enough, and blocked him from the page. Job done - or so I thought.

In early March, I rescued a pigeon who I'm keeping as an indoor pet. I set him up his own Facebook page too. Both pages are named similarly and I'm set as a visible admin of both. Everything was going swimmingly until about a week ago, when lo and behold, Nugget Man shows back up.

He comments on all my photos with pictures of butchered pigeons and roast squab. I go about deleting his comments and, just as I'm about to block him, he posts a very nasty comment threatening to kill and eat both my pigeon and my chickens. I've had it.

I go to his Facebook page and notice that he has a pet dog. I reply to the comment with a picture of his dog and caption it something ridiculous like ""mmmm tasty dog meat"". Nugget Man flips, starts asking what the fuck is wrong with me and calling me a r*tard, and threatens over Messenger to call the police. I reply ""do it!"", delete the page comments, and block him from both my pigeon's page and my personal page.

When I'm recounting this tale to family and friends, they start scolding me and asking how I'd feel if someone threatened to eat my pigeon/chickens/cats.  (I can honestly only wonder how I'd feel!) I'm now feeling like a bit of an arse so truthfully: AITA?"		1	0

Now he walked into me with quite some speed from the side. I didn‘t see him. I obviously apologized but then told he that he shouldn‘t walk that fast because not everyone can escape that fast when realizing that a blind guy is walking towards them.

He was super insulted and told me he is handicapped and it‘s my fault i didn‘t get out of his way. After some heated discussing i apologized again but told him i do not agree since it‘s also in his interest to be a little more cautious.

He told me i‘m an asshole and left. I don‘t think i am though...i feel i was right defending myself when confronted in such an awkward situation.

bvq2u2	2019-06-01 21:53:42	EarlyAssignment	AITA for telling my husband of 15 years that I never want to have sex again?	"My husband and I have been married for about 15 years, dating for much longer. He's my soulmate and I can't imagine being with anyone other than him, he feels the same way. I've never really enjoyed sex that much, but my husband has an incredibly high sex drive so we used to have sex every other day. I've had sex with many partners (upwards of 30) in both relationships and hookups and I've just never really enjoyed it. It's inevitable that you're going to ask, but yes they can make me orgasm, I just don't like orgasming with a partner versus orgasming with myself. It just doesn't feel good to me.

&#x200B;

There's something about sex that I just don't really like (please don't say I need therapy, it's insulting to think that everybody must LOVE sex. I've also been to therapy before and we've come to the conclusion that it's mostly just a preference). I also don't identify as asexual though, because I do get horny and love masturbating, but I find it more of a release if that makes sense? It's more of an intimate moment with myself. I can try and explain more in the comments if this doesn't really make sense, but it's more a nonsexual release and enjoyment of exploring my own body.

&#x200B;

As we've gotten older with kids we've stopped having sex as frequently, two to three times a month *at most.* He knows I've never been a huge fan of sex, but I've recently told him that I want to stop having sex. I find it more a chore and I don't really gain much pleasure from it. He was so hurt and upset saying that I'm going to trap him in a loveless and sexless marriage.

&#x200B;

I told him that if he really wanted to have sex with other people, he could have sex with other women, I just wouldn't wanna know about it. He was so upset and said that I was the only woman he wants to have sex with and that he could never imagine having sex with somebody else. A couple days ago he caught me mastubating (something I do once a day) and he was even more hurt. He said how come you get horny but you don't want to have sex with me? I tried explaining what I typed above but he got even more hurt. We really love each other and have an amazing relationship aside from this, but he thinks I'm an asshole for making an executive decision about our sex life and trapping him in a lifetime without sex. So AITA for having a preference?

&#x200B;

tl;dr have never really liked sex, decided I still want to masturbate but no longer have sex with my husband

&#x200B;

edit: everyone seems to think my husband is going to divorce me over this, we've discussed it and divorce isn't even something he's considering. Redactors are so quick to pull the divorce card  when in reality there are so many other aspects to a heathy relationship that can't be explain in 3000 characters. Our marriage is strong, supportive and loving in many other ways. I don't feel like we need sex to still love each other"	Asshole	0	0

I heard live jazz music playing and assumed some geezer had gotten together with his buddies to practice. I thought this was cute at the time. Earlier in the day around three neighbors had thrown a yard sale, so I was feeling like I lived in one of those TV neighborhoods at the time. My sister who had been home the whole time was annoyed, but I felt it was harmless. They're still going strong and it seems to be a full blown live concert. I just walked across the street and discovered it's going on in the backyard of this house that has been vacant for years. The old owner died or something when I was in middle school and I didn't know anyone had moved in.

The new neighbors didn't tell anyone they would be having a live band and I don't know when it's going to end. Like it's not even night yet. It's like 6 and since it's summer, they've got a whole lot of daylight left. I want to call the cops on them now because I'm tired of it. It's one thing to have speakers playing a CD. This is live music. They're giving monologues into the mic and shit. Should I just leave them alone for a little longer or am I justified if I call the cops?

bvq2f8	2019-06-01 21:52:29		AITA For Fighting Fire With Fire?	"Here’s a quick and basic rundown of what went on. 

Earlier this week I got into an argument with a friend on our big group chat with the rest of my friends. The argument was stupid and we both told each other to fuck off whilst calling the other dense and other shit for not understanding something for so long. This led my friend to post an incriminating video of me in the group chat with a whole bunch of other people present; specifically the video is old and has me doing something with my nipples whilst undressed and is a video that my friend promised and gave their word he would never show anyone let alone keep.

Well this led to my own retaliation, obviously being quite displeased with my recent inclusion in the SFW Fappening. So I just let a whole lot of people know about the shit he’s been talking about them behind their backs. I saw this as fair as he voided my trust and went against his word so why shouldn’t I compromise him just as much. So this did lead to him now having issues with certain people now.

After this, the issue escalated into an argument in front of all of our friends. After this I learnt that everyone was against me even though I did the same exact thing he did, yet I’m the only one who gets any blame or criticism. I can’t help feeling I’ve lost most of my friends over this and so, am I the asshole?

TL;DR: Friend voided my trust and exposed incriminating photos of me so I voided their trust by letting people know what shit he talked about behind their back."		1	0

bvq1ed	2019-06-01 21:49:52	born2drum	WIBTA if I didn’t pay rent for an apartment I didn’t move into?	"So basically, I signed onto the last couple months of a lease, but I haven’t moved in yet. I paid my security deposit, and rent for last month, because I expected to move in sooner. But things came up, and it doesn’t look like I’m going to move in at all.

I learned that my would-be roommate is behind on her water bill and has no hot water in the apartment. Also, she never got Wi-Fi installed. I go to school online, so having accessible Wi-Fi is important for me, and a reason why I haven’t moved in. 

WIBTA if I asked her to cover all of the rent for this last month of the lease? She was living in the apartment without a roommate for a while before I signed on, so I’m pretty sure she can afford it. And I’ve stepped foot in the apartment twice, and moved none of my things in. I feel like I shouldn’t pay for an apartment I haven’t used, but I understand that I made a commitment when I signed the lease. I chose not to use it after making that commitment. What do you all think?

Edit: just to be clear, I have paid the rent for the month I’ve been on the lease. My would-be roommate is a friend of mine, and I wouldn’t argue with her if she said I should pay my share. I’m only asking if I would be an asshole for asking her to pay all of it this month, and the lease expires the next month. I haven’t said anything to her about it yet."	Asshole	0	0

bvpxv6	2019-06-01 21:40:41	croooo000zers	AITA for not reaching out?	" I have a friend who is close to me, we've been buddies for about 4 years now. I'm pretty introverted and don't talk much, so she's one of the few friends I have. One of the reasons the two of us got along so well is cuz we weren’t reliant on texting each other every single day, mostly cuz we saw each other at work and had similar extracurricular classes. Lately, though (for the past 4-5 months) she hadn't been in touch AT ALL, meeting once in two months, not seeing my texts for a full month before responding, and not even shooting a little ""hey long time!” We're still in the same neighbourhood.

The last time i met her (in march), she rudely spoke about this friend of hers who had been guilt-tripping her over her lack of responses. She told me how she cut off all contact with him, and how she isn't in touch with anybody from our old friend circle. Fair enough, maybe the guy was being a dick about it, so I left it at that. But I then found out she was in constant touch with this questionable guy who cracks a lot of offensive jokes and has taken advantage of one of my friends' addiction to sell her stuff. I and some other people in our circle never liked that guy. The only reason my friend talks to him is because she has an unrequited crush on him (she has admitted this to me) and hasn't let this go even though she has a boyfriend.

That was the last straw for me. I figured if she could make time to talk for that guy everyday but not any of her actual friends, maybe I'm just putting effort into a friendship that's begun wilting. I stopped trying to initiate conversation, and one day she sensed something was wrong and asked me if we could meet on Monday (texts were on Saturday). I agreed, arranging an early day off work... only for her to go AWOL and not respond. I got really fed up at this point but I didn't confront her cuz I'm extremely non-confrontational. Around two weeks later though, I couldn't bear it and I snarkily sent ""It was great meeting you!"" to which she told me about an exam she had and how she'd missed two weeks of prep class for it, but then I was so pissed off I just sent ""Whatever"" and left it.

Five days later she told me that she has a stomach ulcer that might turn cancerous. She told me she hadn't spoken to anyone about it, how it's kept her busy for the past few months, but she kept implying I was an asshole for giving her the cold shoulder. I asked her why she didn't tell me before, to which she replied she didn't want to ""use it as an excuse"". I told her politely that while it sucked that she was going through that, I never KNEW she had something so serious going on in her life- literally, ZERO information at all, we never spoke about anything like this. As far as I knew, she was perfectly healthy- and that I actually felt more hurt that she felt she couldn't confide in me.

"Well, she always asks me to get rid of cockroaches/water-bugs in the house, and thinks they're gross. I kill them all the time, without telling her. But last night I zapped one, and left it for her to dispose off as a joke. I also joked that it was a female empowerment thing (tongue in cheek) and that if I do ""traditionally female"" tasks such as cleaning/cooking/dishes, she should do some ""traditionally male"" tasks like getting rid of bugs. Not the greatest joke in the world, but I was a bit drunk and thought it was really funny at the time.

&#x200B;

We're no strangers to practical jokes/pranks. She pulls pranks on me all the time. She's pretty mad at me for over 12 hrs now, and I can't tell if I did something wrong. 

&#x200B;

I asked her if this was because she is a vegan/against animal cruelty. She said yes. So I showed her literature that says insects do no feel pain like humans do (due to a lack of emotions, no well-developed nervous system etc), and explained that ""I'd never do that to a rodent. If we find a mouse in the house, it will die a quick, painless death at my hands. I do not enjoy torturing living things, but if these vermin species over-populate its a really bad thing for us humans, and for our higher-mammal pet species""

&#x200B;

Then it became a debate of whether we should kill vermin at all. She said I should have a ""capture and release"" policy towards all unwanted guests in the house, I disagreed. I grew up in a tropical climate with lots of insects that can spread diseases (mosquitoes, roaches, rodents), and have a no-mercy attitude towards them.

&#x200B;

I thought these were the right things to say, to express that I'm not an evil human, but this debate made her even more upset. I love her, she's such a gentle soul. But these debates drive me crazy.

EDIT

A - 18 year old son, graduating
B - biological dad
J - Raised A, my son
R - J's stepdad
S - J's mom
E - Our daughter, J and I.

I give birth to son A in 2001, B is the father but he hasn't been in his life.

After about 12 weeks after I landed a sales job. Here comes J, asked me out for weeks but I knew he had a girl. They broke up, he is 4 years my junior so it was no. He turned 20, keep insisting, flowers, calls, popping up when I was on my way to work. J met Andreu when he turned 8 months.
We had about 2-3 great/happy years after, the last 8 years were hell. He turned to be  something else.

I give birth to our girl E about 2 1/2 years into relationship; A was 3. I stay for 5 years, then I left with them. Let me explain, he wasn’t a bad dad at first. He was great with A, even started calling him dad.

Unfortunately J was not a good dad to E, he still isn’t and A saw this and still does.

Through the years the relationship between J and A deteriorated and found after taking my kids to therapy the way he used to treat them when he was alone with them. I always checked with them when they were with him, I talk to him about extensively but he always says the kids are too sensible, don't understand him. 

I decided to keep them full time, for the last 5 years J can visit, take them out but do not spend the night with him. Last 2-3 years only E goes out with him if she wants to, A just excuses himself.
Last year E had her Middle School graduation, I made the mistake to invite J also his mom S. He was civil until the point the ceremony ended and we went to eat, was all grabby hands, talking nonsense, even pinch my butt. I left and ask E to call me to pick her up upfront after, I haven’t seen him since and I really don’t want to plus my boyfriend B will be there this time.

So A is graduating from high school next week (J never graduated, he drop out on 11th). A has 4 tickets, he decided Me, E, my boyfriend B and Grandpa R (J’s stepdad) can come. Has no intention to invite J. 

A got an extra ticket and decided to invite grandma S cause grandpa R. To explain the situation more S lost her son DJ when he was 14; J was 11 when this happened, from that point she gave J everything but also make him who he is now.

I was about to give them tickets for next week, S tells me she will give her ticket to J as he should attend as he was there, raise A when he didn’t have to. This was started by R (I know he can’t stand him so I’m lost). I advise them I will think about it but didn’t give their tickets.

Now S called me telling me J is already pissed so she will give him her ticket and I need talk to A about it amd made him understand what's right. At this point I’m thinking about to maybe no invite S but I know R really wants her to go. 

*In context, it's my son graduation. Grandma (dad's mom) wants to give her son her ticket when he was not invited.

EDIT, I'm very sorry if I sound catty or gave attitude to anyone. On 12-14 hour shifts the last couple of days, working throughout the weekend and the text / calls haven't stop so running on fumes. 

AITA if I refuse to invite him?, I know he raised A but he is no longer his father by his own doing, it's his graduation and was not invited."	Asshole	0	0

"I met this girl at a bar, we immediately hit it off and she ended up asking me for my number, and giving me a kiss before we went our separate ways for the night. We began texting almost immediately, and it was very clear there was a very high level of mutual attraction.



We went on quite a few dates, never progressing more than just making out. I joked about being able to tell my parents next time I see them (they live out of state) that I had a girlfriend and she said that'd probably work.  Long story short, it was very clear we were both super into each other.  (But taking it slow. This takes course over a couple of months.)




Eventually she came over to my house for the first time, and we were enjoying ourselves and watching a movie. She goes to the bathroom at one point, and when she comes back she says she has something to tell me. She's been struggling with her sexuality for awhile (I was aware she was bisexual, so this wasn't shocking necessarily) and she had come to realize that she was fully gay. I forget the exact words, it was a month or so ago, but she said that while she's 100% into me romantically, she just knew that she'd never be fully happy with me.



It sucked. I was fine, we hung out for a few more hours and I called her an uber home. We haven't talked much since, as the last time she texted me I told her I needed space. She said okay and she hopes I'm well.



A few other important bits of information: I'm early thirties, she's mid 20s. We were ""dating"" (never officially a couple) for a couple of months. I'm not some sort of militant neckbeard complaining about the friend zone (at least I hope I'm not), I was just incredibly into this girl (and still really am) that I feel like it would be very difficult for me to remain just friends with her.

bvpqhe	2019-06-01 21:22:10	muchdude	WIBTA for leaving my job right now?	"To give a brief overview of the situation, I got a job in a different city right out of college and I haven't really enjoyed it here.  A couple of months ago, my boss came to me and wanted to send me to a 4 week training course.  The only issue is that the course costs roughly $25,000 with travel.  They wanted me to sign 3 year contract saying that I'd pay them back the pro-rated cost of the training if I decided to leave the company.

&#x200B;

I said, ""No thank you."" The risk:benefit ratio just wasn't there for me.  The training was very specific to my current role and it wouldn't really do anything for me outside of the company.  (Not to mention the fact that I was already looking for another job) They then came back and offered to give me a 1 year contract and I declined again.  Then I get called into upper management's office with my boss.  They basically started asking me if I was thinking about leaving the company and why.  I wasn't wanting to disclose the fact that I was job hunting, so I pretty much just lied to their faces.  I told them that I wasn't looking for a new job, but I just didn't feel comfortable with the contracts.  They decided to send me to the training without the contract.  I would have preferred not to do the training at all, but I felt kind of backed into a corner so I agreed.  They also requested that I tell them right away if I ever decide that I want to leave the company.

&#x200B;

While I was away at training, I get a call from my dream company saying that they want to setup an interview.  The position is in my hometown and is likely a SUBSTANTIAL raise.  I went through with the interview and now I'm waiting to hear back.  Would I be the asshole for leaving my job right now?

&#x200B;

The whole reason they have the contracts apparently, is that someone did the exact same thing that I'm about to do.  It was never really my intention to fuck them over, but if I end up getting an offer it would be a horrible career decision to not accept it.  I'm also somewhat worried they'll call to check references and my boss will tell them I fucked them over and give me a horrible review.  Then I end up not getting the dream job and I get fired on top of it.  I think it may be a gamble worth making though.  Am I the asshole here?

&#x200B;

bvpphx	2019-06-01 21:19:37	Creamy_Sans	WIBTA if I broke ties with an emotional friend?	"(TL;DR at the bottom)

My best friend decided to start a relationship with my other close friend. I told him it would be a bad idea because if they ever broke up, it would severely impact our group of friends. He went through with it anyways, and after a month he wanted out of the relationship because he found her too clingy. He decided to end it asap because he didn't want her to get too attached. After a month and a half, they broke up.

About the girl:
I've known her for a while and had dated her a few years ago (lasted about 3 months, broke up with her because she was pulling me away from my other friends). She seemed to be ok after about a week. She started dating guys constantly for short periods of time (average relationship time: 2 months). She gets very emotional after each breakup, but is usually fine after a week, then goes and finds someone new. She shows signs of being bipolar and depressed, but nothing has been confirmed.

About their relationship:
She was extremely clingy and got very attached in the first week. They would constantly stray away from the rest of the group and make out, leaving everyone else feeling awkward. When they were alone, she would start crying if he asked her to go home a bit early for whatever reason. He was not happy in this relationship, but she seemed very happy. When they broke up, she started bawling and rushed home. The next day we saw cuts on her arm.

Now:
Whenever we go out as a group she insists on coming with us, especially if my best friend is there. During most of the day she seems perfectly fine and happy. However, when it starts to get late, things change. She always wants me to comfort her and try to make her feel better since I've known her for a long time. My best friend just stands there and doesn't know what to do, and I feel bad for him. All she tells me is ""I miss him"" and ""I still love him"". My best friend has made it clear that he is not still interested in her.

She adds stress to the group whenever he's around, and there's nothing we can do to help. This has been going on for 5 weeks since the breakup, and I can't deal with it anymore. Me and my best friend agreed that we should break ties with her, even though it seems immoral (Just to clarify; she would still be hanging out with the rest of the group, but me and my best friend wouldn't be there when she is)

WIBTA if I break ties with her?

TL;DR
My best friend broke up with a girl I had known for a long time. He found her too clingy and wanted to break it off soon to avoid making things worse for both of them. She was severely impacted by this and constantly mentions how she still has feelings for him, even though my best friend told her he isn't interested anymore. She still hangs out with our group of friends but she always brings the mood down and starts crying. This has been going on for a few weeks now, and I can't take the stress of trying to cheer her up anymore."	No A-holes here	0	0

Neither remarried until recently when my dad married his girlfriend of five years. His new wife has a relative, Eve, who she’s really close to. She is 10 years younger than me and I would say that she treats her like a niece. 

At least once a month, my dad will update me about what Eve is doing. She has a good job, knows a bunch of famous people, and all that. The thing is that I don’t care. I’ve only met his wife a handful of times so I’m not close to her. I’ve only met Eve once and that was at their wedding. The only relation I have to his wife and Eve is by marriage. That’s great he has a new family he is proud of but considering I rarely see any of them, I don’t really care what Eve is doing.

Before anyone says I’m jealous of Eve, I am not. I just don’t want to hear the humblebragging of my dad about Eve and all the famous people she knows. It’s just not something I care about and I enjoy my life as it is without needing to hear about someone I don’t even know.

Few weeks before the event, we talk a bit about what we're going to do etc. She mentioned that her bf will join us (they started dating around the end of last year) I was a bit off bcs I knew that I won't get much time with her like every year but just said ok, we're already hanging out with her friends at the festival and i can't back out now

So came the day of the event. While we're getting ready her phone is buzzing off, i ask what's happening and she tells me it's her bf making sure she's awake. I was like he's coming now?

We joined him, in the beginning it was fine but as time goes they started to be more lovey dovey (i find those situations super awkward so i tend to avoid but here i couldn't do anything but just tag along behind) Anyway we ran into her sister ""Oli"", i thanked god and begged her to stay with us. From here, my friend kind of like forgot abt me and it seemed more like i'm Oli's friend. I got a moment to tell her this and she said she's sorry her bf is super clingy. She told him afterwards and i had a little fight with her bf and he told me like do i have a place to stay this night bcs i'm probably not going back to my friends house (my friends didnt say anything when he said this, probably bcs it sounded like a joke) The afternoon came and her friends joined us. Now I'm getting more at ease. One of friends (who doesnt really like bf) mentioned that she doesnt understand why Emy brought him when she knew that i was coming and specially for her, in her town. This made me understand why i felt upset. The night Emy popped ""I'm going to eat with my bf"" then she was gone and left me alone with her friends who told me they don't approve her behaviour, but in the meantime they understood she wanted to enjoy the festival with her bf and I. The festival is coming to an end, my phone is dying and she didnt come back yet. Her  friends told me that Emy's in her car and won't come back. I had to look for Oli with the help of her friends who didnt want to let me alone in this town (thank god)

In the end, I felt not welcomed at all. The days after I still felt hurt. Few days later she came to apologise bcs she talked with her friends who said it wasn't cool of her to act like that. Now idc anymore but i don't plan to go to the festival next year or any other year, i felt like i was too much. I told her this and she acted sad and like i was mean so AITA?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bvpndk	2019-06-01 21:14:08	throwawayatia1996	WIBTA for being annoyed at my partner for the way he worded a text?	"Short term lurker, first time poster, on mobile

So I’ve(22m) been dating a guy (22m) for about 3 months and it’s been agreed that even tho nothing’s official that we’re exclusive. Well last night he went out with a flat mate and text me to say he’d “pulled someone but told them he was seeing someone” (for anyone not familiar with the term it usually means you’ve met someone you’re mutually interested in and that can range from anywhere from meeting someone you like right up to taking them home). I played it cool until later on when I asked how far it had gone and he told me that the guys friend had come over to ask if he was single to which he’d replied “no I’m seeing someone”. I’ve accepted this but WIBTA for being upset with the way he worded the initial text even if nothing happened? I haven’t raised the issue with him but my friends agree I’m right to be upset over it?

Edit: I think I’m possibly gonna bring up how the wording made me feel but I do agree if nothing happened that I don’t need to be upset by that. It’s purely the way he worded it and left me wondering for a few hours until I asked more about it that’s upset me."	Asshole	0	0

I have a nephew who likes to get into my things, when i’m not in my room, at first he used to grab scissors and cut up my stuff but then escalated to him stealing things and hiding them, i would get mad but my mom would just tell me he’s a baby and doesn’t know better so I would just ignore it and get my stuff back/try to fix it. 

However recently he took something that was important to me, it might be silly but it’s an anime figure that my friend had given me, now this friend has passed away recently and i’m still dealing with the loss, so when i found out he lost it i became angry and yelled at him after i couldn’t find it.

I do admit that i shouldn’t have lost my temper at him, but i was so upset and it didn’t help that my mom was angry at me for getting upset over something so silly, because for her it was just an anime thing that friend gave me and it’s not something that’s memorable(?) of my friend. 

Everyone is saying that i’m an asshole for getting upset at a kid, but I had told him many many times before not to come into my room and take things but he would never take me seriously because my mom would just tell him to ignore me and that i have no say in what he does or how to raise him.

edit for some context: yes i can lock my door but it’s not that hard to unlock even he knows how, and i do hide my things in a little cabinet thing but he always knows how to find them.

for the things that i said/yelled, things like asking why was he in my room, where was the figure at, and that he needs to stop taking my things."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvpja7	2019-06-01 21:03:26		AITA for breaking up with my boyfriend because he waved at another woman?	"Lat weekend my boyfriend at dinner and were seated outside, along a busy street. As a car rolled by, he smiled and waved to a woman in the backseat in one of the cars. He told me she was an ex of one of his friends that he hated. Shortly after she texted him saying ""I still have you in my contact as 'asshole'."" He didn’t respond to her in front of me, but did later. He seemed to make it a point to not respond in front of me.

This part is important for the rest of the story: That same night my friend texted me “Are you with 'B' again?” And my boyfriend saw the text. He asked me why she sent that and I said “I don’t know, last she knew we broke up.” The next few days he kept asking me about it, asking why she texted me that, and when I told him that she didn’t respond when I asked why, he didn’t believe me. It was getting weird how many times he asked me. 

So, a few days after that, my boyfriend told me ""his friend's ex"" messaged him saying “If you want to change your contact name come over. Seemed like a first date.” He told me he didn’t respond but deleted the message so has no proof that he didn’t respond. I was annoyed he even told me, then didn’t even have the message to prove it. In my gut, I really just didn't believe his version of the events. In the past he has told me a woman messaged him x, he said y, and I found out it wasn’t true.

Then he said, “I thought maybe your friend and her knew each other and that’s why she asked you if we were together.” Him not telling me that until then made me think he did message her back and was scared I knew, and wanted to test the waters. Or that he wanted to message her back but wanted to make sure my friend doesn’t know her- which has happened in the past. 

I asked him what her name was and he refused to tell me. It was more of a question in passing but his refusal to tell me was weird. He said I would try to look her up on Instagram and he doesn’t want it to get back to his friend, who I don’t even know. He gave me a fake name and when I explained to him he would be mad if the tables were turned, he gave me her name which I don’t even know is true or not. I was on Instagram shortly after and he was like “Are you trying to find her?” and was laughing. I wasn’t.

Yesterday I confronted him about it, told I felt like he was being shady about the whole thing. He sent me a screenshot of him telling her he has a girlfriend *after* I confronted him in response to her saying ""Are you going to tell me?"" He for some reason had that message from her on Instagram, but no other message. The entire thing was so fucking sketchy and I kind of blew up on him, said it was over, and that ""now he can sleep with her if he wants."" To which he admitted that he already did.

I’m home from college and I was hanging out with my high school friends at a restaurant. In high school I was really shy and never stood up for myself and this one friend in particular used to always make snarky comments which I never said anything to. In college I got better friends and stopped being so shy. So at this restaurant I was eating my food (there were like 6 of us) this girl who we will call B said to me “at least you won’t throw up your food this time”. I had recently recovered from an eating disorder which B knew about, but not everyone we were hanging out with did. I decided I was sick of her always putting me down and I got up, dropped my plate on her, put money down, and left. I called her an asshole on the way out.

bvphwb	2019-06-01 21:00:06	gummery	AITA for not wanting to go to an engagement party and wedding?	"Ok AITA i need a judge

Relevant Information: 

I have met the best friend and her fiance a total of two times. For a couple of hours each. There has been no effort on either side to fix this as they live a few hours away. We are essentially strangers despite my gf and I dating for a year and a half.
 
The story:

My gf told me her bestie got engaged and that she was going to be Maid of Honor. I was excited for her knowing that she wanted this to happen and glad it came to be for her.  She then told me we'd been invited to the house warming and engagement party and she was okay with me not going, but i was warned I had to go to the wedding.  

I replied that I didn't want to go to the house/engagement party  as I barely know who these people are, and have little association with them let alone their actual network of friends and family. I also explained that while this could be used as an attempt to get to know them, that doing so when they have an entire house of families and friends it was super stupid  timing.  I'd get a few minutes of conversation, then be forced to walk around and attempt to mingle with strangers who i have no connection to.  

It didn't feel like an appropriate time for me to be there. (The gf would be there but mostly  acting as assistant host, catering to everyone and making sure things went smoothly as she's a very close friend, so i wouldn't be socializing around with her to introduce me around as she's busy. )

When she said that's okay  we still have the  wedding, I resisted again. I reminded her that she is the maid of honor, and I'm just her boyfriend. Not only will she be busy running errands and setting up for the wedding(which i have zero doubt I'd be roped into doing as well), but as part of the wedding party she's supposed to be with the best man for all of well...all of it. I don't have a spot in things aside from guest.

 She has to sit at the table with the wedding party and everything else during the reception, and yes we could dance after all the official first dance stuff is out of the way, but she still will be going around making sure the event goes off without a  hitch to even have time to do more than one or two dances. 

While the wedding is going on, ill be shuffled around to wherever for seating which inconveniences the bride and grooms plans, and yet again stuck with dozens of people i don't know. Same at the reception. 

Closing thoughts:

I feel like since i don't know the people it shouldn't be expected of me to come to these things even if i am dating the maid of honor.  

My SO is upset because I have no interest in going to either of these events. Her reasoning was that we'd have fun as a couple, I'd get to know the hosts better and she wanted an excuse to see me all dressed up and dance with me.

bvpgxq	2019-06-01 20:57:47	FindusMaximus	WIBTA if I asked back a self made gift from my (almost) ex even if she doesn't apprexiate it and might throw it away/destroy it?	"A few months before christmas my girlfriend had the idea of making each other stuffed animals for christmas. I thought it was a good idea and started to work a lot on it because I really cared a lot for her and didn't want to disappoint her. I didn't even know how to stitch and stuff but I still gave it a try and I think it turned out pretty well for my first stuffed animal.
When I visited her for christmas and gave her my present I saw that she not only did not do her part, she didn't gave me anything at all. This kinda hurt me.

Well that's OBVIOUSLY NOT the reason why I want to break up with her. I don't want to get into it that much but it's basically because she totally neglected me and doesn't really care for me anymore. The christmas thing is just one of many, much bigger signs.

Now If I break up with her I'm pretty sure she will throw away my gift. Why wouldn't she? It doesn't have any materialstic or useful value and it would only hurt her thinking about me.
The thing is, I think it would be a shame if she just threw it away like that because I worked quite hard on it. I kinda want to ask it back. And I know it's a really bad taste to regift a personal gift but...I just think someone else (my little cousin for example) would deserve and appreciate  it much more

It sounds really scummy I know but... does someone get me?

bvpfxi	2019-06-01 20:55:14	klong653	WIBTA for complaining to my foster dogs rescue about something another volunteer said to a potential adopter for my foster dog?	"Title might be a little confusing, and this is probably unimportant and petty but it’s bugging me. I just recently started fostering a rescue dog. This is my first foster dog ever,  and my first time working with this rescue (or any rescue, for that matter.) I’m a volunteer, so this is unpaid, not sure if that really matters or not. Today was the first adoption event that I took my foster dog to. He was recently vaccinated so this was the first event he could attend, and it was the first event I’ve ever attended as well. I had one family that was very interested in my foster dog, and they spent a lot of time playing with him and asking questions. I’m almost sure they’re going to end up being a great fit for him, but I’m not sure they’ll end up applying because one of the other volunteers (let’s call her B) at the event made me sound, in my opinion, like an absolute flake. I’ve never met B before, and don’t even know her name. 

Here’s what happened: after letting the family play with my foster for about 30 mins, they asked about how to apply for the dog. I took them over to our booth, where I asked B if it was better for them to do a paper application or apply online. This would be the first application I’d ever received for my foster dog. B said “it’s better to apply online because then we don’t have to manually enter the info from your application and it’s faster... and OP should contact you within 48 hours after you apply, or if she doesn’t you tell us and we will get on her.” She then repeated that last statement about 10 times. “If she doesn’t contact you within 48 hours, you tell us, and we’ll make sure she does.” Literally kept repeating that over and over until I finally said goodbye to the people and walked away, and I could STILL hear B repeating this over and over to this family until they eventually left. “Tell us if she doesn’t contact you.” “Seriously, tell us if she doesn’t contact you” 

Maybe I’m making a big deal about this, but it honestly made me feel like B didn’t trust I would contact these people right away if they applied, which I 100% would and have no idea why she would even say something like that so many times. I felt like it portrayed me as being flakey and irresponsible to the potential adopters, and now I’m afraid they aren’t going to apply because they think I won’t follow up and they’ll have to get someone to make me contact them. 

So my question is: WIBTA if I bring this up to someone in charge at my rescue? I obviously don’t want B to get in trouble as she is also just a volunteer, but I wouldn’t mind this being addressed because if B is consistently saying this to potential adopters it might be impacting whether or not people decide to apply for these dogs. I am a little bothered by how this statement made me look, but I’m more bothered by the fact that now these people may not apply for my foster dog and they could have possibly been his forever home."

We both grew up in the same neighbourhood and lived very similar lives. We have always been incredibly close and I actually refer to her as my sister because calling her my cousin just feels out of place. In our family, there are a lot of negative influences and I feel like like it's my duty to help her become the best person she could possibly be. I would take an hour out of my day and read the Harry Potter books with her every night and although I'm incredibly busy with school and work, I try my best to spend time with her whenever I'm available.

Our families have always gotten along well but my parents have never gotten along with her mom's family. In particular, there is a guy named John, who is her mom's brother, that they particularly don't get along with. I've always thought it was weird and recently they told me all about it. 

About a decade ago, my dad was back in his home country visiting family. He ended up going back to his hometown and brought John along with him. Late at night, as they were about to drive back home, they were attacked by a group of men. John was able to get away but my dad was nearly beaten to death. He was then rushed to the hospital and ended up surviving. Luckily, my dad was able to identify the men who attacked them and he also had John as a witness who could back up his claims. However, when my family asked John if he would testify, he refused and stated that he didn't want to be involved and possibly become a target in the future. 

Obviously, my parents weren't happy with his decision and later found out the true reasoning behind it. Years later, my father was told by someone from their hometown that those men had actually bribed John and his family to not testify against them. They paid them 200,000 rupees, which was a few thousand dollars. My father then confronted John's family with this and they confessed and apologized. 

After learning about all of this recently, I became incredibly furious. John and his family are also close with Katy's family. Although I love Katy, I can't just associate myself with people who associate themselves with my enemies. This might be a little hyperbolic but I hope you can understand where I'm coming from. I ended up giving her an ultimatum and asked her to either choose them or me. She said that she would have to think about it and she'll get back to me. Right at that moment, I blocked her number and decided that it was over. She knows the truth and how John and his family screwed my father but still wants to associate with them. If roles were reversed, I would have cut John off immediately and it just hurts that she wouldn't do the same. I know ultimatums suck but I just can't control how I feel about this situation."		1	0

bvpcas	2019-06-01 20:45:29		WIBTA for asking my gf to return her birthday gift to me and get me something else?	"(TL;DR at bottom)

I would like to preface this by saying that we are both teenagers and are both very broke, so anything over $100 is a huge purchase for us. 

Also, our birthdays are only two days apart, so we agreed to get each other gifts of similar value on the same day.

My (17m) girlfriend (17) always goes a few nautical miles overboard when getting birthday or Christmas gifts, which is very stressful for three reasons. For one, it creates a sense of competition that makes me feel like I need to spend the same amount, which I can never afford. Another problem is that she also can’t really afford the gifts she buys for me, and almost always ends up paying for them in multiple installments over a couple weeks. This is stressful for me because that means I have to pay for EVERYTHING we do for these couple weeks, as opposed to switching off paying for food and weed and such. The final issue with this is that she is pretty terrible at buying gifts, and often focuses more on the price tag than the items actual value to either of us. This brings me to my current situation. 

For her birthday this year, I got her AirPods because she’s been mentioning that she needs headphones and in high school, nothing matters more than flexing your socio-economic status. Her gift to me was tickets to Lallapalooza, which is a big music festival in Chicago that usually has a lot of big names. After she gave me the tickets, I checked out the lineup and realized that there were only 3 or 4 groups that I thought were even worth seeing, which I thought was odd because we have very similar music tastes. I asked her who she wanted to see, and she listed the same 4 that I had noticed. This is fine because it’s still a great gift and I like concerts, but when I asked her how much the tickets were, she told me that it was $400 for both of us. This is an unfathomable amount of money for my walnut brain to imagine spending on any gift for anyone, so I almost immediately tried talking her into selling them. I made very clear that I didn’t want the money from selling them, and she shouldn’t need to be completely broke for weeks so that we could go see like 3 decent shows and then leave. She quickly agreed that she should sell them and even looked relieved when I brought it up, so she sold them and got her money back plus a little extra, because by the time she sold them the official site’s tickets had sold out. It’s been about two weeks since then, and she hasn’t said a thing. This (finally) brings me to my WIBTA: Would it be selfish for me to ask her to get me a different gift considering I spent more money than I was comfortable with on hers and got nothing in return?

TL;DR: I spent $200 on AirPods, my girlfriend spent $400 on Lallapalooza tickets, we decided we didn’t want the Lallapalooza tickets so she sold them and kept the money. Is it horribly insensitive to ask for another gift?"	Asshole	1	0
bvpc6g	2019-06-01 20:45:12	nSania	AITA for making other plans than seeing my girlfriend?	"Just made it under 3000 characters. Also English isn't my mother tongue.

I’m currently searching for a place to live and the housing situation where I live is difficult.

Thankfully, my brother's best friend’s little sister has a spare room in her apartment and she thought it would be fun if I moved in. So I contacted her and invited her out to a beer, to see if we could actually stand each other before moving in. She thought it was a good idea, so we had plans to go out last night. My shift is a bit late and I meet her straight after (around 8 PM) On my way there my girlfriend invites me to the cinema. I say that unfortunately I can’t as I’m meeting up with my potential future roommate and if the night ends “early” enough that I have time to go to the Movies I’d have to go study instead, as I’ve got an upcoming exam. My girlfriend understood that and was fine with it-

Well I met with my future roommate and we hit it off, she’s really cool and fun to be around. All in all it was great. She thought so too and offered me the room, to which I happily accepted (The housing situation where I live is difficult so congratulations to me). Well the beer is flowing, and we end up talking and drinking until about 11 PM which is too late to go to the movies. My best friend who lives about 2 hours away calls me at 10, tells me he’s in town and asks if I want to go for a drink. I’ve had a couple of beers and have already decided that if I’m going home, I’m going to bed, so as I’m not studying for tonight I might as well go out. We rarely see each other so I happily agreed.

I did not think about my girlfriends offer to go to the cinema because that was already declined. It was kind of late and I did tell my SO that I might go for a drink with my best friend. She asked if I wasn’t going to study and I told her that it was too late and I’d gotten a few beers so it wouldn’t happen.

She then texted me goodnight so I went outside and called her. I told her that I got the place and that I thought it was amazing. I also told her goodnight and that I was going out with my best friend.

I go back in, wrap it up with my upcoming roommate and go meet my best friend.

She later texted me that she “couldn’t sleep, but its not like I’d care anyway”, which pissed me off, as she knows I care about her deeply.

Today she’s very mad saying that I made an active choice to not be with her that night. I told her that I had plans already - I did not know how long that was going to take, and that once those plans were done I planned something new. It was too late to go to the cinema at that point and she was going to bed anyway.

I’m not interested in the “you should reevaluate your relationship” or the “leave her”/“She should leave you” type of comments as I love her and want to be with her. 

I’m just interested in knowing whether or not I was the asshole last night.

bvpbpa	2019-06-01 20:44:04		WIBTA if I (18NB) got a tattoo while visiting my boyfriend (19M) without asking my mom for permission?	"Just want to preface this by saying I most likely won't go through with this because I'm a chicken, but it's one of those things I can't get out of my head.

My boyfriend and I are long distance and he's come to visit me twice in the nine months we've been dating; once at my dorm, once at my house. Last night, I booked the plane ticket to go visit him for the first time. My mom knows about this and is okay with it, especially considering I didn't use her money to buy the ticket..

For the last few years, I've wanted to get a tattoo at some point. I've known where I want it (left forearm) and what I want it to involve (symbol important between me and my mom + song lyric). The idea popped into my head to get one while I'm away, so that I could have my boyfriend there while I do it. I have no idea how I'd react to the pain and it'd make me feel a lot better having someone I trust so much being there.

My original plan was just to wait until after college to get a tattoo. And most likely, this is what'll happen still, but I can't pretend I'm not seriously considering doing it when I go visit.

The biggest issue is that I know how my mom feels about tattoos. In short; she's not a fan. She talks about her co-workers' tattoos and about how they'll fade and look awful once they're older, for just one example.

The thing is, I know the risk. I know there's a definite chance I'll regret it when I'm older. I know having visible tattoos can make it harder to get hired. But it's something I've wanted for so long and I think it's worth the risk. Besides, I've been so scared of doing literally anything my entire life and I'm tired of living in fear. I'm tired of overthinking everything and being terrified for the worst-case-scenarios constantly.

On the other hand, I have no idea how she would actually react. I know if I ask her she'd almost definitely say no, and if I just showed up with one, I really don't know what she would do. I still live with her as my permanent address, so basically over long breaks, and live out-of-state for college during the school year. She is helping quite a bit with my college, and obviously still pays the bills for my permanent home. I do have a part-time job on campus which helped me pay for my plane ticket and that would help me pay for my tattoo should I go through with it. So while it wouldn't be her money going towards the tattoo, I am more than aware of all the money and luxury she's providing for me.

So, if I did it, would I be the asshole? Would it make me an entitled, selfish, ungrateful brat for doing something I know my mom wouldn't approve of? Or would it make me an adult using my freedom to make choices I want to make? If I still live under my mom's roof do I even count as an adult? Or am I just an immature kid going through my rebellious phase?"	No A-holes here	1	0

I'm Swedish and midsummer's eve is a day when swedes get together, eat, drink and simply have a good time. I haven't been to a midsummer's eve shindig in almost 10 years due to living in Asia where it's not a thing. So... A friend invited me and my girlfriend to their place, I'm off that day but unfortunately my girl is not. I asked if she could take the day off but she said that she can't. So, I figured that I could go and that she wouldnt have an issue with it since I rarely hang out with friends or go out without her (2 times/month tops). I said it's too bad she can't come and that I'll have to drink and party for both of us - with a wink and smile. She said it's not cool as she's never done the midsummer's eve thing. She's from Poland and moved to Sweden to be with me 6 months ago and kinda uses this as an argument, saying she doesn't have friends here and that I should be more caring and show solidarity. 

Am I the asshole if I go instead of staying home with her in the evening?

Ps: I don't mind if she goes out without me. Just a couple of weeks ago she went to a fancy dinner event for some work thing but I couldn't go because I was working. She sent me photos and I said have fun and enjoy, eat for the both of us;)"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"Sorry for the long title, but basically I've been working at a movie theater for 2 weeks and a couple days ago, I served my old manager at Best Buy (a store that is located in the same shopping complex) and he called me today to come back and work for better pay and be in a more relaxed environment. I haven't worked there since 2017.

The issue is that I am scheduled to work up until next week at the movie theater and I am supposed to start my other job next week as well. I am not that attached to the movie theater, and I would like to leave ASAP. I don't want to work minimum wage for 2 weeks when I could have been making more at Best Buy.

bvp6am	2019-06-01 20:29:54		AITA for expecting my in-laws' loyalty over their close family friend?	"My mil has had the same bff since she was a teen. The 2 families have remained close though now living states apart. My husband and the oldest Barone child were close but have lost touch. My sil is still tight with the younger Barone who shares my first name. Growing up, my sil and Jane Barone agreed they'd marry each other's brother. The comment has been made that I screwed that up.

&#x200B;

My husband and I had been together for 6 or 7 years when I first met Jane Barone. Upon introduction, I was called ""the Other Jane."" It perturbed me, but I figured I'd never have to see her again since my husband has no inclination to keep in touch.

&#x200B;

My husband and I have been together 14 years. This past April, Jane Barone got married several states away. My husband and I attended only out of obligation to his mother and sister. I hadn't been more than 2 hours away from my terminally ill mother in years, and the trip cost us a small fortune. At the wedding, Jane Barone ignored me almost completely. She did, however, wait until I walked away to ambush my husband and demand he dance with her. He said he'd gladly dance with the groom and escaped the situation before I even knew what had happened. Later that evening, she came up to the two of us, addressed only him, and was on the verge of attempting to physically force him on the dance floor with her until her brother interrupted, made her angry over somethingoranother, and allowed my husband to once again slip into the shadows and avoid the situation without much conflict. During the 4+ hour reception, the groom was exceptionally reserved and terse when my husband and I attempted to talk sports/congratulate him. My husband's family didn't comment any of this, but I suspect they may not have really noticed. My husband was still so bothered a week later, that he talked to his sister about his feelings. He explained that when the Barones come visit next time, he would not feel comfortable spending time with them. She listened with respect, but didn't comment.

&#x200B;

When his mother and sister, whom I love and get along wonderfully with, say the name Jane, they mean Jane Barone. When they refer to me, I am (Husband)'s Jane. I realize that they've had many more years with Jane Barone than me, but at this point it hurts my feelings more each time I hear it.

&#x200B;

To further my frustration, my husband and I received a thank you note from Jane Barone and her new husband today. It was addressed only to my husband with an afterthought of a tiny ""Mr. and Mrs."" added awkwardly. It's obvious that Jane either, 1. Made a dig on purpose, or 2. Honestly forgot me and added the Mr. and Mrs. with a different pen hurriedly before putting it in the mail.

&#x200B;

I don't mind my husband being the star of the show. His social magnetism is one of the things I loved about him first. But I'm insulted and hurt.

bvp5ti	2019-06-01 20:28:37		AITA for getting mad at my ex for continuously sending me mixed messages?	"I've been trying to get back with my girlfriend for the last several months after some time apart. She started dating a new guy 3 months ago. She tells me how torn she is, how she wishes she could date both of us. She says the doesn't love him, but wants to keep seeing him to get to know him, but that she also can't be with me right now.

Back in April, she asked for some space and I gave it to her. She assured me no decisions had been made regarding her/our status. A few days later, she posted a photo of herself laying on his bed. The next day we spoked, and she admitted she'd hoped I would ""get the hint"" and move on. We talked some more, and her confusion came up again, because she said she'd been seeing the growth in me and that it's a big deal to her. She asked for space again, and I tried to give it to her. I broke it a few times because I felt stupid waiting for her to decide if this guy suits her or not, and told her I couldn't wait around. Each time she got upset at me for breaking the boundary. She has also broken her own request for space more than once. She apologizes for the mixed signal in doing so.

More recently, she told me she plans to break it off with him! She hadn't asked for space, and we'd been talking a lot, and she was giving me the vibes that she's really leaning toward me. Then she had a change of heart, and said she wants to keep seeing him. Again, she asked for space. Again, she said no decision was being made, and told me to relax and have faith that everything will work out as it should.

We openly follow each other's social media -- I know she looks at my shit, and she knows I look at hers. Well, last night on Twitter she mentioned having a boyfriend. Just a couple weeks ago I asked what she considers their status to be, and she specifically said that she wouldn't call him a boyfriend. I violated the no contact boundary and freaked out. She responded exactly as I thought she would, by accusing me of being unable to respect her wishes and her boundaries. She accused me of being unable to handle my emotions, and told me it scares her. She said that it was just a drunken tweet, and that *saying* she has a boyfriend doesn't *mean* she has a boyfriend.

I defended myself and pointed out how she's been giving me such mixed messages, and has once before told me she'd hoped I'd ""just get the hint"", and that this felt like the same thing happening again. She just said it's not her job to manage my emotions, and that I need to handle it better. I'm frustrated because she's owned up to her role in sending mixed messages, but then drops all responsibility when I react in a way that doesn't jive with her.

bvp2nd	2019-06-01 20:20:23	cherrybomb878	WIBTA and overreacting for reporting my pharmacist?	"So just to lay it all out there, I'm very prone to getting UTIs. Recently I started getting similar symptoms to having one, so my doctor prescribed some antibiotics. 

When I went to pick it up at a nearby pharmacy, they asked if I wanted the pharmacist to come over and explain how to take the medication. I assumed it would be instructions like, ""take it once a day for five days after a meal"" etc, so I agreed. 

She comes over and reads the name of the antibiotic out loud. Then she says, ""For a urinary infection, right?"" also in a very loud voice. My friend was standing nearby and heard the entire exchange. I was pretty shocked and just nodded uncomfortably. The pharmacist then told me to just drink lots of water and walked away. 

I was extremely unhappy with the occurrence because while the friend I was with is one of my closest friends, I didn't exactly want her to know I had a UTI. Well, now she does. Along with everyone else who was standing in the vicinity at the time. 

Also, this is more of a personal opinion, but the pharmacist's tone of voice was really dismissive and condescending, and I got the impression she was trying to shame me. But again this is what I personally felt during our exchange, and I could be wrong about it. 

I want to call the drugstore and make a complaint. But first, I asked another friend who is actually working as a pharmacist what she thought about this situation. She implied that the pharmacist was just doing her job, and that I would definitely be making a jerk move by reporting her.  

So now, I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just being really emotional since it happened a few days ago and I am letting that cloud my judgement. However I am still a bit upset to have had my privacy divulged like that.

EDIT:

Because people were asking, my friend was standing a good distance away. Not on the other side of the store, but a few aisles away, and still heard everything. 

I haven't called or anything yet. Just wanted to get unbiased input before I did anything just in case I was out of line.

Oh, also I didn't mention this in the original post since I thought it wasn't important. Maybe I should explain why I got the impression she was judging me. The pharmacist was of the same minority ethnic group as me, and people from my country are very conservative and judgmental. They'll call me out if I wear shorts/skirts and one of them even called my mom to tell me they saw me walking down the street with a boy when I was still in high school. I could have just been projecting from my prior negative experiences, but the way this pharmacist looked me up and down (I was wearing a really skintight skirt) really reminded me of these people.

bvp2m5	2019-06-01 20:20:19	MRWPlople	AITA for not moving from my fishing spot	"Anyone who has been to the beach in the summer knows it can get crowded. I dont mind the crowd and I do my best to avoid them but they dont avoid me.

I had been fishing this spot for a couple of hours and I was originally with a group of 4 other fishermen I had met today. As the day went on some of us left and it was only me and this other guy when a family of 6 came near us. 

At first the kids were just swimming in the shallow water but they slowly started drifting further and further which is usually fine except that they were not paying attention to how far they were drifting toward us(very annoying)

After about 30 minutes the mother came up to me and the other guy and asked if we could stop fishing since our casting area was now near her drifting kids.

I said no. I (as politely as I could stand) told her that we were here first and had been for a very long time and up until her family showed up we were staying in our own lane and others around us were as well.

Basically this became a 15 minute argument to which the mother gave up rudely said that she hopes I am proud of myself for ruining her family's day at the beach and they have now left.

I come from three generations of jewelers and though my family is no longer in the business, I still enjoy buying and selling loose gemstones for my own collection or to be set into custom pieces. I am extremely close to my husband’s family and I have either cheaply sold or simply given them stones/rings to propose to their significant others. 

My oldest brother-in-law has been dating his girlfriend for the past six years and while they are both a piece of work to say the least, they’re family so we tolerate them in doses. While we talk to and visit the other in-laws on a weekly basis, these two only come around when an event is going on or when they need money.... and they alway need money. My pending sister-in-law, while sweet at times is mostly bratty, tacky, spoiled and loud. She usually is the source of drama and my current headache at the moment. 

Every first Saturday of the month, the family hooks up for breakfast. Things started off normally today but they announced that finally, they were ready to tie the knot. We all had genuine excitement and breakfast turned into a boozy celebration. Then near the end while everyone is waiting for the check, they ask if they can come back to the house to pick out a ring. 

Just like that. Mic drop. It shocked me because they didn’t ask, he didn’t come to me or hubby beforehand to see if it was even a possibility. AND while I do have some options, I did not appreciate the assumption that I was going pull diamonds out of my ass without any discussion and straight up said no. I’d be willing to help them find something at their price point commercially. My inner Smaug woke up. 

All hell broke loose. She straight up throws a fit and begins calling out my other sister-in-laws who did have help from me with their rings and of course they are embarrassed. It’s not something we just talk about and I don’t hang it over anyone’s head. Brother-in-law starts trying to pick a fight with my husband telling him that he needs to “check me.” All of this is driving home that my on the spot decision was the right one. 

Drama apparently wants to have it’s day because while most of the table is trying to diffuse this until we can leave the restaurant, my mother-in-law of all people throws rocket fuel on the dumpster fire by saying that I’m being selfish and that there’s no reason why we shouldn’t help. She and I have had our differences in the past (during my and my husband’s crazy/horny teenage years) but haven’t openly feuded since we’ve been adults. 

Being the superhero that he his, my husband got us TF out of there but since this morning, we have been ignoring our phones as this plays out. We’re both pissed. 

—Update:

This took up my whole Saturday. MIL and FIL came over in person to talk about what happened. FIL agreed that BIL and future SIL were out of line and apologized in their behalf. 

Once this came out of his mouth, MIL had a meltdown. She still believed that a ring was deserved and even after explaining my reasoning basically said that, “I set a standard and since they can not afford it on their own, it was MY responsibility to step up.” I nearly lost it with her but instead of giving back all the venom that I’d been choking on, I left the house. 

FIL came outside and helped me calm down while she and Hubs talked. I haven’t gone in depth of how this affected things IRL but the fallout spread fast. The family has been through a lot recently and I did not want this to add more into the pot even though pettiness was strong within me. 

Between talking to him and texting my husband at ground zero, I actually decided to compromise. I have a pear shaped moissanite that I bought out of curiosity but did nothing with after it started trending a few years ago. For those who do not know, moissanite is a popular alternative to diamonds. It’s just been sitting in my collection and I figured why the fuck not. I could actually give them something and be done with it all providing that apologies were made to myself, the other inlaws and that they got it set on their own. FIL did not want me to offer it at first but I explained why and he reluctantly agreed. 

He called BIL, shred him for a moment but eventually told them my terms. I got on the line and explained what the moissanite was, the weight and cut since I had no idea what her preferences were. Other in-laws chose stones that weren’t traditional as well so I wanted to make sure she even wanted what I offered. They did. The change in their attitudes felt like this was the right choice. I told them to just come on over. Once they got here, they immediately apologized and Hubs got MIL to do the same though he gave me the worst side eye the whole time. Showed them the stone and future SIL just starts squirting tears out of happiness. I’m a big softy. Honestly, If things hadn’t gone down they way they did, I would have cried with her. 

I gave her the stone’s certification after the waterworks and things did a compete 360. She and BIL went from loving it to being offended that the damned thing wasn’t a diamond even though I’d explained this when giving the specs on the phone! She was actively FaceTiming her HER mom showing her the stone on her hand which lead to them calling me a horrible person for getting their hopes up. BIL stops short of insulting me again as Hubs stepped in and instead says that I’ve disrespecting his fiancé the whole time. MIL actually had the audacity to demand that SHE will pick out a “real stone” and to see what else I have like I’m a fucking sales clerk; not in my own house. Here I am staring at this twilight zone clusterfuck as they start arguing and I’m just standing in my kitchen watching it all play out again.

I have reached levels of real anger before but I think this was the first time I could say I felt actual fury. They pushed me to fulfill my lifelong dream to scream at people to get the fuck out of my house at the top of my lungs. (Repressed feelings much) Things got quiet fast and in that space, I snatched my shit back so fast that I accidentally dropped the moissy and it bounced or got kicked out of sight. Cue my inappropriate, fed up laughter. I couldn’t hold it in. 

Hubs and FIL got everyone out after that and as of now, they are banned from the house. I’m cutting them all off with no remorse. As of yet, no one has called me personally but word is that the Grand Dame is livid (I still don’t know why she’s so vehement about all of this tbh) while BIL and SIL are thinking about getting tattoos vs rings. I have no comment. Hubs feels like he’s at fault for everything but I’ve explained there’s no way I blame him for his family’s actions. He thought I was too nice to offer anything. FIL and I are linking up to discuss Reddit as he’s amazed by the platform so hey, something good came from this. 

We have looked for the stone and so far we have no fucking idea where it is. Confession time: it’s slightly satisfying that we can’t locate it. Where is Sister Unella when you need her?

I met Joe through Jane. We get along and he invited me to hang out with his group of buddies. They play D&D and do other shit that I don't have other opportunities to do, so I bonded pretty quickly with those guys and started hanging out with them outside of the context of being around Jane.

Jane and Joe had a messy breakup that started with an argument at a party I was at. I was witness to it and don't think that either of them are necessarily in the wrong. It's not that one of them did something horrible, they're both good people who were terrible for each other.

So Jane decides that she doesn't want to see me as long as I'm spending time with Joe. She says that being around me will remind her of him and that's emotionally difficult for her. She's genuinely having a tough time of it and I can see it the few times we've talked about it. It's been a few months now.

Tool's tour right now didn't hit Seattle, so my girlfriend and I fly to Nebraska to see them play.  Amazing show, Tool is our fav. We were in the first row of the 2nd level so we could lean on the rail while we stood up.  To our horror, no one else in our section was standing. Mostly everyone in the upper levels was sitting.  On the ground floor, people were standing but completely still for the.  Weirdest crowd I've ever seen at a sold out show, especially for as intense music as Tool.


I've told people this story and was called an asshole for standing and blocking others.  So help me here Reddit, am I the Asshole for standing at Tool? Or does Nebraska just suck?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvovlo	2019-06-01 20:01:55	mythrowawaysilly	AITA for getting upset at my GF for her mom's actions and her lack of reaction?	"A little background I've(33m) been with gf (29f) for 4 years on and off. Hasn't been the best relationship but we've been solid for the last 9 months. We live together and are generally happy. When I met her mom her mom had a lot of reservation about me and us. She wasn't rude to me but wasn't the most welcoming and I get it. But now it's been a few months and Ive noticed that she still doesn't care for me and that's ok but she's done things like this morning were she showed up to an event we're we were all at with coffee and food for everyone but me. It's not the first time something like this happens.

It really bothers me and I take it personal. My gf tells me not to that she's just like that and that reaction from her makes me mad. I get it don't make a scene to your mom and maybe don't tell her anything but to tell me there's nothing wrong with her action bothers me a lot. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvou9n	2019-06-01 19:58:42	SebPleb99	AITA for not cleaning up a public toilet after having diarrhea?	"This happened today and I still feel kind of bad about it but not really. I know the title makes it sound like I'm a huge asshole but hear me out first.

This whole day I have been plagued by lower stomach pain but my mom wanted to go shopping with me and my brother and since my parents recently split up and she only gets to see me every other weekend because I live about 2 hours away, I couldn't bring myself to say no. 
About 1 hour into shopping I feel that something big needs to leave my body so I rush to the closest toilet and  do my thing in the most silent way possible. That is, until the cleaning lady starts to knock heavily on my door to let me know that she wants to clean. I say ""occupied"" and continue my ""shitty"" business. 2 minutes later she knocks again, this time in a more aggressive way and, knowing that I would still need another 10 minutes or so, I tell her that I'll be done soon.
Well, guess what. 2 minutes later she knocks again and then 2 minutes later again. I got pretty pissed at this point because I was already in pain and just wanted to finish my business in silence. 

When she knocked for the 5th time I was so mad that, when I was done, I decided to leave all the shit stains that my explosion had caused on the toilet instead of cleaning them up, like I normally would.

So yeah, that's basically it, I know it's not a nice thing to do and I'm not a fan of the whole ""I don't have to clean up because it's the cleaning lady's job"" mentality, but I feel like my anger and frustration was justified here.

bvotjs	2019-06-01 19:56:51		AITA for not allowing a friend back in my life after he ostracized me for having an affair?	"Obligatory on mobile and throwaway account. Trying to make this as short as possible.

So my significant other (25f) and I (28m) began our relationship through an affair. This, no doubt, makes both of us serious assholes, and that is not what I'm asking for feedback on. We dated a little in highschool, broke up due to the age difference and timing, and reconnected years later while she was married. It started as an emotional affair and went from there. My SO realized she needed to tell her husband and leave him, which she did. (And please no, ""if she did it to him, she'll do it to you comments."") We truly love eachother more than anything, and wish we would have gone about this in a way that didnt cause people to get hurt. They are now divorced and we have been together for about a year now. We have admitted what we did was extremely selfish, hurtful, and wrong, but we do not regret being together. My SO made sure her ex-husband got everything he wanted from their assets during the divorce.

Anyway, we clearly lost some friends through this process because of our asshole behavior and affair. I also was previously engaged to an old friend of my SO way before this and that caused an explosion in their entire friend group when they found out she and I were now together. We were prepared to lose some people in our lives and now we are just trying to move on and right our past wrongs and not do anything that selfish ever again.

One of my best friends (I'll call Gary) decided he could no longer associate with me because of my actions. It hurt, but of course I understood because I did a terrible thing, and there are consequences to actions. He called us a lot of names, called my SO a whore, and said he would never be able to trust me around his girlfriend. I didnt argue with him and accepted that he no longer wanted in my life. Also, a lot of our friends have made mistakes like this but I am the only one he has chosen to ostracize. 

Cut to a few weeks ago. Gary reaches out and is trying to be my friend again. His dad was just diagnosed with cancer, and he knows I went through something similar, and now he wants me to be there for him through this. I told him I was so sorry about his dad, but that I didnt want to be his friend anymore and to not reach back out to me. A lot of our mutual friends are calling me a dick for this.

bvor6x	2019-06-01 19:50:34	DramaticSite	WIBTA for contacting the employer of a person who screwed me?	"My family and I are looking at dogs to buy. We found one that's the same breed as our late dog but the only problem it's four hours away. That's an 8 hour round trip. My wife was on board, I was on board, and our son was tickled pink, so we arranged with the seller to have a meet and greet yesterday and if things went smooth, we'd come home with our puppy. It was just me making the drive.

Normally when I make a long distance private sale/buy like this, I try to make sure I don't want my time. I looked up their phone number, it matches the address provided, even the name is ascribed to that address. It's a farm, a nice looking one at that, and I can find the sellers on Facebook. The woman I was speaking to works at a bakery. Everything is showing zero red flags so I go for it.

So I make the grueling trip, I've never even driven this far in one go before. I leave at 8am to be there around noon, and I end up on their property at 12:15. Text them to let them know I'm here, no answer. Go up to the door, no answer. I'm kind of confused as to what to do, so I wait around for 30min. Finally a truck pulls into the driveway and it's the woman I was speaking to over the phone and through e-mail.

She told me she sold the puppy a few days ago. This contradicts what she told me the morning of just before I left to visit her. She said she'd be home waiting with the puppy. Fuck right off, she sold it days ago, never told me, lead me on knowing I'm making this god awful trip. She laughed and said a fake sorry and told me to leave.

Would I be the asshole for contacting her employer by means of a Facebook post or review. Something along the lines of my story and tagging her business ""xyz, you should know you employ dirtbags"". It's really all I can do to get at least some petty revenge. Maybe they'd reconsider her employment, maybe they won't give a shit. It'll probably do nothing, but I want her community to know what a piece of work she is."	Asshole	0	0

For context my grandad had a house in a popular holiday location. After he died my parents inherited a share of it, along with his other children. This house has a main area and a separate flat which is rented out. 

A few months ago my friends and I decided to take a holiday there after repeated offers from my mum for years. We checked that the flat was free and made sure none of my family were planning to go there that week, then booked time off of work.

Today we travelled to the house, I called my parents when we were near to check what time the previous renters would be gone so we could stay out of their way. She said that they had gone, however she and my dad would be there for another 2 days as there was a problem they had to fix, which they had known about for almost a week.

After asking why she hadn't told me she was going to be there, as I had previously said my friends didn't want to use up their holiday time if they were there, she told me ""if I said we would be there you wouldn't have come"".

After that we booked a nearby hostel until they said they the problem would be fixed, and sent a message to my parents. They sent a few responses of ""why? We're very upset"",  told me I can't stop them from using their house and said don't know why I don't want to spend more time with them.

I never complained that they were in the house, I understand the repairs needed to be done. I'm just upset that she deliberately avoided telling me because she knew we would want to cancel the holiday.

"Alright so here's a bit of backstory Im one of 6 siblings I have 4 sisters who are adopted (2 older 2 younger) and one twin brother. I grew up in a bad part of Philadelphia,PA and my aunt didn't like that so when I turned 13-14 in 2011 about to enter high school my aunt begged my dad to let me and my younger siblings come stay with her in Ohio where we wouldn't have to go to school in such a horrible place. My older sisters had already graduated. One of them moved out to go to college and my oldest sister had went to the navy. 

Fast forward 8 years my oldest sister is on leave and coming to visist me cause I moved in with a high school friend earlier this year about 30 mins away from the rest of my family.

bvopga	2019-06-01 19:45:53		AITA for not wanting my disturbed niece in my house?	"I have a soon-to-be 19 year-old niece (MN). My sister (MS) had her when she was a teenager. MS and MN had a very tumultuous beginning together. MS was still young, selfish and immature as most teenagers are and she felt that it was totally ok to bring a toddler or young child to parties or to have people over to her house all the time. MN’s first circle of friends were older teenagers and young adults for a long time. She didn’t get a lot of attention outside of party time except for when my sister was tired or frustrated and then she would get irritated with her. MN spent a lot of time at my parents’ house too. 

Over the past years MS has done a lot of growing and changing and she is in a much better place. MN however has spent most of her teen years in group homes or correctional group homes. She started being violent at school and at home when she was young and this escalated to her having multiple run-ins with police. She steals, drinks excessively, is promiscuous, and uses drugs regularly. She is involved in other criminal activity too but there’s too much to go into here. 

I have not wanted a relationship with MN since she was a child. My husband (MH) and I used to babysit her until she started threatening us with telling people in the family that we hit her. This would be when she didn’t get her way (like we left the park sooner then she wanted, or wouldn’t buy her something). I remember the day she did tell my mother that I hit her, right in front of me and she actually had the nerve to smirk at me behind my mother’s back. MN was 7 at the time. 

My house usually is where the family comes for the big dinners but I have refused to let MN come. I don’t trust her, she’s violent, and she’s generally unlikeable. The fact that she turns on the charm to my father and he buys it is sickening. She can manipulate anyone. MS insists that if she’s invited somewhere than MN is too. It’s caused quite a bit of conflict. My parents have never believed that MN was “as bad as we make her out to be” and blamed everything on MS. The fact that they undermined MS repeatedly when she was trying to make positive changes in her parenting (albeit too late it seems) and the effect their negative behaviour had on MN’s development is lost on them. 

I am not so cold or ignorant to know that when she was young, all the crappy stuff was not MN’s fault. But I feel my worries about safety trump that empathy, even if MN has not (yet) stolen from me or been violent towards me.

bvooyt	2019-06-01 19:44:41	jab1992	AITA for refusing to attend my Dad's 50th birthday party?	"My Dad left my Mum 9 years ago for her then best friend (I was 18 at the time and my brother was 15). Her husband had left her for another woman like a year before and so her and her kids spent a lot of time with us as kind of something for her to do and presumably try to take her mind off it. Somewhere down the line this resulted in her and my Dad starting an affair and then my Dad left to be with her, leading to a whole lot of he-said-she-said where this woman seemed to use a mixture of my Mum's secrets and outright lies and exaggerations to make my Dad not just prefer her but completely hate my Mum. 

Fast forward to now. Dad is married to other woman. Me and my brother have a reasonably good relationship with our him, brother still lives with Mum but sees Dad most weeks and if I visit home I stay at Mum's but usually see my Dad by visiting grandparents together. 

Dad's 50th birthday is coming up and he wants a big happy family party round his house. Which, unsurprisingly I think, my brother and I do not wish to attend. Neither of us have any interest in ever seeing this woman again. I've forgiven my Dad and love spending time with him still but I don't think I'll ever forgive her and frankly I don't want to. I suggested we go for a separate dinner: brother, me, Dad, maybe grandparents, but he decides he doesn't want us to because he wants us to move on and to celebrate as a big happy family (which we're not and I doubt we ever will be). I get that he just wants us to be part of his family but I just cannot be part of her family and he just doesn't get this (despite the fact he won't be anywhere with my Mum so I sure as hell can't have anything whole family related). 

We had a big argument the other day over messages, which I admittedly started by saying he didn't want to be our family anymore if we couldn't be hers. End of that was we're not going but he doesn't want to do a separate one with us so we'll just see him Father's day the next week and he can have presents that day instead. I don't know if it's worth noting my brother is in the group chat and said he agreed with everything I said.

bvook2	2019-06-01 19:43:33	aitasiblings	AITA for not telling my husband that I know his secret	"My husband and I have been married for almost two decades. We have a daughter who is my favorite person on this earth. She is so fantastic. She will be starting her senior year of high school and is preparing to apply for colleges.

I was contacted recently by another woman, who informed me that my husband had an affair with her, and when she found out about me, he arranged to pay child support for their child under the table so that I wouldn't find out. She sent me a number of documents recording bank transfers, which I was able to match to transfers from our accounts, as well as photos of my husband with their child through the years. She also provided the dates of his visits to her, which line up with several of his business trips. 

I was totally devastated and took the time to think it over and verify everything before I confronted my husband. I have decided that I am going to wait a year until I tell him that I know and file for divorce. It will be a terrible year for me but I know I can fake it since he's traveling for work a lot anyway. I have decided to do this for several reasons:

1. Our daughter will be applying to college soon and will be starting a really important year. I don't want to blow her life up with a divorce and the bombshell that her father was unfaithful and now she has a sibling that neither of us knew about. 
2. My husband has many more financial resources than I do. I am well aware that if I file for divorce while our daughter still lives at home, he will leave me to care for her and will make me fight tooth and nail for monetary support and will likely drain me with legal fees, as he tends to be litigious. I make enough to support myself comfortably, but not enough to comfortably support myself and my daughter.
3. I fear that opening this door will open others. That is, I worry that he may have other children that I don't know about, which would only magnify the hurt for both me and my daughter, and I don't think that now is the time to handle it.

My question is, does my plan make me an asshole? I feel slimy not telling him right now and faking my affection for him, but I fear for my daughter's wellbeing and my own ability to support us. AITA?

bvomn2	2019-06-01 19:38:23	LlamaResistance	AITA for not immediately agreeing with my wife re: potential Pregnancy Discrimination issue	"For background, my wife (31F, facilities engineer) and myself (36M, assistant chief facilities engineer) both work for the same company but at different sites. Her supervisor expressed that he wanted to reassign one of her normal job duties to another engineer as she was pregnant and was concerned about exposure being potentially harmful to the fetus. Her boss is a bit chauvinistic and she has been very vocal to me about her issues with him.

Two days ago my wife calls me at work to ask for my assistance proof reading an email she is going to send to her Chief Engineer (shore-side engineering) regarding his desire to change one of her duties as she is now pregnant. Specifically she was performing the water chemistry testing and adjustments of 3 large swimming pools at her site. He cited his reasoning as wanting to limit her &amp; baby to be's exposure to those chemicals. She is not happy about this as she has been performing this task for the last three years and has reduced the number of chemistry problems significantly. Here in the US this certainly could be construed as Pregnancy discrimination (see: [US EEOC Pregnancy Discrimination](https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/fs-preg.cfm)) given his reason which he disclosed to her.

I listened and agreed to what she said regarding this but withheld full judgement because I was not sure if any of the chemicals which she worked with had Reproductive Toxicity hazards which would pose a significant liability were something to happen or if her protective gear failed. I told her there were a few situations here that might be of concern and that I was not sure if there were potentially other issues that may allow her Chief to do this. She was not happy about this at all. She tersely ended the call and when I had my next break, I did some research. Suffice it to say there is very little about her situation. Most every concern I could find being addressed was either:

1. I work in a hazardous position and my employer wont reassign me (violation)
2. I work in a hazardous position and my employer will reassign me but at a lower job title/pay (violation)
3. I work in a hazardous position and my employer forces me into a new position with change to schedule or pay (violation)

Her situation, I work in a hazardous position and my task gets reassigned with no change to pay, schedule or title.

Instead of sending me the email to proof, she sends me this with a quote from the above linked website:

&gt;**I know longer want your opinion this was taken off the eagle opportunity website in regards to women’s rights. I hope you never have a female employee because you seem to share his mentality.**   
**An employer cannot force you to take time off or change jobs, if you're still able to do your job:**

She's marrying my brother in October(I'm a bridesmaid) and they're holding a joint bachelor/bachelorette party in July so I have been posting on the bridesmaid group page and been messaging her and her sister(the maid of honor) with different places we could go to for it. I only found out she blocked me when I tried to send her a link to an Air B&B that could house everybody, and looking back on it her tone switched from how she usually addresses people to how she started addressing me, but she had never outright said anything about it either. I guess it got to be too much. It's understandable, I'm unemployed at the moment and looking for jobs with a lot of spare time on my hands that I was filling with ""helping out"" but she has a lot on her plate with work and planning so it must have gotten annoying. I really didn't mean to become that guy but now I'm just wondering if she actually wants me in the wedding or if she just asked me out of obligation.

Every other interaction we've had in person and online has been fine, she's always been bubbly and sweet, that's why this is kind of hitting hard. I know I fucked up but what should I do? Should I just keep my mouth shut or should I drop out of the wedding party altogether?

UPDATE: So it turns out I'm actually incompetent; when I was telling my friends about this I was trying to go through my last messages with her right before I found out I had gotten ""blocked""

Every time I tried to send individual friends the same link to the air bnb(through the air bnb app) it would show the same ""blocked"" message that it showed with her. On signing into the browser air bnb site and trying to send the link through that it turns out that I WAS NEVER BLOCKED and that sending an air bnb link through messenger on my phone would always result in a ""blocked"" message.

So after all I AM the asshole since I went and assumed that my super sweet sister-in-law would ever block me on messenger in the first place.

bvok4r	2019-06-01 19:32:08	annizoli	AITA for getting a friend fired?	"So I am the head coach for a local summer swim team of about 180 kids this summer. 

In a team this size, we need lots of coaches, and I have 5 assistant coaches. Two of them were assistant coaches when I was, and have continued to coach. The other three that were hired for this summer had all previously swum for the team and were either juniors or seniors in high school. I knew all three of  them, but used to be close friends with a girl we’ll call Janice.

The season started three weeks ago, while college was out and high school was still in session. That meant that the three newbies would have to miss a few days here and there for HS graduation and exams, perfectly fine. Janice misses coming to work 3/4 days a week for two weeks straight. Her excuses: PT, Band, Band, Band, Band, and Band. I was also in band in the same HS, and I know how much of a pain he is when you have to miss an event, however, I realized that my job needs to be a priority and skipped several band events and rehearsals to make it to my job. Janice did not.

I expressed my concerns about Janice’s absence and the safety issues it was causing to my boss and the other experienced coaches, and we all agreed that something needed to change. When I spoke to Janice, she told me that she didn’t mean to miss so much practice and she was sorry. I asked when she would be able to come to practice, and it turns out she would only be able to be at 12 more practices for the rest of the season (season ends July 6th). When she was hired, she said that she would only rarely miss a practice.

I’ve already had to deal with safety issues to do the volume of the team and limited coaches and now Janice is telling me that she frequently can’t be here. Janice, myself, and my boss all agree that she isn’t a good fit for coaching this year and we will need to find a replacement.

I have another friend, Abby, who is new to our pool, but I know well and is a former year-round swimmer, and suggest to my boss that she would be a good fit to quickly replace Janice. Boss agrees, and she had her first day on Thursday, and everything went well.

So everything is resolved for the moment, but I feel like shit. I kicked Janice out of a job she wanted and handed it to another friend who is an outsider to the program and unknown to everyone other than myself and my boss.

side note- Janice still has a job at the pool we run the swim team through and she’ll still get hours, just not with the swim team.

tldr - assistant coach who I used to be friends with can barely ever make it to practice, I get my boss to fire her, and suggest a friend of mine for the position."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I don't even remember what kind it was (had a French name), and have no idea how much they spent on it.

But anyway, long story short, I felt like sangria and decided to make it out of the bottle of wine I was just gifted, which I then proceeded to serve to my guests. It was not until later that someone let me know (to my surprise) that the couple who brought me the wine was a little offended by this. Apparently this was a major ""fauxpas"" on my part, which I didn't even realize. 

Am I clueless hostess, or were they just being petty wine snobs?"	No A-holes here	0	0
bvoizb	2019-06-01 19:29:10		AITA for leaving work early after someone who I was filling in for decided to come in?	"Okay, so I am a 16 year old who works at a Carwash as a part time job for extra money. The girl I was filling in for is a junior in high school (let’s call her Kelsey). 

Kelsey was taking the ACT and my manager asked me to fill in for her today. I didn’t want to, but it was money to be made so I agreed. I worked for about an hour or so until Kelsey showed up. Everyone was pretty confused about it but we all found out that our manager never told Kelsey to stay home today after she takes her ACT. 

So I ask if I can go home now that she’s here and they all said I was good to go.

I feel bad letting her work after taking the ACT but I wasn’t even supposed to work today anyways, and the manager didn’t even bother to tell Kelsey that she can stay home! So AITA for leaving work early because Kelsey showed up for her shift that I was filling in for? 

The shift is 12PM to 5PM by the way."		1	0

bvoi38	2019-06-01 19:26:42	lunar_module720	AITA for thinking kids shouldn't be brought to alcohol focused establishments?	"Yesterday my girlfriend and I went to Golden Road Brewery in Anaheim, CA. It was around 5 on Friday afternoon, they do serve food but this is a craft brewery and most people are just drinking. They make their money off of beer. They have a large outdoor area with yard games. There were probably 20 kids (3-8) running around unattended, zigging and zagging through crowds of people who are standing around holding beer. Kids were throwing the bean bags for cornhole around, crawling all over the area to the point where nobody could play the games. I understand this place isn't a ""bar"" but my girlfriend and I have noticed that recently parents are going out drinking at these breweries and treating them like day cares for their children. These places are drinking establishments, people get drunk and stupid. It's not a restaurant. Not a daycare for your children while the parents sit there and get drunk and laugh about their kids being crazy. It's one thing if your kids are behaved, but we've been nothing many of the kids at these breweries are not well behaved. Some of these kids were actually pretty funny to watch, I'll be honest. Only because we were sitting off to the side and not trying to play any of the yard games or stand anywhere near the kids. We did see several close calls where people were getting annoyed and almost tripped and dropped their beers or asked where kids parents were. One group was trying to play cornhole and the kids kept moving the board and bean bags every time they threw a bag. At some point someone is going to get upset, and yell at a kid, or step in a kid and it'll be their fault, not the kid's or the parent's. 
        After this, around 9 o'clock we went to a restaurant/club that stops serving food after 9. We went upstairs to where they have pool tables and dart boards. We were up there playing pool, and a couple brings their two little kids up there and let's them loose while they play pool and darts! It's 9 at night and these 5 year old kids are out around people who are playing with darts and drinking. Places that make their money mainly off of alcohol shouldn't let their customers bring their kids. Some parents can be trusted, but sadly many parents are just too irresponsible. I understand it's hard for parents to go out and have fun when they have kids... They have to bring them everywhere, sometimes they can't afford a babysitter. My parents used to take me with them some times, but I wasn't running around the billiards room of bars at 9 at night while people were throwing darts. I'd sit at the bar at a restaurant with them during dinner. When they did go have fun, I had someone to watch me. Or a play date, or we brought the party back to our house. I think some of these breweries need to take some responsibility and say if you can't attend to your kids you need to leave, because it's clear that some of these parents aren't up to the responsibility."

bvohaw	2019-06-01 19:24:35	unexpected-headache	AITA for joking around? AITA for not helping?	"This is my first post so I apologize for formatting and stuff. My original post was too long so I copied the TLDRs and pasted them here. 

My friend (R) went on her first date with her bf (C) and brought me and another friend (G) along. R didn’t make conversation with her bf and I felt bad so I did. This cause me to be unusually calm.G started to be loud and cause a disturbance because G is one of those friends who are loud and fun to be around. After a while of talking to C, I tried to make R and C talk because this was their date. R then took me to the bathroom and said how it was more mine and C’s date then her’s. I told her to talk to him and told her why I did talk to him. She refused to speak to him when I told her to talk to him. Then C joked to me saying “We should say we’re separated from them (laugh)”. The them refers to R and G. I joked back “(laugh) yeah we should.” It all seemed to be normal. 

We payed walked out. We then went to the park and it seemed to be normal. Me and G try to make R and C talk. R refuses. C leaves soon after and R is suddenly sad. Me and G try to cheer her up. R doesn’t budge. I take a long nap. I woke up and there was video call on Instagram and I went on it had R, C, and another friend P. C left for some reason. R explained the date to P who wasn’t there. “Then unexpected-headache started to include me in G’s things.” She became pissed at me all of a sudden but not at C so I said “C said (what he said) first and I joked along.” She said “it didn’t matter who said it first”. I responded “alright” I went on muted and then C joins. She becomes all sweet and says hi to him. I stay on mute for a little long said “my dad is yelling at me” and then immediately left R and P and C were talking about what happened after he left (except the part where she was sad) so I doubt they heard me. 

TLDR for first AITA: Friend is mad at me for Joking with Bf that she made a disturbance. Am I the Asshole?

The next morning R texted onto a group chat about everything wrong in her life. P sent how she was abusive to me and all of the rest of her friends. R screams at P bringing up how her ex abused her for some reason then saying how only one of her friends were real. The she said bye before leaving the chat. Am I the asshole for not doing anything?

Edit: Some more info has come up. Basically she said everyone dropped her when life gets though and how only 2 people has stayed with her throughout. I’ve always been there for her and have stayed up late. So am I the asshole for not doing anything?

TLDR for second AITA: Friend sends in group chat everything wrong with her life rn and how she needs her friends. Another friend brings up how she is abusive but never said she is. Friend gets mad and says how only one of her friends are good. Says bye and doesn’t respond to anything else. Am I the Asshole for not doing anything?"	Not enough info	0	0

bvogg4	2019-06-01 19:22:18	Tinystalker	AITA for not wanting to go to my brother's graduation ceremony?	"First off, I should say this has nothing to do with my relationship with my brother. He (17) and I get along fine. He's graduating from high school, and his ceremony is today. He has stated multiple times that not only does he not want to participate in the ceremony (you don't need to to graduate), but also that he doesn't care if me or my youngest brother (13) watch the ceremony. Trust me when I say that he wouldn't give a damn or take it personally if I wasn't there, and I told him I didn't care if he wasn't at my grad (I had my ceremony 2 years ago) We both think the ceremony is a load of bullshit.

The only reason I'm going I'd because my mother is making me. I'm 19 and I live at home. My mother threaten to kick me out of the hoyse if I didn't come. Not in a joking way, either, as I thought. We are now at the venue waiting for the ceremony to get started. My mother screamed at my graduating brother because he had the audacity to want to talk to his friends without her present. When she took a picture of us, I did the bunny ear hand thing behind my brothers' heads, and she yelled at me for that. My youngest brother tried to asked her to calm down and she told him ""Just because you're in a suite doesn't mean you're an adult"". She also refuses to let me use my phone, on silent, when the ceremony begins. Keep in mind, there is no rule against cellphone use during the ceremony as along as there's no volume (I asked one of the organizers). The ceremony is 3 and a half hours long. I have autism and ADHD, and she knows I don't do well sitting in boring spaces for long periods of time without stimulation. 

To top things off, it's not like I didn't have anything better to do today. I was going to take my youngest brother out to our town wide garage sale, and later hang out with my friends, which I'm not able to do very often because our schedules often clash. I told my mother this, and she doesn't care.

So, am I in the wrong for this? I think I'm not, but based on how mad my mom is getting, I don't know. If you guys have any more questions about the situation, I'll try to answer them the best I can in the comments."	Not the A-hole	0	0

A couple of weeks ago, I found a screenshot of a chat from over 3 years ago of this dude who was my first kiss.... who went on to tell me that his old, ""much hotter"" girlfriend hit him up, but that he still liked me, and basically gaslit me and then ghosted me. That chat was some incredibly sappy shit about how he hoped we'd ""LaSt FoReVeR"" and I found it incredibly funny, so I posted it on there where my friends and I roasted him in the comments. Today, I got a call from said ex (let's call him C), saying that someone saw that post and screenshots are being shared of it. To reiterate, my finsta is completely closed off from people in my old school circuit except for a few friends who I thought I could trust enough. However that screenshot leaked, it wasn't with my consent, and at any rate it's a stupid laugh over some dumb shit both of us said three years ago. When I talked, he asked me to ""Let it go"" to which I replied that I am in a very loving relationship right now with my boyfriend, that this was for laughs, and that I even roast myself and close friends on my shitpost account. AITA for sharing that screenshot on my finsta?

bvof53	2019-06-01 19:18:45	theonewithcurlyhair	AITA for not wanting to talk to my husband after he said something about my looks	"Some people might think this is belongs in relationship advice, but I want to know if my reaction is right and NOT a perspective on my relationship itself. 

So my husband lives in another country and I am joining him after I graduate from college. It has been a while that I have seen him since I was busy with my last semester and he didn't get the time to visit me.

Anyway, it has been over three months and we didn't have much sex the last time he visited me. 

I am moving next week after my graduation party. I am truly excited. We were on a call and I mentioned that I should start birth control since we would be living together. He said, ""Yeah but that is rarely going to happen."" I don't know if it was a joke, but not having a healthy sex life would bother me. I mentioned that and his reply was, ""Maybe you should lose some weight then.""

Now I don't judge him for that. I understand that being physically attractive is important to some people. But it is not like I have become huge (I don't want to fat shame people). I am dealing with PCOS and this tends to happen to me. I felt pretty annoyed and did not want to talk to him after this. I haven't contacted him since this. 

He is from a different country than me and maybe culturally it is okay for him to say this, but I just find it extremely insensitive. 

AITA for not wanting to talk to him? 

PS: not that it matters, but I had plenty of chances to get laid in college here. So I don't feel unattractive. But I'm definitely more conscious about my looks now."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Now when I suggested that we should split the supplies from now on , she wasn't keen on the idea as she suggests that everything in this place is shared even though I probably spend a lot more than her. She buys the cheapest possible items such as dish soap , tooth picks, and cooking oil.

bvoduy	2019-06-01 19:15:31	LinaHime	WIBTA if I told my sister to buy herself new headphones?	"First post was slightly too long. Some additional infos will be in the comments. 

Short info, my sister is 14 and I am 19. We have a brother who is 16.

So, my sister has recently found some old headphones of hers and she thinks they're amazing. They're one of these huge ones that completely cover your ears. Soundproof and all. In all fairness, they do look cool. 

However, my sister watches videos or plays games with sound on on her phone pretty much all day long when she's at home. I don't judge her, I'm perfectly fine with that, and she's been doing it a long time before she found these headphones.

Since then she wears them constantly though. Remember that I said they're soundproof? Yeah. She doesn't hear us when we call her. She doesn't hear us if we shout through the house, she doesn't hear the doorbell, and if she has the volume turned up she doesn't even hear us knock at the door of her room. And that is very damn annoying.

Our brother and I have had the same problem in the past, where we didn't hear others calling our name or stuff. My brother eventually stopped using headphones altogether and he spends most of his time with his friends so he isn't home much and this isn't really an issue with him. I only buy these small stringy headphones and (most of the time) only use one of them nowadays so I hear people when they call me and stuff.

My point is, my sister knows how annoying it is to have to run upstairs every time you want to talk to someone, or call them down for dinner or other things. 

I have mentioned this issue with her multiple times, but her response is basically ""Oopsie, sorry for that"". I've tried asking her to not use them when she's in her room (the walls are thick enough that I wouldn't hear her videos or games from my room next door) with no success, and my parents weren't able to get through to her either. 

I'm not planning to force her to do anything, but at this point I feel like I can't do anything but sit her down and tell her that I think she's kind of being an asshole by forcing us to come to her room every time we want something from her (she doesn't check WhatsApp regularly so messaging her isn't really an option).

In my opinion this could be solved if she had different headphones that don't completely cover her ears if she wears them. My sister has had her confirmation recently (last week) and she pretty much only got money, most of which will be going to her bank account for her savings.

She absolutely has enough money to spend on some headphones and I think she should because it's really impacting the mood in our house.

bvo8ph	2019-06-01 19:01:19	Never_a_bride_aita	AITA for wanting to get married?	"Hurt and getting bitter, want an honest opinion. I have no one to talk to in real life, so I'm going to the internet!

Background: I'm 24F, my boyfriend is 26M. Met in high school, he and his family helped me out of a toxic relationship with my parents, been living together a few years now. Relationship is 10/10; if anything, I'm the one who needs to shape up on it.

Also, I'm on disability & recently had to acknowledge him as my spouse, which affects my monthly support/earning rates. It was an accident, and honestly I would have lied about it, but I'm shit at lying and was afraid of getting caught and getting into trouble with my status. This is relevant.

The issue:

I always wanted to get married at some point. A day where I can wear white, feel pretty, and feel loved. I don't think that is uncommon.

With my partner, I knew I wanted to be with him forever a while ago. We're building a life together. I thought he would propose eventually, and I knew there would never be a ""perfect"" time, but I thought sometime before ten years is average.

We're getting some rings made (at my insistence it was important to me) but then he off handedly mentioned he does't know what he's gonna tell people if they notice. He's a private/reserved person, but that struck me as...odd. Like he's ashamed to be marked as in a relationship. 

So I point blank asked him why he isn't interested in marriage. And I hate the answer.

His points (no particular order)
1. We're already common law, so legally we're spouses. 
2. He sees no importance in the ceremony or the title of ""Husband and Wife."" It doesn't change out relationship, just what it's called.
3. It's money and effort he doesn't want to spend.
4. He feels pressured and doesn't want to be pressured into anything.
5. He just thinks it's stupid.
6. He's not ready to commit yet (?????)

Also, as life has its ups and downs, recently shit hit the fan. He lost his father, quit a job that screwed him over so he can help out his family business, which is reeling both from the lost family member and the lost business owner. So I get that my timing was off to starting whinging about marriage/rings, b/c of course his father's passing and the consequences are more important. But I was feeling this way before and now, knowing he didn't intend on marriage at all...I don't know how to feel. Gross, I guess.

For the disability thing, if I had been a better liar, and kept our relationship a secret, I would be okay with not getting married, obviously. But since the cat's out of the bag anyways, I figured making it more official wouldn't matter anymore.

Even a courthouse wedding where we sign papers and get it over with, with his best friend as a witness (he specifically offered), no frills or bells, is off the table. He just doesn't care and is actively against it because of his other listed reasons. 

The rings just feel like a forced, hallow, pyrrhic now."	Not the A-hole	0	0

My mom buys them alcohol which I strongly warn against because my sister is irresponsible and wants to seem grown up so she’ll try to drink more than everyone. 

At like 3 am, my mom gets a call from my sister, crying that she’s throwing up and is too drunk and needs help. I’m work with college freshman a lot since I’m an RA at my college, so I help her relax and instruct her to go to the floor’s RA to get medical help since I can’t really gauge if my sister is going to get poisoning, or has just never been so drunk before. She does, and the campus police come to check on her. Then we have to DRIVE TO HER BOYFRIEND’S fucking COLLEGE TO GET HER AND HER BOYFRIEND. About a 2 hour drive to and back. Not to mention, my girlfriend who was staying over at the time had to get up and drive my sister’s car since I couldn’t. 

My mom starts bawling uncontrollably and instead of consoling her, I yell at her for being so irresponsible and dumb for giving a kid alcohol when I told her how she would handle it. And it wasn’t very well. My mom started crying more which made me feel terrible as I’m sure she felt like shit already, but I was so mad. This could’ve been prevented so easily. 

Am I the asshole for doing that? I feel bad but I truly feel like my mom was trying to be more of a friend than a parent."	No A-holes here	0	0

bvo66u	2019-06-01 18:54:46		AITA for being more cautious about making plans with my girlfriend?	"I'll preface by saying I fully understand that this is a very small problem that will probably be forgotten eventually, I just want to know for sure whether my actions are justifiable or not.

So lately, my girlfriend and I's plans have been slowing down in terms of frequency quite a bit. We're still in high school so we can see each other after school maybe once a week or so, but hardly ever outside of that. She works on weekends and has other friends to hang out with. That's not the problem, the problem is that we would already have plans made ahead of time and she's began cancelling to do other things. 

The first example was maybe two months ago, we make plans to see a movie on friday a week ahead of time. The night before, her friends ask her to go hammocking with her, and she says sure and tells me she's going to do that. A bit frustrating, but I'm not all that upset. Then it started happening almost every single weekend since that one. We have not been together outside of maybe a half hour after school at a time. I've been getting more and more irritated about it happening since then.

Here's where I finally stuck up for myself. We had made big plans to go on a hike and some other things after school yesterday. I was incredibly excited to finally actually spend a good amount of time with her after the long period of time without doing so. Then, yesterday, LITERALLY THE MORNING OF FRIDAY, she texts me and said she switched shifts with somebody so she doesn't have to work next wednesday and worked last night instead. Our plans were off, again. I wasn't mad at first, I asked if we could do something on wednesday instead, and she said she can't, as she's already made plans with somebody else. 

This morning, she asked me if we could be together tomorrow up until she has work. I said maybe, but that I didn't want to make the plans yet just in case she decides to cancel on me. I told her that if she wanted to do something with me tomorrow, she can call me in the morning when she wants to do something. This made her very upset. Am I the asshole for doing this?"

bvo24i	2019-06-01 18:44:01	indyguy46202	WIBTA for exposing a friend's lies, when the truth will hurt people and probably accomplish nothing?	"Several years ago, I met a man who quickly became a close friend and mentor. We bonded over swapping war stories (both being Navy vets), and he has been an incredibly positive and supportive influence in my social circle. He's always positive and kind, and he is well loved and respected.

According to his stories, he went to medical school, but dropped out and was accepted to the U.S. Naval Academy. He graduated and became a pilot, and served in Afghanistan, where he was shot down and briefly held by locals before being returned. His plane was later discontinued, and he was able to re-designate to cryptography. He earned a Master's in computer science, then a PhD in quantum computing. After he retired, he went into IT, worked for a local power company, but then struck out on his own with his own IT consulting business.

As you've probably gathered, it's almost entirely bullshit. I had a nagging feeling about him that I dismissed because I just liked the guy so much, and because he had been so sweet and lovable. But, I got to poking around recently and learned the following information:

He went to medical school and apparently became a physician's assistant, but I can find no evidence that he attended USNA or even served in the Navy. I did find court documents that indicate that he was convicted of several crimes (theft, forgery, dealing in a controlled substance) all related to having improperly used and distributed hydrocodone. In one case, his doctor was out of town and he phoned in his own prescription (he had undergone a small procedure), in the other, he offered medication to someone he had not examined, and had no authority to offer controlled medication.

He was then convicted of perjury and impersonating a public servant for claiming to the court that he was a formal Naval officer and pilot, which the court determined was untrue. It seems that he served some time in County jail for all of these crimes.

On top of all of that, I can find no record of a PhD, and it seems that his master's in Computer Science was granted by a pretty sketchy online school. Also, according to the Secretary of State's website, his business was dissolved last August. So I have no idea what he's doing for work, because he's acting as if his business is still alive and keeping him very busy.

I hope I'm wrong about all of this. But I'm not, unless there's another guy, born the same day, in the same town, with the same unusual name.

I have only shared this information with one other person, and she promised to keep it to herself. **My question is: Should I expose him?**

He is well loved, and incredibly kind and supportive. It will hurt a lot of people to find out that he lied about his entire life. As far as I know, he's done nothing to hurt me or anyone else. I can see no benefit to telling our friends about all of this, and I can see that it would create a rift between people who supported the liar and those who don't."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

bvnz5c	2019-06-01 18:35:52		AITA for reporting a ‘friend’ for benefit fraud?	"Okay so a few days ago I decided to report a relatively close friend because they have been exaggerating their illness quite significantly in order to claim over £500/month (PIP enhanced mobility and daily living for those of you in the UK). 

The problem is I have seen so many people, including close family members, get denied who do deserve it so I honestly felt it was the right thing to do but now I’m wondering if it was a bit of a dick move.

I understand exaggerating a little bit maybe but this was full on I can’t do anything for myself yet they don’t have or need carers or anything and I know from staying at their place that their housemates don’t do any of their personal care.

They also claim severe mobility issues but I have been a witness to them walking well over the limit for the benefit. 

I don’t think I’d mind if it was money they needed (even for bills etc) but they have no kids and I believe their parents still pay a lot of their bills and so seeing people not be able to afford disability supplies because of not being given PIP annoys me, especially as it’s taxpayer money. I still really like them as well, this wasn’t a bitter revenge type thing.

bvny69	2019-06-01 18:33:18	throwaway11250831	AITA for being frustrated with my boyfriends career?	Hi sorry I don’t usually post so forgive any mistakes or formatting please. So I’ve been with my boyfriend for 6 years, we took a break for one year a few years ago but we are back together now. I can’t totally disclose what his job is, but basically it’s secret and involves him traveling a lot. When we first met all he wanted to do was become (his job now). He worked very hard for years and finally got to a very good position. We are long distance - which is hard enough- but his job is so unpredictable. We often have to wait until the day before to book his ticket to come see me because he doesn’t know if he’ll be traveling that weekend. We end up spending triple the amount it should cost for a plane ticket if he had a more normal schedule. Last weekend for Memorial Day he was supposed to go to the beach with my friends and I as a double date. We booked the hotel and flights and literally the night before he tells me (once again) that he can’t make it because he has to travel for work. So I try to be understanding and move on. There was a chance that he would be sent abroad this weekend for work and he asked me to go. Of course we had to wait until the day before the trip to know  if his trip was actually happening. I then find out the trip was cancelled and when we tried to have him fly down to be w me this weekend, flights obviously were about $700 (instead of $150 usually). I had had a terrible day and once again I had tried to keep my schedule open just in case he could come down or we would go abroad. I told him I don’t feel like he appreciates how much I sacrifice for him. When he said “me too, this is hard on me too”, I said “I truly believe I sacrifice more in this relationship since the time we can see each other is so dependent on his work schedule”. He told me that I’m being selfish that I knew what I signed up for blah blah blah. It was a huge fight like our voices were raised... so I’m curious AITA?	No A-holes here	0	0

So I go to the door and DG1 was there, He gave me the 2 pizzas, a desert pizza, and 2 big sodas which was all prepayyed and left. I called my mom about it and she didn't order anything and drove home to see what was going on. We have had this happen before since we are living in a town house waiting for our house to be built. The pizza was dilevered 10 minutes ago so it was cold. All we could think of was call the pizza place and tell them. The conversation went like this.
'Hi this is M and we just got 2 pizzas, a desert pizza and two sodas that we didn't order.'
'Oh, I see... how long ago were these dilevered?'
'About 10 minutes, their getting cold.'
'Okay... well I guess enjoy the free pizzas and we'll dilever them to the right address.'
And we went on with our day, for about 10 minutes and then this happened. *knock* *knock*. See were this is going yet? Que DG2. 
'Hello, I was wondering if you guys had eaten any of the desert pizza and drink any of the pop because we didn't bring them.'
'We didn't drink one of the pops, so you can have that one.'
My mom comes comes upstairs to grab it from the fridge and goes back downstairs to DG2.
'Why did your son even grab the pizzas from DG1 in the first place?'
My mom had to tell him that I was young  and she had ordered pizza and forgets to tell us sometimes. And our neighbor was already pissed in the first place so forgetting half her order was not going to settle well. Now we have to tell our neighbor the whole story and not get her pissed at us for the last 3 weeks of us being here.

bvnvkm	2019-06-01 18:26:44	M1ssy-	AITA Welcome to Family Feud	"WITA - My Mom or My Aunt?

This happened between my mom and aunt and would like to have see what everyone says. So I’m curious what you all think. This happened about 2 years ago or so when we had a family get together since my uncle was visiting from the West Coast. Things were going great and everyone was having a good time. At the end of it all, my parents, myself, my aunt, and grandma were just chatting on the deck. I can’t really remember what my aunt said or my grandma’s response to it but it set my aunt off. She literally pushed my grandma and luckily I prevented here from falling over, hurting my foot in the process. After that altercation, the rest of the family left. As the days go by, my aunt literally went off on my grandma and sent a text to her. Now, my grandma isn’t tech savvy whatsoever so she never even opened the message until she asked my uncle to delete them for her. That’s when he saw the message that my aunt sent and showed my grandma. The message basically said that my grandma was dead to her and that she hated her. This hurt my grandma a lot. When she told my mom, my mom was fuming with rage. Now, it’s not an excuse for what my grandma said and she regrets saying it, but people of her generation can get carried away sometimes. My mom then sent a text back to my aunt, basically saying that what she was doing was down right stupid and should apologize to grandma. My aunt sent a message back saying that my mom is terrible and that she’s dead to her as well. My aunt then unfriended my mom and my dad who wasn’t involved in this whatsoever ever. My aunts husband also did the same thing. After a while, my grandma managed to have my aunt talk to her but all that came from it was insults. Then had the audacity of blaming my grandma for having too many kids and that her life would be better if she had stopped after she was born then she would get more stuff after my grandma passes away. My uncle was there to witness this and yelled at her to get out and that she had no right to say any of that. My aunt yet again says that my uncle was dead to her now too before leaving. Now, my mom has apologized to her but still firmly believes in what she had said since my aunt has pulled a lot of crap on my grandma before. To this day, my aunt refuses to talk to my mom unless they’re at a family function so she doesn’t look bad in front of the family. My mom just lets it go because it’s no use trying to get through to her.

Edit: A lot of you are asking and thinking back on the conversation, my aunt said something that my grandma thought was something stupid and outright told her that it was that. That’s what I can vaguely remember. And some said that I don’t know about my family’s childhood but when my aunt said things like what she said to my grandma about stop having kids after she was born is normal for my aunt is very much one of those entitled people. She said that because she has to share the inheritance with her other brothers and sisters when my grandparents pass away and she doesn’t like that."	Asshole	0	0

I just bought a brand new living room set a few weeks ago for our new home. I spent good money on it (for me) and want to keep it nice. 
Today we were talking about our plans for the day together. He was excited and ready to get going. I was finding a good break point on an art project before I got out of the chair. We are usually pretty silly together and joke with each other. He wanted me to get ready, whilst trotting around behind me, when he pulled his pants down and plopped his dick on the back of my chair. 
Okay it was kinda funny but I was pissed. I immediately started to “chase him down” when he ran away. It was no big deal to him. He’s done it before on our old couch to be “funny.”
Long story short, I got very angry when he denied me any sort of apology. I told him it was disrespectful and hurt my feelings. I genuinely wanted him to just say “I’m sorry” so we could go about our adventures for the day. He got ready real quick as I sat in frustration. He stood around for a bit across the room as I again asked for an apology. Again, he said it’s not disrespectful and not a big deal. I told him to “go ahead and get” already. I’m disappointed in him for not just saying sorry. I’m a pretty sensitive person. Wtf? AITA?"	Asshole	0	0
bvnsg7	2019-06-01 18:18:24	shhagsga-sc	AITA for wasting people’s time?	"I apologize in advance because this is going to be long. 
I am what you consider be a slow person. For example, when I am turning right on a red light I almost never do so and sometimes the cars behind me get mad and honk at me. I believe that it is better be careful than sorry. If I get into an accident it is going to take a lot more time than just waiting until it is clear to turn (maybe one hour versus a few minutes or even less). The next thing I do is that when there is a long line then I take a very long time when it is my turn. For example, I was watching baseball last week and there was a long line for the bathrooms. When it was finally my turn I took as much as long as I could. I did not try to be hasty. I even checked reddit while in the cubicle and flushed five times. In total this took less than twenty minutes but when I got out the people behind me (who were waiting to use the washroom) were very angry and gave me dirty looks. I just shrugged and told them that it is better be careful than to be sorry.  The next incident happened when I was camping with my friends. We were each supposed to do different tasks. For example, someone was  supposed to set up the tents. Someone was supposed to unpack everything and you get the idea. I was supposed to collect dry wood and someone else was supposed to use the wood to start a fire with the wood (when I came back with the dry wood). I went to look for the wood and I am a slow person and got distracted so it took me about 3 hours to find 5 pieces of wood. The majority of the time I was either on my phone or looking at the nature. I never looked for wood exclusively. When I returned my friends were very angry and cussing. They even got more angry because apparently five pieces of wood is not enough to start a fire and roast marshmallows (I highly doubt it). Then they had to find more dry wood themselves and when they returned they only cooked one marshmallow for me instead of 1.5. They said I did not do any work so I get the shorter end of the stick. I did not respond to their mean comments. The last incident is happening right now. I wasted your time by making you read all of that. My friends and family are mad at me (maybe that’s not true.

Weeks ago, I asked if I could draw on them before we toss them. Pretty much just because it could be a fun bonding activity w my family/friends and I like to draw. They said thatd be fine, sounds fun, okay whatever. Fast forward to today and they dont want me drawing on them because theyre going to use the counters between now and tomorrow night. Theyre moving all of the appliances off of it so that they can remove everything the night before we replace them, we would basically just be using them as a surface. I dont see how doodles would interfere with that. 

I think its sort of unreasonable that they said yes and then went back on it when my doodles wont get in the way of the functionality of the counter tops. Weve been bickering about it pretty much since I woke up because I asked if i could do it today and my mom started arguing with me. ""Why do you have to do this, why do you need to do it, I dont understand, we never said yes"" (They did. multiple times) ""Its just going to get in the way, I dont want to be out here with a bunch of drawings all over the counter, youre going to draw penises, etc"" (I told them I wouldnt draw penises as clearly they dont want that and they keep insisting Im going to)


And I can sort of understand where theyre coming from but whats the harm?

AITA; counter top is getting replaced and I want to draw on it. My parents said yes and are now saying no because of cosmetic reasons and that the doodles will get in their way for like, the day (at most) that theyll be there. It seems unreasonable to me."	Not enough info	0	0

I've been with my girlfriend 5 years. We've had the usual issues but nothing major and she's always been faithful. 

I started working nights 2 months ago. She began acting shady and I began to think she was up to no good when I was away at night. 
I asked her, she denied doing anything. 

I got to my wit's end and I set up a dormant camera on the laptop that's always in the bedroom and a voice recorder. When I got home, she'd left for work so I checked them. My stomach dropped when I saw/heard her on the phone on the recordings but then I realised that she was arranging a trip away with me and was ringing her relative abroad (hence the timing as time differences and shit) and was arranging to stay in their spare house. I've always wanted to go to her home country and she was arranging it for my 30th birthday and instructing her aunt on how to decorate the villa. 

She came home and I broke down and told her I was so sorry for doubting her. I told her I thought she was cheating but I'd left a recorder and knew what she was doing and I was ever so grateful. She then stormed out and said she can't believe I recorded her, that it's her flat and I invaded her privacy. She said she could've been doing anything, personal care, masturbating, whatever - things she wouldn't want someone to have recordings of. I apologised and said u knew it was crazy and I can't believe I ever doubted her. 

She slept on it and then told me to leave and cancelled the trip. i know I fucked up but I realised my mistake and apologised. It was a lapse in judgement but it gave me the piece of mind I needed. AITA?

**TL;DR** Recorded my gf whilst I was at work as I believed her to be cheating. Instead she was planning a secret vacation for my birthday. I was honest and apologised, she left me and cancelled the vacation."		1	0
bvnpk0	2019-06-01 18:10:31	madeuu	AITA for pissing my best friend off like this?	"  Ok so this story happened last night. A little background before I start this story. I have a good friend that moved from my state a while back, we will call this friend Alexis. Me and my friends here still talk to Alexis over text. However, I’ve been noticing that she has been changing a lot. For example, she claims that her personality is being a “bitch”. She also has a short temper with me and anything I say. Her personality has been changing because of her new friends. Alexis doesn’t let any of us(her old friends) follow or make any contact on social media with her new friends. We have gotten into many arguments before but this one is so stupid and blown out of proportion. Alexis has this one guy that she is into at her new school named Rob and this argument is lowkey about Rob.
     So last night Alexis was texting one of our mutuals that we will call Marissa (I don’t even want to start with all the arguments I’ve had with Marissa). Marissa   Accidentally brought the fact that she was secretly following Rob on Instagram. Alexis got pissed and Marissa ended up telling her the I follow him too. 
      After this, Alexis calls me and starts telling me to unfollow him. I said no because she gave no real reason to why I should.  Alexis ends up replying with the reason why she wasn’t me to unfollow him is because she doesn’t want Rob to think that she is talking about him to others. Me being a guy, I tell her that’s stupid because no guy would think like that so there is still no reason to un follow him. After this she says “Fuck you, you are an asshole, you’re not fucking loyal, Don’t fucking call me again!” And she hung up on me.
        So far she has blocked me on social media and was talking behind back to Marissa. Who was still following Rob at the time but Alexis didn’t even stay mad at her at all. Marissa called me to let me know that Alexis was mad at me and she had said that I’ve “changed”. Alexis was texting Marissa shitty things about me and kept telling Marissa to screenshot them and send them to me, I guess she wanted to get a reaction from me.
            It’s the next morning and I’m pretty indifferent to this situation, it’s just her making a big deal about it. I know this story sounds dumb but,I just want to know if I was being shitty by agitating her. So am I the asshole or is she the asshole??"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvnpgo	2019-06-01 18:10:16		AITA for lying to my gf?	"I really don't know what to do in this situation, so I have come to you, Reddit, for answers. Let me paint the picture for you. 

3 months ago I fell hopelessly in love with my gf. I truly love her with all of my heart. The troubles began a week ago. My gf went on a vacation with her family. During the time she was gone I really missed her. I felt like shit the whole time because she wasn't with me. So when I got invited to a party I figured I might as wel go to distract me from this feeling. 

On the party there was a girl, don't worry nothing major happened between us, she seemed really nice and reminded me of my gf. After a couple of drinks I basically started saying to her I really liked her and other flirtatious chatter. In the moment I didn't really think too clear about the situation. When I sobered up I realized what I had done. 

I feel fuxking terrible for saying those things to another girl than my gf. I wasn't sure whether or not I was going to tell my gf. Since she has gotten terribly sad over lesser things, such as giving too much attention to other girls.

bvnnqx	2019-06-01 18:05:45	AnonymousSeal	AITA for getting a job that might interfere with a future trip I committed to?	"My friend and I have been talking about taking a trip, just the two of us, to another country we really wanna visit. I was transparent about me possibly getting a new job that I'd have to take time off from for the trip, but at the time I didn't know for sure and was so excited about it that I said, ""yes, I'm committing to this trip no matter what!"" 

Now I actually DO have the job and taking a week off from a 2.5-month retail gig (going back to school) doesn't seem so ideal. It's not an important job career-wise but I've really needed some extra cash and structure in my life lately, so I really don't want to bail on the job (and go back to Lyft driving, which is what I do now). 
Also, after reassessing my finances, I feel less comfortable with the trip (pretty expensive) than I did when I committed.

We haven't planned the trip logistically yet, and my friend was really upset to hear that I'm nervous about not being able to take the time off since going alone isn't an option. I think my friend is truly angry with me, given that this was supposed to be our end-of-summer trip before going back to school. But I feel pushed into a corner like my only options are to work the job and skip the trip or take the trip and quit the job.

I know ITA for verbally committing to the trip without really thinking it through enough, but AITA for taking the job knowing we wanted to travel?"	Asshole	0	0

bvnn11	2019-06-01 18:03:54		AITA for ruining someone’s YouTube channel?	I was in a discord server with a friend that I have known for a few years... let’s call him Steve. Me and Steve both run small yt channels. In Steve’s discord server, he had so many rules in the server and I truthfully never really followed them. He got really angry at me specifically for breaking the rules when basically everyone was. For example, someone would come in the server and ping everyone tens of times and they would receive no punishment, but if I was making a joke and spammed, I would get a 7 hour mute. I called him out because it seemed hypocritical to me and he just got more and more angry. Then Steve started attacking my friends and was spreading rumors about them saying that we post hate comments on his videos or that I force them to donate to my channel. I invited some friends to the server to give evidence and disprove the rumors. At some (random) point it came up that my friend doesn’t have a dad. People in the server were making fun of him over it. I told Steve that making fun of someone for not having a dad crossed the line and Steve was saying that he didn’t care. He was also saying that it doesn’t affect him so it doesn’t matter. I was banned for trying to defend my friend. After this I noticed that my yt content started getting a consistent amount of dislikes and I assumed it was Steve and his friends. So, I got my friends to do the same and dislike all of Steve’s videos. He got about 40 dislikes (with only a few likes) and I noticed that he stopped posting content after the storm of dislikes.

&#x200B;

As a bit of context me and my Friend have been friends for nearly 2 years and its been a really spicy two years. My friend has many issues with her life such as Drunk mom, angry dad, Potential step-siblings and many other issues involving her personal life. This has been spread out for the course of 2 years now. So these issues have been going on for 10 full on years, even when i met her. 

&#x200B;

She has issues and whenever something goes down i try and take her mind off it by offering to buy her a drink to calm her nerves (an example) and shes like ""no! No! I dont want to, the issues need fixing"" and she says that all the time when she has a breakdown and I offer to help. There have even been times when she has said ""Yeah, our friendship cant work out so bye"" In the most random of times and Ive had to chase her down to give my reply. I even distanced myself for her for three months

&#x200B;

Well fast forward to two days ago, My friend refused to attend my Birthday Celebration and Yesterday I found out why. She was uncomfortable with the fact i was YOUNGER by 3 years, She always assumed i was older than her but i never told her my age. (Im Older than i look) 

&#x200B;

Well she screwed me over AGAIN, This is the third time and she said all the issues she has been saying for 3 years. ""Life is hard, I cant get a stable job, I have depression, Parental issues"" And i blew a fuse and got brutal; Gave her some live advice on how to deal with all these issues...

This morning, I get told that the plan has been moved up to anywhere from six months to a year since they believe that's how long it's going to take my grandmother to lose the house, seeing as we're pretty behind on a bunch of different bills.

bvnksw	2019-06-01 17:58:08	manweiler0525	AITA for eating the bride’s cupcake?	"First time poster, new to reddit, hoping I did it right this time. Sorry in advance. I just found out about this situation a few days ago and it’s been torturing me. 

So my husband and I got married almost 2 years ago. My little sister got engaged this year and is planning her wedding for next year. This obviously brings up conversations between my husband and I about our wedding. This week I was updating him about wedding progress and he mentioned that he wished the people who didn’t come to our wedding (spouses of people who came and we planned on both of them attending)  would have let us know they weren’t coming so we could have invited other people. He mentioned his cousin’s husband, and a friend’s wife who didn’t come. I asked why his friend’s wife didn’t come to the wedding when his friend did come, and he said, ‘Because you ate her cupcake at her wedding’.

Cupcakegate happened 3 years prior to our wedding. The bride was from another country. She came to the US for a semester abroad, fell in love with his friend, went home, and then came back on the K1 visa to get married so she could stay in the US. Their wedding was at his family’s house and there were only 8-10 people there, including the bride and groom. They had the ceremony in the backyard and had an iPad up to skype her family in from her home country. After the ceremony, we ate dinner in the backyard and then there were cupcakes for dessert. If I remember right, they were on a 3 tier display. I made sure not to eat any cupcakes from the top tier; assuming they were for the bride and groom. All of the cupcakes looked exactly the same, they bride and groom didn’t cut a cake or so any kind of ceremonious thing to get their cupcakes first. I was just told by his family to grab a cupcake for dessert. I grabbed one on a lower tier. Apparently it was HER cupcake. 

Part of me thinks that’s an absolutely ridiculous thing to hold a 3 year (5 years at this point) grudge over, but at the same time just the fact that she has held it this long makes me wonder if I really f’ed up. I would have never taken her cupcake on purpose and I wish she would have said something to me so I would have known and could have apologized. Apparently I ruined her wedding and had no idea.

bvnjto	2019-06-01 17:55:28	inked_bookworm	WIBTA if I (25F) asked my grandfather (75M) not to bring his new girlfriend (70sF) to my wedding?	"My grandmother (GM) was one of my best friends my entire life. Unfortunately, she had a lot of serious health problems so I spent my entire life unsure if each time I saw her would be the last. As I started to get older and things were getting serious with my now fiance, I began to get hopeful that she would at least be able to make it to my wedding. But, she died 2 years ago.

8 months later, my grandfather (GP) had a new girlfriend (NGF). It was a bit of a shock to everyone because it was so soon, but we didn't want him to be miserable and alone so we were supportive. The only thing that me and my first cousin (17F), who was just as close as I was to our GM, asked was for him to not bring her to our family Christmas that year. It was the first Christmas we were going to have after our GM died, and we weren't ready to see someone else sitting at her seat at the dinner table. It also would have been the first time we met NGF. He got really upset and refused to come to Christmas. It became a big fight with various people in the family taking sides. My mother and aunt (my cousin's mom) wanted us to ""be the bigger people"" but we were just grieving the first person we'd both ever lost and we weren't ready yet.

There have been a bunch of other issues surrounding her in the last 1+ year causing family-wide fights. I don't have space to go through them all but I'll give one example. A few weeks ago, my GP started having stroke symptoms so they rushed to the hospital. Luckily it wasn't a stroke, it was Bells palsy from his new hearing aid. The problem was that they thought he was potentially dying and NGF didn't call any of his family. We didn't find out until my mother saw him next and asked what happened to his face.

So basically I've only met her once, and she has been the topic of numerous family-wide fights. I'm having a hard enough time knowing my GM won't be at my wedding. I think that seeing a strange woman in her seat, especially after all that's happened in the past 1+ year is going to be too painful. All this time I've told my GP I have no problem with him having a girlfriend and I have no major problem with the woman herself. I just wanted to not be rushed into acting like she's part of the family when I haven't even come to terms with the loss of the actual part of the family. It's taking longer than it should have because he's been really disrespectful and rushing us with this big change. I don't think it's been resolved enough at this point and I don't want that lingering heartbreak to spoil a day when I'm supposed to be happy and focusing on my new husband. But, my GP would be really upset, possibly to the point of refusing to come, and I know some other family members would be displeased with me for causing problems.

bvnj14	2019-06-01 17:53:23	PM_ME_PICS_OF_PETS	AITA for getting a kid expelled?	"Two weeks ago on Friday, this kid posted a video on his private Snapchat story where he was yelling into the microphone about my friend “who wants to be a boy so bad” (as he said), and continued to yell about how he wanted to “cave their face in” and “take them around the corner and kick their fucking head off”.

I recorded the video from my phone using my laptop’s webcam (so he couldn’t see I recorded it), uploaded it as an unlisted video to YouTube, and sent the link to my friend that he was talking about. 

Over the weekend, my friend sent the link to other people from their town (we live in different towns) and from our school. By Monday, the guidance counselor was notified and the video had about 75 views. 

The counselor called me and my friend down and she basically asked me to tell her what happened, and my friend said that he was uncomfortable coming to school with him. The police were called and the kid got escorted out of the school, and the hate crime division from the department came and asked my friend if he was okay. 

Yesterday, I learned that the person who was screaming about wanting to beat my friend got expelled from school for being a “security threat”. He posted another story talking shit about me, and I messaged him on Instagram (I blocked him on SnapChat after I recorded the video, he was sent the link by somebody and found out it was me) and told him to at least talk about me to my face. He said that I’m a bully and he is going to go to the police. I basically just told him “good luck with that, want me to upload the video you just posted also?”, which he never answered and I blocked him on Instagram.

AITA here? I didn’t intend for the police to get involved or for him to be expelled, I just wanted my friend to know someone was talking about him behind his back.

bvngb9	2019-06-01 17:45:51	madsoki	WIBTA if I leaked a story to the press about a doctor at my dad's hospital?	"My mom told me something pretty disturbing about an obstetrician (pregnancy doctor) who is still practicing at the hospital that my dad works at. I'll call him Dr. J. My dad told her about it and she told me today and I don't understand how Dr. J is still practicing.

&#x200B;

About two and a half years ago, he got a DUI and then assaulted a nurse when she questioned his decision on a patient. He has since assaulted another nurse and the nurses who work with him report feeling scared to be around him. The most disturbing incident was when he was doing a procedure on a sedated woman and started talking about how he wanted to do things to her, specifically to her genitals that he was touching. A nurse reported him but he was still allowed to work. Then he showed up drunk to a procedure so they sent him to a psychiatrist, but being a small county he knew the guy and Dr. J was pronounced ready to work. He is no longer the head of the OB at the hospital but he is still seeing women and their babies, and still operating on women's genitals, even after his lewd and unacceptable behavior.

&#x200B;

I immediately wanted to protest outside the hospital to get Dr. J fired but that would put my dad in an awkward position. The nurses and doctors involved have to keep this confidential, and my mom probably shouldn't have told me, so I can't do anything that would connect me to this without getting my dad in trouble. But I have to do something. The women he's seeing should know what he's done before letting him operate on their reproductive organs. I can't believe he is still practicing.

&#x200B;

So I figured I'd email a local journalist and hope they'd break the story, which would hopefully either force Dr. J into retirement or make the hospital finally fire him. However, the hospital is quite small and services a large chunk of the rural county, and Dr. J is one of two obstetricians at the hospital. If he were fired there would be a single OB for all of the births in this section of the county, which is probably why he is still practicing. I don't know if the hospital isn't firing him because they don't want to go to the trouble of finding another OB or they actually can't find one, and I can't ask my dad without letting him know that I know about the situation, which I shouldn't, which would cause strife between him and my mom. 

&#x200B;

So would I be the asshole if I leaked this? I would be keeping a secret from my dad, which would suck, and I could endanger the people of the county by taking away one of their OB's. On the other hand, this man really shouldn't be practicing medicine and I don't know how he's still allowed to be in a position of authority over his female patients and nurses."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I pulled out the SD card and the SIM card.  I put the SIM card in an old phone and received a text message on the lost phone's number.  I texted the number and explained I found the phone.  They said their friend lost their phone a couple days ago and would see him tonight.  Great, so I figured we could plan a spot to meet and return the phone.

After a few texts, they stopped responding (it hasn't been very long - maybe an hour or two, but their first few texts were within minutes).  I figured I could check the SD card and see if I can find a picture with a name on it, and I did.  Through the pictures, I was able to find his Facebook profile, 100% sure.

So now I'm wondering if I should message him and let him know that I found his phone.  I'm sure he'll be happy to get his phone back, but the amount of ""detective work"" I did seems a little stalker-ish and I don't know if I should expect him to get angry about it.

"Two days ago, my 16 year old son came to my wife and I freaked out. He said he’s scared for his life and he doesn’t know what he’s going to do. We had to calm him down and to make a long story short, he thinks he got his girlfriend pregnant. He said she missed her period weeks ago and he doesn’t know what he’s going to do because he’s not ready to be a father. His girlfriend is vehemently pro-life, so there’s not anything he can do.

I asked him how could this happen; why wasn’t she taking her reproductive health seriously and be on birth control, and ESPECIALLY, why isn’t he especially not taking him reproductive seriously by using condoms. He said that his girlfriend’s parents are strict, so she has no way to access them, and to condoms, he said and I quote “Condoms feel like having sex with a thick garbage bag.” Apparently, they relied on the calendar method and pulling out because “together, it’s almost impossible to get pregnant.”

I was **infuriated**. I’ve talked to him ALL the time about safe sex. We’re no prudes; we knew that once he got a girlfriend, he’d start having sex. Which is why we emphasized being *safe*. We’ve just have had this conversation so many times; I was just so. Angry. That my son would do this to his life, and potentially wreck his entire life. 

I told him that this was his fuck-up, and he has to take responsibility. Effective immediately, he is going to have to get a job and work 40 hours a week and start building a savings. Additionally, he has shown that we cannot trust him to make responsible decisions, and he’s effectively grounded until the end of the year. He can spend time with his friends at our house only, with all the doors open, and he cannot go upstairs with any girl at all. He can also only do this only when we’re home (we live in a gated community so this is easily enforceable). That means no sleepovers, no parties, no going to the pool (unless we go with him), no nothing. If he wants to go somewhere like out to eat with his friends, we’ll use find my iPhone to track him. He said he understood.

He came to us today with great news; his girlfriend got her period. He asked now that she’s not really pregnant, can the punishment be less strict, and that he promises to start using condoms now, but my wife and I want to stick to our guns on this. Though with the added stipulation that he can work 20 hours a week instead, and it can be a mixture of volunteer and actual work. But he’s shown us he’s downright irresponsible and we just plainly cannot trust him until he matures. 

My son maintains that we’re being WAY to harsh, and that he realizes his mistake now, but he’s also said in the past that he’d never have sex without a condom because “he’s not an idiot.” We just plainly cannot trust him right now. Are we being unreasonable?

Now my stepfather asked me to make him a brand complete with business cards and all the other branded materials (sorry I don't know the names in English)... For free. 
I tried my best to refuse as kindly as possible, because my day job's pay sucks and working for free would mean stressing out my weekends as well as my weekdays.
I felt very bad and went to my mom for advice. Big mistake. She scolded me heavily, told me I could ""afford to be generous every once in a while"". I tried telling her how stressed I already am, how I'm burnt out on weekends but all she had to say was ""you can't be that tired, all I see you do on weekends is watch tv! Besides, you're just gonna have to draw him something, how is that gonna stress you?"" And basically guilt trip me endlessly until I accepted my stepfather's request. This ended up in a big fight and I had another stress induced breakdown.

My mother and I never really had a good relationship while I was growing up, and it got worse when my dad died when I was 13. My mom had always been kind of a narcissist, but after my dad passed she became an alcoholic and abusive to me (not physically, but verbally and mentally; an example would be her forcing me to look up the state of decomposition my father was in by the time he was found in his apartment). Anytime I tried to grieve for my father or express how I felt to her, I was reprimanded for expressing any emotions.  Eventually I stopped talking to her about anything in my personal life. My fiancé (whom I’ve been with since high school) was there to witness the worst of it and has never forgiven her for treating me the way she did. 

Ever since I moved out when I was 18, our relationship has gotten better although I am still wary about it. I’m an only child, so this will be her first grand baby and she’s extremely excited about it. But it’s gotten a little tricky. She wants to stay in our one bedroom apartment with us for two weeks before the baby is born, and she wants to stay for quite a while after. She says she wants to be able to help around the house. However, I’ll be making enough money to where my fiancé (husband by then) can be a stay at home dad like he wants to. I just don’t see where we’d need the help since he’ll be home. Also, we want the time after the baby is born to bond and figure things out on our own. I feel like either we’re going to clash, or her and my fiancé are going to clash (probably the latter). I’ve tried telling her a couple of days would be fine, but she seems offended by that. Everyone I’ve talked to says this is a bad idea.

He also has a long history of backing out, making excuses and disappearing for days any time we have plans to go somewhere or hang out. He blames work or falling asleep or forgetting. This is no exception apparently, because he's ditched me three times because of work or falling asleep since learning I was moving. I know he's going to reach out again but I'm honestly tired and hurt. I don't want to risk feeling hurt again, but I also feel very guilty about this because this might be the last chance for him to see me before I go.

I don't know if it'd make me the asshole, especially since lately he actually has reasons for ditching (sudden shift changes, not getting sleep and passing out after work). It's just that this has been a pattern for so long I don't really want to take another chance. WIBTA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Last year a group of 9 friends and myself (all 18-23 y/o) planned a trip together. We all paid for all our own things individually except for the airbnb. One girl paid and we all venmo-ed her, so money-wise everything was settled. We had plans to leave for the bus station at 9:30pm and at around 8:15pm one girl, Sarah, texts and says she’s not feeling well, she can’t come, but she wishes us a good trip. Then she texts and asks if it would be rude to ask us all to reimburse her for the cost of the airbnb. I told her bluntly that it would be rude, then followed up with an apology for coming off harshly but not taking back my confirmation that it would be rude. Sarah’s clearly disappointed but lets it go. Just kidding! The next day she texts the groupchat and says, basically, “i’ve been thinking about it and I think you should pay me. I‘m sick and I shouldn’t have to pay for other people’s airbnb.” (Not totally related but she posted snaps of herself at different places in the city we go to school in the next day.) A couple other people told her they weren’t going to pay her, and one guy sent a long text saying that it wasn’t our fault she couldn’t come, and that a few people wouldn’t have come at all if we hadn’t managed to find such cheap lodging once it was split. I was definitely the main person saying no though, both at the beginning to her (virtual) face and in reassuring others that they shouldn’t feel obligated to pay. She texts again after the trip is over saying we should pay her because she was sick in bed all weekend and didn’t go. I told her that we’d made a monetary commitment when we agreed to the trip and while I wasn’t going to pay her, that I sincerely hoped she got the chance to go to the same city and have a positive experience. She responded saying she’d never made a commitment and begging for us to pay her, and I left the group chat shortly after. I don’t think I owe her money, but I also went into it on principle before she even gave an amount she wanted from us. I’m asking if I’m the asshole because not only did I not pay her, but I basically ensured that the majority of the group didn’t either (the only two that did were her next door neighbor and someone who was actually close friends with her).

bvn7ro	2019-06-01 17:23:36	kckaaaate	AITA for charging my brother to babysit?	"Resubmitted because of character count!

So backstory: my brother has 3 kids, another on the way, and from the moment his first kid was born, he's 100% relied upon our parents - specifically our mom - financially. One of his kids lives full time with the kids mom, but our mom basically raised his second kid and became a full time child carer. My brother has lived with them off and on throughout the years, they pay for A LOT, etc. That never bothered me before, he was a single dad, I get it! However NOW, he met a woman, they had a kid (that they couldn't afford), they've moved in together, they both work, and now they're having ANOTHER because of bad family planning and not believing in abortion. When their 2 year old was born, my mom basically became full time caregiver to a newborn and his older kid when he wasn't in school. They get 100% free childcare, and it's absolutely running our mom ragged, causes TONS of fights between our parents, and now with the new one on the way it's basically unspoken that he expects our mom to watch their 2 year old, newborn, AND the eldest when he's not in school. They also routinely ask her to babysit or have sleepovers on weekends so they can do things like go to the movies, go to shows, or ""get some rest"". He gives her a couple hundred bucks every few months, but almost NEVER spoils her or does nice things for her. I've spoken with him SO MANY TIMES telling him that he should bend over backwards for her because she's saving them thousands a month, that he should be so grateful, that he's taking advantage of her because he knows she'll NEVER say no, and he always acknowledges that he knows what he's doing in the moment, and that he'll figure something else out, but nothing EVER changes.

&#x200B;

So, a few days ago he asks me if I can babysit their youngest so he or his wife don't have to take the day off of work while our mom takes his eldest to appointments all day. I say sure, but I see a teachable moment here: I'm self employed, my time is money. I'll only charge $10 an hour, so $60 for the day, and I didn't tell him, but I was just gonna give that $ to our mom. He says ""never mind"", and apparently is LIVID at me for having the nerve to charge him and making him have to take a day off of work. I take my nieces and nephews ALL THE TIME - we do sleepovers, we go cool places, etc, but he's asking me to give him free childcare so HE can make money, making it so I can't work all day, JUST like he takes advantage of our mom? I explain it as such - childcare usually isn't free, and this is reality - treat mom better and maybe I wouldn't be trying to drive this point home.

bvn7fm	2019-06-01 17:22:44	CHAD_J_THUNDERCOCK	WIBTA if I start asking for a £20 deposit from a flakey friend?	"I cut her out of my life 18 months ago as she flaked 9 times in a row. She often flakes 10 minutes before we are supposed to meet. She often would ghost then come back weeks later asking to meet up like nothing happened. If we plan something months in advance she will still flake. Sometimes she messages that she is free and nearby, out of the blue, I reply we can get coffee quick within 20 minutes and she says she already is on a train to somewhere else and she messaged me while boarding it. She sometimes turns up 90 minutes late to a quick drink and is furious that I didn't wait around. 

She is notorious for double and triple booking on people and picking the funnest or more convenient option in the moment. 

Call me a sucker but she did every trick in the book to get to 9 in a row. We kept upping the ante until it became I never would see her again if she flaked, and she flaked. 

We had serious sit down conversations and discussed it multiple times. I used negotiation, persuasion, DEARMAN and so on to try to convince her its not in her interests to do it to people long term. To tell the truth she hurt me. 

She came to my house crying and pleading for forgiveness after no contact for 12 months. I thought about it a while and forgave her and she's been good for 6 months.

This week she flaked at the last minute 2 times. One of her reasons was fair, but she didn't really apologise for either, and it didn't need to be the last second she flaked for either instance. I could have done other things and it messed me around. We made plans for Sunday tomorrow on her request. But now she has not responded in days about what time its happening and somehow I'm supposed to chase her and convince her to hang out when she suggested it. I'm scratching my head at how I let it get to this point again.

I love spending time with her when I'm with her. We have a rich history and she is nearly irreplaceable as a friend. Neither of us have any interest in dating each other btw. I don't want to never see her again though it's a price im willing to pay to minimise pain. In the early stages of dating you expect this kind of power game behaviour; not a friendship of 10 years.

I propose she wires me a £20 deposit when we organise something. If she turns up she gets it back immediately. If she refuses then I will say clearly she puts low odds on turning up. If £20 is too much of a risk for her as something better might come along then don't make plans in the first place. We somehow spent 1 hour organising to meet up for just an hour this week and it never happened. The ideal case is I never make £20 from her. 

I've drifted away from a lot of friends for different reasons and don't want to lose more. My conflict resolution skills are not optimal. I want to fix problems not give up. 

I think she might refuse the deposit idea in principle and we stop hanging out completely. 

I've not done this yet and wanted to A/B test the idea here."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

Today I decided to remove K as we don’t talk much and I have a girl that I’m happily involved with. She texted me this after she figured out I unadded her:

“Hey ____. I sent you a chat on snap a little bit ago saying I’m home from vacation and when you’re free we can hang out. I noticed that it wouldn’t send because you blocked me or unadded me. I thought we were good so it was a little surprising but just wanted to text you that next time you do that to someone you might want to give them a heads up or explain why to them otherwise it’s kind of a “dick” move on your part and a little hurtful to the person your doing it to :) but oh well you already did it.

But first I should perhaps give some context so when I was 14 my parents divorced and I was heartbroken , I cried I suffered , but my parents never tried to enforce a custody order /anything of the sort , my mother moved out to Canada and I could be with her or my dad whenever I pleased  (Albeit I had to say in advance that I’d like to go to my mother or stay with my father ) that was quite reasonable I guess I mostly wanted to remain impartial in this . Then a few months after the divorce I met my stepmother she was one of the most caring and  nicest people I’ve ever met same for her 2 daughters (age 6 and 8 then) we got along really well and after a while she started treating me as if I was one of her own children , she really loved me and she probably still does , I loved her and her kids too and everything was generally great until a few days ago when I found who my “mommy” really was she was my fathers mistress , this woman lied to me and I loved her , something in me snapped and I told my father to either get rid of her and my “sisters”within the next 2 days or I’ll move out to my mother in Canada and he or his “wife” will never see me again . And whilst he hasn’t given me a concrete response yet it seems like hell just divorce her and I’ll never have to see her again . I personally do feel rather horrible as I saw her crying her eyes out , she literally came into my room and asked me if I hate her this much and tried telling me that she loves me and other such things. Again I’m sorry if I broke any rules (based on what I’ve read I haven’t ) , please feel free to correct me as I generally am new to reddit and just wanted to ask for judgement whether I should feel horrible or not so AITA?

His response was that ""death comes in 3s so this is number 2"".

I told him that was one of the meanest things he's ever said, because why would you tell someone that is grieving to get ready for more.

He thinks I'm overreacting because he didn't mean to be cruel it just slipped out because he wasn't paying attention to what I was saying because he was busy getting dressed to go out. I feel like that makes it worse.

So I just want to know if I'm overreacting and being an asshole or if he's inconsiderate and being an asshole.

"Last night I (19F) was at a club concert with a small group of friends and I finally felt genuinely good, without having to drink a lot in order to open my mouth or to dance without thinking what others believe. I struggle with anxiety and depression, so these happy moments are somewhat rare for me, but I honestly thought it was a wonderful evening and I was full of energy, even though I have some serious sleep problems. 

After that, one of my friends invited me to come over and stay overnight at her apartment - I said why not. I was still feeling good, so that I wholeheartedly accepted that one of her friends (a girl that I barely know, but she seems a nice person) would come as well. We were supposed to have a night only for us, just like other girls do. 

As soon as she arrived at around 3 am, she started to talk about her actual relationship and how unhappy she was with that guy. I listened to what she was telling and I tried to give her some pieces of advice, but I easily got bored because that was the only topic both of them were discussing. 

After one hour of mindlessly scrolling through my feeds because I had no other thing to do, I stood up and said that I want to call a taxi and go home. I apologized and I said that I wasn’t really feeling good. The girl whose apartment we were in told me that she felt bad that I didn’t enjoy myself and she seemed honest.

I am not particularly close to my stepdad, so I'm not very close to anybody on his side of the family either. Also apologies if Reddit mobile butchers the formatting of this) 

My aunt and her kids come in to town pretty often, and while they are in town they usually stay in our house. That doesn't bother me because I tend to keep to myself anyway, no big deal. 
My only problem is that she just really seems not to like me?? I can't verify that because I don't talk to her very often, but more often than not it seems like she'd rather be talking to any of my siblings rather than me. 
When she comes in to town, she always brings my siblings gifts, but never me (this is whatever, but I thought worth pointing out) including for Christmas, when she bought both of my siblings fairly large gifts, and seemingly just didn't bother with me. When I graduated from high school 2 years back I invited her and her kids to a family get together, and she didn't respond at all. 
At first I thought maybe it was my fault because I'm not very social and outgoing like her and her kids, and she might have taken it the wrong way, but I have made multiple attempts to include her in my life or get to know her and it never goes anywhere. 
I thought maybe it was because she is religious and I'm not, as well as being lgbt, but there's no way she would know that, so I don't think that's it. So,

bvmwmf	2019-06-01 16:55:26	Pianaman	AITA for causing a fuss? (British etiquette question)	"Right, so this happened a couple hours ago. I'll try to be impartial in my writing. Also going by appearances the couple in this story looked like reddit-types, so if you're reading this a) no offense was intended and b) your cat was very well-behaved. 

**Setting**: A London residential block about three-quarters of the way through gentrification. On the corner, we find a café with a clever name and expensive nibbles. It's a beautiful Saturday morning, rapidly approaching noon. The café is small and quite busy. Most tables are young families enjoying a mimosa-touched brunch. Everyone is blandly attractive in that J Crew/university handbook kind of way. Despite the crowd and the intimate space, conversation is kept mostly to a murmur (rule of thumb: the English talk in stage whisper until they get to the pub). I am on my own, tucked in a corner, reading a book.

**Event**: Three people take a nearby table: A young (mid-twenties) English couple take a table next to me, along with what seems to be an acquaintance of theirs, a *very* energetic  woman in her thirties, whose accent and demeanor imply a Latin background. The younger woman also has a pet carrier, from which she extracts a handsome ginger tomcat who curls up under her chair. The cat is leashed and shall no longer appear in this story, but I felt him remarkable enough to mention.

Having placed their order, the older woman then launches into her life story, including describing in matter-of-fact detail moments of childhood abuse. She is neither self-pitying nor dramatic. She is also very, very loud, to the point that the surrounding tables (myself included) are held hostage to her tale -- which winds up concluding with her current romantic preferences.
While not excessively graphic, it was quite personal, and honestly not the sort of thing anyone really wanted to hear from a stranger -- evidenced by the many looks shot their way by not only myself but all the other tables around them.  

Unable to read my book, I get up to pay my bill and leave. On the way out, I pause by the table and tell the woman that she was ""being quite loud and disrupting the people around her."" I was of course annoyed, but hoping that my tone was more informative than adversarial. All three were caught very much by surprise, and after a moment the young woman said that I was ""incredibly rude"" whilst her boyfriend looked like he'd been slapped. The older woman herself said nothing and looked away.  
I'm approaching a character limit so to cut the rest of it short, no cinematic fisticuffs or anything, although there was an awkward moment when they queued up behind me to pay their own bill.  
I'm looking for your thoughts on this because I'm from an American city where calling others out for bad public behavior is pretty normal, and I myself have benefited from strangers calling me out. Did the mortal sin of ""causing a fuss"" outweigh good intentions?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

They got me into a *very* decent mining pool. Stepped me through what I could do to turn my shoddy laptop into a usable mining device and they paid me in small increments of bitcoin for editing crap they had written in English but had gotten things like past/present/future tenses and plural/singulars of nouns wrong.  


Through 2011 to 2013 I had mined, been paid, and otherwise collected a total 138 bitcoin. Mid 2013 said uncle smashed my mining pc ""because I was always on it""(False.

I had initially started mining as a spite investment(not the part I want to be judged on, I ***know*** this part of it is at least vaguely asshole-y) due to the fact my GF in 2011 left me and I had 300-ish bucks spare I was planning to blow on an end of highschool thing for her and I. After that the plan then became to start mining in 2011, use the 300-ish bucks to convert my lappy into a usable miner, ignore what bitcoin is/was worth until Nov 25 2017. This was the 6th year anniversary of when I started mining, cause I had been looking for a long term romantic relationship since I was 11 right up until I was 17( 2005-2011), 6 years of mining to match the 6 years I wasted dating around, finding semi-serious relationships that just ended in heartache etc.

She's also super super tight with money, used to splitwise me down to pennies (which is fine but I wasn't so anal about charging for shared house stuff).

2 months after moving out I get a call from old housing agent asking for address cos he wanted to send me a letter. Happily gave it (naively) and he hesitated and said the landlord wants to take us to court cos she hasn't received last 2 months rent. I was FURIOUS because I know I sent it to Mortal Enemy.

The reason why this is unbelievable to me is because this person is the tightest and most calculating with money I have ever known.

Anyway I get no apology no explanation - for what is basically theft from me and the landlord, as well as potentially ruining my future mortgage application (here they need references from past landlords).

Pregnant friend knows how I feel about this person and they say oh you should speak to her, I'm sure it was a mistake, and constantly meets her etc. She knows how I feel about this person and genuinely while it angers me that she is oblivious to all this I am also in NO mood to go to her baby shower when this person will be there. It will just ruin my mood and I don't want to get into a potential shouting match at a joyful occasion.

My husband says I would be TA if I don't go cos pregnant friend is a decent friend of mine, and I get it that I'm being petty and consumed with anger but I just do NOT want to see this person's face. Suggestions of ""go and avoid her"" won't work, it's only around 15 people and not a big space, if anything by openly ignoring her I will be drawing attention to it."		1	0
bvmrgd	2019-06-01 16:42:47		AITA for telling my boyfriend to leave after he made me piss my pants?	"Some background, my boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. We are both aware of each other’s “traits”. For example, he has this thing where he HAS to be listened to and if he notices you’re not he’ll almost force himself to be your attention. This comes from being the youngest child in his family and constantly being overlooked growing up. 

Now me, embarrassingly enough... since I was young I’ve had this horrible thing happen where I pee my pants easily when I laugh too hard. It’s awful, it’s embarrassing, and I’ve tried everything to prevent this. I was bullied horribly (and understandably) growing up. My boyfriend is aware of this. Now that I am older (24) it RARELY happens, probably only once a year. 

Last night my boyfriend was over and we were joking around and having a great time, literally cracking ourselves up. At this point we were in the kitchen dancing to that stupid “La Beep” Spanish song when he cracked some hilarious joke and I started laughing. I could feel myself having to use the bathroom so I tried to push myself away to get to the toilet but he kept pulling me towards him so he could finish his joke. I struggled more and said under laugher “you’re going to make me pee myself” but he kept going. I finally made it to the bathroom BUT HE FORCED THE DOOR OPEN because he wasn’t done adding to his joke. At this point it was too much and I peed myself.

On the bathroom floor with the door finally closed I SCREAMED at him to leave. I was humiliated and sobbing (he thought I was laughing). Wetting myself brings back these awful memories of elementary, middle and high school and I was just so upset. My boyfriend apologized and brought me clean clothes but I was just so mad that he literally kept me hostage while I pissed myself.

bvmrbl	2019-06-01 16:42:27	New_Honeydew	"AITA for saying asexual people don't have to ""come out""?"	One of my coworkers came in today with a flag pin on her shirt. I asked about it at lunch since I didn't recognize the flag and she told me it was the asexual pride flag and she was wearing it in honor of pride month. I know the basics of asexuality (people who aren't sexually attracted to anyone), but I don't know a lot more about that. I asked her if asexuality is really considered part of the LGBT community since not being attracted to anyone isn't the same as being attracted to the same sex. She told me asexual people are definitely part of the community and while they don't face all the same struggles as other LGBT people, they still have to face discrimination and come out as well. I asked if coming out is really necessary since people generally don't care who is or isn't having sex and it's honestly kind of too much information. I really believe there's no reason for an asexual person to tell people who aren't their partners that they're asexual; it's a little weird going around telling people you don't want to have sex. She got annoyed at me and told me it's more complicated than that and she didn't want to get into it more, then she left to go back to her desk. My girlfriend said later that I was kind of a dick, but I don't think I did anything wrong just by asking a few questions. AITA?	Asshole	0	0
bvmr44	2019-06-01 16:41:54	sandcaste	AITA for being upset with my mom for allowing a stranger to sleep in my bed while I was away for the night?	"Here’s some background. I (16f) spend a lot of time in my room. As a result, I have a LOT of private stuff in there. Ive struggled with depression for a large portion of my life and ive decorated my walls with a lot of things to try and attempt to make me feel better when I’m down. I have pictures of my estranged father, little notes, affirmations, personal thoughts etc. A lot of stuff that I’m not too keen on having complete strangers see. Anyways, I left my house yesterday to stay the night at my best friend’s, and I come home this morning to find some dude in my bed. Apparently this guy is a family friend, and rather than using the mattress we have for this exact reason, my mom put him in my room. I’m generally a pretty private person, so obviously I get upset as all hell. I try to keep calm but I express my distress about the situation. My mom does not care. She acts like I’m the bad guy here, says that I’m a bitch and need to learn to be kind and gracious. As if she didn’t put a grown ass man in her 16 year olds room. Obviously I’m biased, but that’s why I’m here. Am I the asshole for being mad that she put a random dude in my room which holds my private belongings?

bvmquf	2019-06-01 16:41:11		AITA for letting my brother get caught shoplifting and possibly ruining his career?	"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I’m a 17 year old female, just graduated high school and headed to university in the fall. My brother is 24 years old and was just accepted to medical school this April after applying once unsuccessfully. The whole family was ecstatic about the whole thing because it’s been his dream and he’s worked really hard for this. Getting to the important part: 

My brother is an adrenaline junkie and has been doing dangerous things all his life. Ever since he was little, he would steal little things and bring them home. For the past few years, he’s been taking advantage of target’s shitty self checkout services and basically shoplifting stuff. A year ago he came home with a kurieg (coffee machine) and comes back with clothes, a shit ton of groceries when his receipt says he spent $20. My parents have no idea, just myself and my siblings and his girlfriend. 

2 weeks ago we went to target to get some groceries and a couple shelves. He, of course, stacked the cart with clothes, shoes, ect. When we got to checkout, he told me what he was gonna do so I was just like okay whatever you wanna do. He looked really nervous though because this target was one we hadn’t been to before, him and his girlfriend bickered at the self checkout stand and then left without paying. I asked them what happened and they said there was a worker watching them so they would walk around the store a bit before checking out. They stopped by the bathrooms and whispered to eachother and I noticed a man in a batman t-shirt suspiciously walking by us several times. I observed him for a bit and saw he was walking to self checkout, talking to a family, and then the family walked out and he did not. I knew then, he was a secret security. There are security/employees that dress normally and walk around looking for shoplifters. I told my brother I didn’t feel good about this and he shouldn’t do it. He told me not to worry. 

Long story short here, he got caught. Him and his gf got caught walking out of the store by the man in the batman shirt (I went to the bathroom because I honestly didn’t want to be there while they did what they were gonna do). They pleaded with the security and said they could pay for everything but target called the police. My brother now has a misdemeanor on his record and he has to report it. I’m pretty sure he’s going to have his acceptance taken away and won’t be able to apply again. 

I told my mom that I knew there was a secret shopper and she was furious that I didn’t tell him or say anything. Now I’m spending my summer trying to figure out solutions for my brother. I feel like an asshole for not telling him but I didn’t know 100% and he was so sure of himself. So, Am I really the asshole here?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bvmpvu	2019-06-01 16:38:42	xMistful	AITA for ignoring my grandma?	"A bit of context before getting to the point: my grandma is a very conservative person, and overall toxic. I've lived with her since I was born, and she always criticizes everything I like, everything I do, and everything I say. She also controls every single thing I do (I'm 18, turning 19 this year) 

Yesterday, we were going out to check out some dresses for a wedding in August, and I got all ready, waited in kitchen for her. When she saw me, she started screaming at me and saying that my shorts were '' too short'' and I shouldn't complain if some man takes advantage of me. I went back to my bedroom, and changed to some pants, to avoid more conflict, but she wasn't satisfied. She noticed I was wearing my favorite sandals, that for some reason she hates, and commanded me to wear some fancy shoes that I hate. That was the tip of the iceberg for me, so I just sat there and refused to take the sandals off. She started screaming at me, and threatened '' We're not going out if you don't take them off! '' And I didn't, so she went back to bed to watch TV.

So, today she was watching TV in the kitchen, I went there to get a glass of water, and I noticed that she messed up with the TV, the image was terrible. So I picked the controller, fixed it, and again she started screaming at me, accusing me of ruining it, and saying that '' it looked better before '' and that I '' screw up everything ''. Fast forward a few hours, I went back to the kitchen, made a snack for me, and completely ignored her, because I was mad (I still am). When I finished eating, I ran to the toilet cause I really needed to pee, and she just assumed that I wasn't going to make a snack for her. So grandma started saying that I'm a monster, that I have no feelings, that I don't care about her, etc etc. After that, I lashed out and told her that after what she said, I wouldn't make the snack for her. 

And no, she's not incapacitated whatsoever, she can perfectly stand up and make her own snack, like she does every day when I'm not home. 

She's still talking to herself about how bad of a person I am, I can still hear her. So AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

This morning I had to do some final chores before I leave for boot camp tomorrow, and the first thing on my list was to put some gas in my car. The cashier wasn’t available as I went in to the station because one of the workers was cleaning the carpet in front of the counter. I decided to wait a few steps back to give the worker space, and I was positioned in a mini aisle in the station. As the cleaner got up a woman in her 50s or 60s walked up to pay for her coffee. I decided to say “Oh, I was here first”. No one seemed upset at the moment, so I paid for my fuel and went to the bank. As I get out of the bank the lady from the gas station is there and says “we meet again”. I thought it was the same lady, but asked her to clarify and turns out it was. She proceeded to say that “what you did was rude”, and I said “I fail to see how thats rude”. She went on saying it was rude to cut off a woman who was probably the same age as my mother. As she turned around I said “have a nice day, miss”, which she had no response to. Am I the asshole?

My father was sentenced to a long time in prison (I think like 123 years in total for over 60 offences), basically life. 
He was 43 when I was born and is now 65. 
Apparently (according to mods on here) I'm not allowed to state the reason why he was sent to prison, due to it being triggering which I understand. 

But he was an awful man. 

I never met him and 3 weeks ago he was transferred to hospital to die whilst still in the custody of HMP.

I received a message, begging me to visit him before he died. He told me he loved me and he was sorry and he wanted to tell me the truth. 

Everyone told me he may be an awful man but he loved me, I'm his daughter and I should go or I'd always regret it. I drove to the prison and looked at a photo of him to know what he looks like as I had no idea really. Everyone I looked at his face I could only imagine his victims, their pain and trauma. It took me back to years of self loathing and punishment for his crimes. I hated myself for so long. I turned around and drove home. 

2 days later he died and his family and some of mine are saying I made a huge mistake and how could I not visit my own father for his last wish. 

Was I the asshole? I can't stop thinking about it.

bvmnqu	2019-06-01 16:33:05	In_a_box_	AITA for not wanting anything to do with my future in laws?	I am 26F and my fiance is 27M and we have been together for 2 and half years. Last year my fiance got offered a job by his cousin. His cousin got a DUI, his license suspended, and needed someone to drive the company truck. My fiance already had a job in landscaping and had plans to make more of a career out of it (getting his Osha 10, and other certifications). My fiance always wants to help others and thought it would be a better job for him so he quit his landscaping job, and helped his cousin out. His cousin is a control freak and giving him nothing but grief at work. In November after his cousin got his license back he fired my fiance. This caused a crazy amount of grief on our relationship. My student loans went into repayment and I was left paying all the bills. For three months I paid over 1200 in bills on minimum wage. It took my fiance 6 months before he found a job again. During that time none of his family once checked on us to see if we were okay. Instead they sided with his cousin, and explained it isnt easy working with family to my fiance. I am floored. I feel like his family doesn't care about him. Since than I have made every effort not to see his family. I always pick up an extra shift even though I don't have too. My fiance says it makes him feel lonely. But I can't bring myself to go.	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I woke up this morning to the girl and the 7-year-old gone. I sent my daughter to the park a few blocks away to get them, and they returned half an hour later, saying that they had not only went to the park, but wandered around looking for garage sales, and walked to the grocery store that is almost 2 miles away and is located on a busy highway. 

I might be a little strict, but I don't let my daughter go anywhere that far without someone with her, and definitely without me knowing where she is. So I told the two kids they would have to go home. When I called the girl's parents, they were immediately angry, with Dad on the phone saying ""well we kept *your* daughter (the night before), but okay"", and Mom in the background shouting about how I was a bitch and was kicking a child out of my house. When they showed up to pick up the girl, Mom shouted up to my apartment that the girl was never allowed back here, called me a bitch, told my daughter ""your mom can fuck off"", and then peeled away.

Now I'm doubting whether I was right in sending them home or not, and if I deserved the cussing out. Should I have kept them here and punished them myself? Should I not have punished them at all? Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

So there was this girl that started talking to me over Instagram, and I knew her from a couple classes at my school.  
We start talking and then after we get to know each other better we start video chatting more and then finally the day comes, when she admits that she likes me. Now I admit that I like her back, but I didn’t like her the most out of the people I liked. So we talk more and then she invites me on a trip to an amusement park, to where I accept and we go. I had a good time, we had some fun, but then the drama starts. 

EVERYBODY is talking about the trip we had and the only way I can tell is if she told other people then they spread the word, because I sure hella didn’t. It makes me wildly uncomfortable and I start to lose a little interest in her because of all this drama and my insecurity adding on to it.

So a while later she asks me truth or dare, and I say truth, wanting to start out easy. Then she asks me, “Who do you like?” And me being honest there said someone else. She seems okay with it and plays along but then ALL OF A SUDDEN she FREAKS OUT and starts saying “all of that was for nothing” and “you never really liked me in the first place.”
I try to calm her down over video chat and tell her that that isn’t true, that I did like her in the first place, but that I’ve kinda lost interest in her from all the things that have happened.

She was crying a lot and we finally get things sorted out a little while later, but AITA for telling her I liked somebody else after she supposedly spread word about us and made me wildly uncomfortable?

TL;DR : Me and a girl go on a trip together, word gets around about it and makes me super uncomfortable, I admit to liking somebody else after she asked."	Asshole	1	0
bvmk3e	2019-06-01 16:23:27	Derpiona	WIBTA if I slowly stopped supporting my struggling girlfriend?	"I'm 27 in low paying job and as the days go by the more depressed I get as my peers pass me by - I never finished University and dropped out after my second year - I tried again for another year but had to quit yet again.

I met my girlfriend 6 years ago - she used to be very outgoing but never had a stable career due to her ill health with severe bouts of asthma as well has having a blood borne disease that have landed her in hospital over the many times that we've been together.

3 years ago her sisters asked her to help take care of their mother (suffering from dementia) but after a while they kicked her out for doing ""a good enough job"" and because of this she lost her disability benefits. She has absolutely no help from family.

As of recent her health as been better and she's been cycling quite a bit - one of her old friends suggested for her to get a part time job and she lost it and had a dreadful depressive episode...

I've been supporting her for the 3 years ever since where I am now living paycheck to paycheck as is she - my aspirations for my future are fading quickly and this is causing me to fall in to a deep depression. I want to go back to earn a degree or any form of further education/training in order to make a better future for myself ...I cannot get any financial help and I cannot save enough to go back. If I do apply for any further education/training my wages would far lower than they are now and i'd fail to support the both of us.

I won't cut off all financial help - but I've been thinking that maybe she needs to get a part time job and maybe we can both move forward - but her recent reaction when her friend suggested the same thing, has forced me to think twice, as I know she struggles really hard herself.

I cooked dinner for myself the other day and was really proud of it, and I asked if he wanted to try a little bit (literally just a bite) because I wanted to know his opinion on how it tastes; it's not as good when it's only you trying it.

bvmizz	2019-06-01 16:20:39		WIBTA if I told my friend his mild Klonopin/alcohol use could lead down a path of addiction?	"*Background:* He's 25/M and I'm 27/F. We've known each other for three years. I have unrequited feelings for him, but was rejected two years ago since. The feelings never went away, but I deal with them. My unrequited feelings might be clouding my judgement and making me way more concerned than I should be.

*Story:* My friend and I hang out a lot, maybe five out of seven days a week. This week, he was running out of 0.5mg Klonopin (the smallest dose) and had to go a few days cold turkey. As it was leaving his system, he was returning to the person I remembered becoming friends with in the beginning. He was more open and emotional. I never realized that the Klonopin was making him so...closed off. He also let me know that he could not function and would have to miss work if he didn't get his Klonopin. Withdrawal gives him headaches, dark thoughts, and general ill feelings.

He also starting acting...very interestingly during this withdrawal period. I won't explain everything, but when I told my co-workers and other friends the things he was saying to me, they were convinced he was in love with me. I'm still convinced he's in love with his ex, but I digress. I wouldn't enter a relationship with him, because I think he's headed down a dark path I want nothing to do with.

During that period, he told me that when he drinks alcohol, it makes him ""shell up"", as in he becomes less able to be vulnerable or open to people. When we first met in school, we kind of became close because we were two of the three people in the program who didn't drink and it's rare to find people our age who didn't drink. I still don't drink (it causes horrible depression in me for whatever reason), but I don't care if people do. When I ask him why he decided to drink a beer...at home..when I'm only around...he has no answer and says how much he hates the taste. Then I started realizing he drinks almost every time I came over, as if he's using alcohol to ""shell up"" around me.

If you don't know, you're not really supposed to mix Klonopin with alcohol. But he takes the lowest dose for a sleep disorder a few hours before bed and only drinks one serving of alcohol. Apparently, it helps him sleep even more deeply, but I feel like this is a terrible reason to mix a medication and alcohol. And I feel like when the small Klonopin dose isn't as effective, he's going to need more. Then he's going to turn one beer into two. Two into three.

Last night, he went back on Klonopin and washed it down with a large beer. I'm guessing it was a two serving can? And once again, he became a boring, closed off person that was depressing to be around. Of course, my mind immediately thinks he's drinking to ""shell up"" around me.

I think he needs an intervention before it gets out of hand. He says his family would kill him if they found out and I'm almost to the point that I would find a family member on Facebook and tell them. I would threaten it to his face if I had to."		1	0

My (F24) birthday was last week. My partner (M26) was traveling for work and got home around 10PM on my birthday. He wanted to save my birthday festivities for this weekend so we had more time.

Last week I had posted an Amazon wish list for some friends who wanted to send me birthday gifts. My partner also had access to this list. 

Last night I received some gifts in the mail from friends and decided to open them because... it’s my birthday (well, it was a week ago). I opened one in front of my partner. It was a fabulous gift! Just what I wanted. My partner was clearly upset. He told me it was a duplicate of what he got me. I said something along the lines of, “Oh no! Well we can return this one or you can return yours and save some money. You choose!” He told me not to open any more gifts until he gave me his. I don’t recall how I responded, but it wasn’t agreeing to that. 

This AM I woke up very early because I wasn’t feeling well and my partner was still asleep. I opened the other gifts. I wasn’t sneaky about it or anything — threw the packaging out but put the gifts on the counter. My partner saw it later this morning and is so upset. “I told you not to open the gifts until you opened mine!”

He is allowed to feel however he wants to feel, but I don’t think I should feel like the asshole. My thinking is that these are gifts for ME sent from MY friends for MY birthday that was LAST week. I feel like he’s being a little bit childish. I understand he put thought and effort into my birthday but I don’t see how opening other gifts first takes away from his hard work.

bvmf7j	2019-06-01 16:11:04	Jonathan-Earl	AITA for arguing with my ‘boss’ because I have way more experience than him?	So a little back story, the job I work at is a security fence company. I’ve been working there for 3 years, and we rotated a lot of people out to the point I had the most seniority by a long shot. So I was given a supervisor role, had it for a bit before I got sick. I’ve been sick now for close to 7 months, and I lost my position because of it to someone who has only been at the job for about 5-6 weeks. I feel that he’s doing everything wrong, again I’ve been doing this for a couple of years. And when it came to something cosmetic, I snipped at him because he literally contradicted himself not even a sentence before, about it not mattering as long as everything mirrors each other.

Me and my family live in an apartment complex and right behind them is a little land with a few trees (not a playground) where people park their cars. I have these neighbours with two kids, who every day will take their kids out and let them play there. What is frustating is that they cry and shout and scream..and you get point, for about 1 to 2 hours. We have a lovely park nearby with a playground and a fountain and a lot of benches to just sit and relax, surrounded by trees and flowers, I don't understand why they don't bring their kids to that park (which is literally 100m away) and let them play there. Sometimes when I come from school I wan't to sleep but I can't because of their screaming, and even though I close the windows I can still hear them. So far no one said anything to them, but I can't be the only one annoyed by this, can I? I apologize for my grammar mistakes, english is not my native language.	Asshole	1	0

bvmb6t	2019-06-01 16:01:08		AITA for telling my mother that my gf is straight?	"I've been with my girlfriend a year. 
She's queer; her words, not mine. 

She's been with many girls and I'm her 2nd boyfriend. 
My mother is a conservative woman, she loves my girlfriend which is great. 

We were at a family dinner last night and my sister asked my girlfriend very bluntly if she'd ever been with girls. Her reason for asking was that my girlfriend has tattoos and part of her head shaved, apparently. My sister took that to assume that she was somewhat gay or curious. My sister isn't as conservative, she's just very blunt but she wouldn't of cared if my gf was gay, bi, whatever. 

My girlfriend went to say something and I saw my mother's eyes burning through me. I cut my gf off to say that no, she wasn't and that she was straight. My gf went with it but when we got home I was in for a good shouting at. She told me that it made her feel I was ashamed of her. I explained that my mother would never accept her in the family if she knew and my gf responded ""and? That's her problem"". I told her I'm proud of her and who she is but that this could weaken my realtionship with my mother and that she should expect my boundaries and discomfort in sharing that information. Gf won't understand and is making it all about her sexuality as opposed to me just wanting to not cause a family rift. 

My mother likes her so much, I can't bare for her to turn her back on her just because she's not straight so I'd rather avoid that confrontation. 

My gf insists that I'm acting like a little boy, desperate for my mother's approval and that I need a back bone and to stand by her. I think that she's being selfish and that at present, her sexuality doesn't need to be identified to anyone because she's with me, a man. 

**TL;DR** my gf is queer. I lied and told my mother she wasn't to avoid awkwardness or arguments. She says I'm being immature and insensitive toward her."	Asshole	1	0

My roommate met a girl on Bumble recently. Apparently they fell in love immediately. As of a couple days ago they are “official.”

What she doesn’t know is that my roommate goes through women like he does beer on a Friday night. He’s been known to sleep with 2-3 different women every weekend. I’ve lived with the guy for just about 3 years (we are in our late 20s). 

So last night, we were all hanging out after work. I found myself in the kitchen with his girlfriend and she was asking a bunch of random questions. Eventually she asked the question of “How many women has he been with?” I kind of shrugged and tried to dodge the question. She refused to accept that answer and wanted an actual number. I said I didn’t know, which is true, it’s too high to count at this point. She persisted until finally I just blurted out: “Let’s put it this way, you’re just another number on his list, and that number is pretty high.”

She stayed for about another 10 minutes and then left without saying anything to anyone. She called my roommate and told him she was done, just like that. Of course she told him what I said and now my roommate refuses to talk to me.

I figured since I won't be using the gift card anytime soon, I'd just give it to a friend who needs it more than me, before I forget I have it.

My parents now decided to cover the costs for my next season ticket as a little reward for graduating University. Which I'm very grateful for, because money is a bit tight. They asked for the gift card back, as they can use it to partially pay for the new ticket. When I told my mother that I'd already given it away, she got angry. I explained that the gift card was mine, and that I could do with it whatever I wanted to - and besides it helped pay for a trip to visit her parents.

"I was having a movie night with my friend and her 5-year old daughter at her house, and all of a sudden, I hear a knock on the door. I open up the door, and it's a man I recognise called James. 

He says he came to surprise my friend (let's call her Jane) and take her out for dinner. James is not in a relationship with Jane - they've only been on one movie date and another dinner night, and for me, it kinda felt inappropriate for James to show up to her house unannounced, without even texting beforehand to know if she was free, and especially considering he knows has a 5-year old daughter who she would need to make babysitting arrangements for (I honestly have no idea where he was planning for the kid to stay). 

I told Jane I wanted to speak to her in private, and when we want to a private area, I told her I thought it felt widely inappropriate for James to show up announced and try and put ""pressure"" on her to accept his date. Although Jane was initially cool with the idea of the date, she ended up agreeing with me, and told James they could hang out another day. AITA for ruining a potentially great night?

It isn't really something I can support, or even propagate, it's just what I find myself believing. But I keep political opinions to myself because cramming it down peoples throats is just pointless. Pick you battles and all. But then when I get dragged into a conversation with my more heavily conservative friend, and he asks my opinion on Socialism, and Hate Speech, Religion, and Capitalism. Now my personal opinion is a mixed economy of Socialism and Capitalism seeing as that has been the balance that's supported some of the strongest economy's in the world (i.e. USA, Canada, England, Ireland). And that Hate Speech is a problem, but it's not for courts to decide, it's for society, don't fuck with my freedom of speech, I'll accept bullying for that.

bvm4dl	2019-06-01 15:43:20	importedidentity	AITA for wanting my mom to call me by my name and pronouns?	"Backstory: I came out as trans at 14. I don’t remember much of the day. But I remember she told me that while she respected this, it was too hard for her to call me by my chosen name and pronouns, and asked if she could call me a shortened version of my deadname for a bit (we’ll just say C). I respected this, and let her, but asked if she could call me by my pronouns. She said it’d be really hard for her so later. I gave up and accepted that too.

Fast forward 4 years. I’m 18 now, and have been with my identity strong, but go by a new name than my first one. My mom....hasn’t really come around. Though it’s been 4 years, my mom has still called me C “around 60% of the time so it should be fine!” 

I’ve asked her, throughout all these years, to switch up on the name and pronouns. At first, I went by Mike, but she didn’t want to call me that bc it was ugly. Then, I went by Justin, and she didn’t want to call me that bc it “reminded (her) of a cousin pair Justin and Jennifer, and (I) don’t have a Jennifer.” I got fed up, and asked her what name should I go by then? I offered Oliver, and she said she’d like that bc it’d go with my sisters name. For the 2 years I held that name, she never once called me Oliver. One time she even used my correct pronouns and then immediately apologized to me for it. I got fed up again, and went to pick a different name, I was stuck between Charlie and another name we’ll call Matt, and, not being the decision maker myself, I asked my mom what she preferred. She didn’t like either of them. I don’t know why she didn’t like Charlie, but she didn’t like Matt bc of a very, very awkward experience she had w someone of that name in high school. Instead, she offered names closer to C so she could continue calling me that, but bc of my journey with my deadname and my fight w my father, I didn’t want to be associated w it anymore. I tried to explain that to her, but she wouldn’t have it.

I picked Matt, btw, bc I felt it resonated w me more. This obviously didn’t help anything with the names bc she didn’t want to call me that. 

The pronouns never changed. I have asked her multiple, multiple times to go w he/him and call me her son, not daughter. Every time, the same excuse. 
“It’s just too hard for me to start doing it bc I’ve always known you as a girl.”
“I’m getting C down now (after 4 years), isn’t that enough??” And when I say how it’s been 4 years, she should have gotten it by now and that it’s just too close to my deadname for me to hate it, she says, “So then my progress means nothing to you??”
I’ve asked for gender neutral pronouns (they/them) and she says, “I will never see they/them as a pronoun for a singular person.”

She thinks I should give her a break bc it’s hard for her since she has known me as C for so long. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvm2fi	2019-06-01 15:38:16		AITA for not telling my Dad he’s not my Biological Father?	"Well I think I have healed enough from this to receive my judgement.  

Last year for my (31F) birthday I did an Ancestry DNA test.  Growing up I was not particularly very close with my dad (We’ll call him Jamal). Jamal has different religious views (Muslim) than what my mother raised me as (Christian) and that among basic personality differences prevented us from clicking. Most of my life he has pressured me to hurry up get married and have children so he can be a Grandfather. 

Jamal was paying $400 a month child support. He no longer wanted to pay and asked the judge for a paternity test. The judge denied this (I was already 13 at this point). Throughout my life I’ve always felt “not good enough” or like I’m not worth someone spending money on. Hence the discussion in therapy. 

Several years ago Jamal did an ancestry DNA test so that’s why I picked that brand. We only speak about 2-3 times a year. Usually about how I am, if I’m still in the service, and why I haven’t found someone to marry and have kids with. For my birthday I bought the test. 

A few weeks later I get the email that my results are ready. I share them with a friend who is from a country in Africa. He points out that I’m actually West African not East African like Jamal. I look at my matches and am shocked to see a different man listed as my Father. This leads to a lot of tears, a lot of alcohol, and basically feeling like I’ve lived a lie for 31 years. Due to some good friends I was able to connect with my biological father we’ll call him Avery. 

Avery is everything one could ask for in a Father. While it took some figuring out (turns out I’m not a premie, I was cooked to term), we’ve adjusted to this new normal. My mother and Avery get along well. Avery is also very proud of me and so supportive! Unfortunately, Avery has a job in the spotlight of sorts. At an event I attended, he shared his happiness with a few hundred people. Many who live in the same city as Jamal. 

I talked to my therapist about this and felt that it would be best coming from me. I chickened out 3 different times and one year later, Jamal still isn’t aware. He once asked if my results came back and I said there was an error. My therapist thinks it’s best to not share the details as it would cause drama and heartache that isn’t necessary. Eventually I agreed after thinking about my mother’s safety, Jamal’s heart, and the anxiety it would cause to discuss. My relationship is better with Jamal now knowing he stepped up and rightfully had reason to be unsure. I’ve been able to forgive him for a lot of my daddy issues, and I love him more now than ever. 

I plan to take care of Jamal as his only child when he gets old. I also want to give him the chance to be a Grandpa one day.

She has a fixed income from social security benefits, and a load of credit card bills. My parents are both mentally ill (schizophrenia & bipolar disorder) and do not work. They are in the process of bankruptcy (3rd time) and I gave my dad $500 to pay for his half of the fee recently, which came out of my $1500 emergency savings. Before they went bankrupt, a couple years ago, my brother paid off all their credit cards. They moved to another country and maxed out all their credit cards shortly after he paid them off. 
My parents have no vehicle so I drive them around constantly or lend them my car.  I make approx 18,000/yr. 
Well, anyway, I lived with my mom for about a week. I come home from work one day and  we get onto the topic of money and my mom and I start talking about her rent. She says shes totally broke (which I already know) and eats cereal twice a day, and only has $170 left after rent/utlities for the month. She started crying and asking how I could be so mean because I was firm about only paying $100 for rent and splitting utlilities and groceries. When she came back from europe she made a fuss about which apt to rent because she wanted to stay in a particular location, close to grocery stoes and the like as she has no vehicle. She wanted me to look for an apt for her... I was too busy working third shift and going to college during the day so I didnt. She blames me for the apt she lives in, which is nice and $800 a month. We all told her not to rent it because its ridiculously out of budget but she thought she had no choice, even though she didnt make the effort to look elsewhere. Thats why I didnt want to pay more than $100 for rent. She was stupid for renting such a pricy place in the first place and had plenty of time to find a cheaper place but chose not to. I already told her this a long time ago, and repeatedly, and told her I was only giving $100. I promptly moved back out. She called me crazy and mean and started saying nobody cares about her and has not talked to me since. In my perspective they have had enough help and at 22 and with goals of my own I cannot help support them that much. They are mentally ill and uneducated immigrants but at this rate I feel like I should look out for myself.  I sort of wish I could cut them out of my life. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Before we left, I forgot some strawberries and raspberries in my gf's parent's fridge. (She lives with them) I said her parents were welcome to enjoy the fruit as we wouldn't be back for 5 days. 

Last night her mom asked that we detour to pick up the fruit on our way back to my house. That would likely turn into a full visit, which neither the gf or I feel up to after ~10 hours of travel, including a plane ride. We planned on one last chill night together before taking her home the next day. 

We instead asked if I could pick up the fruit when I dropped her off the next day. She replied saying that she had a reason for asking us to stop but she guesses we ""saved her the effort."" She then said that she was planning to use the strawberries to make a pie for us to take back to my apartment (but now wouldnt) The gf explained that based on what was sent to us it hadn't made sense for us to go out of our way for the produce when we would be there the next day.

He comes over quite a bit to our house, and helps around the house, which is very nice of him and I know most people wouldn't do that. He has his flaws though, but that is not what this is about. I have a really demanding job, which I have a month off from. This is probably the only extended time (like more than a week where I don't have to do side projects for work) that I will get off for the next five years. 

&#x200B;

My mom has this guy over every, single day. He lives alone and in the 10 years they've been going out she has probably been out there 15 times because he's always up at our place. She says that I should be happy because he gets stuff done around the house. It is fine when I am working, but has been a big hassle since I have had this time off. She is a teacher so she is about to be off for summer break and is currently working. I asked her if she'd mind having him over less until I return to work or go to his place and hang out and that will coincide with her summer break. When I return to my 12 hour shifts she could have him over all day and it wouldn't affect me at all. It turned into a yelling match about how she says that I am so selfish for asking. She has always entertained men at our house and it has been something I've dealt with since my dad passed when I was a kid. 

&#x200B;

We have a relatively small house with only one room common area so I normally sit in my room and play xbox, but it is less comfortable because I have to look presentable and I mean somebody is over you know so you have to be nice and entertain? To mitigate this, I have been avoiding them and not saying much. I know my mom does a lot for me. She does the dishes and laundry and a lot of household chores which make my life a breeze that way. I am appreciative of all that her and her boyfriend do for me, and that is not the issue at all. I just want some time to unwind. It is her house so maybe I am being disrespectful asking her to have him over less. I also realize this is her house. She lets me live here rent free to help me and pays the bills, and I know that is WAY more than a lot of parents would do."		1	0

"My sister went on an interchange to Japan for a year, when she was there she told my brother and I that we should visit her and after sometime my parents agreed on letting us travel by ourselves and bought us the tickets, we'll be going the last two weeks of my sister's interchange and she’s coming back with us.

I was really excited for this for a lot of reasons: I always wanted to go to Japan, I haven’t seen my sister for around a year and it’s going to be my first trip without my parents, just my siblings and I...or that was the plan.

My cousin is around my sister’s age and they are really close, she’s been in a rough spot for two years now and doesn’t want to look for professional help. Around two months ago while I was video chatting with my sister she told me that my cousin wanted to tag along, I didn’t like the idea but said nothing. I commented this to my brother and we thought the same, we didn’t like the idea, this was just a siblings trip and my cousin and us don’t really have the same interests so she wouldn't like the places we chose to visit. We waited for my sister to told us about it again but she didn’t so we thought that she wasn’t coming.

Fast forward to a week ago, my sister told us again the idea, my aunt got an inheritance and she is going to give some of it for my cousin’s trip, so now it almost official that she’s going.

My brother said that there was nothing we can do and that I have to learn that sometimes things don't go the way we want, he doesn’t think i’m an asshole but I do, I feel awful for not wanting her to go with us but I can’t help it, I idealized this trip a lot and now everything changed.

To clean the right part of the window, you need;

 - A person to help you hold it as it does not have any locks to keep it in place. If you do this on your own it will just swing forward with your body weight.
 - To put most of your body in the air with very little supporting you.

If you slip you will basically fall 3 stories and die or worst.

One of my parents told me about their life threatening disease. People with this disease have a median life expectancy of <3 years.

They told me that they haven't told my youngest sibling about their diagnosis, and don't plan to for the foreseeable future.

We open at 10 a.m. and close at 10 p.m. I have a small staff and we all work hard everyday. Yesterday was a pretty quiet day, it wasn't slow but it wasn't busy either. It was Friday night, the weather is nice and people want to go home after a 12-hour shift.

At 9:40 p.m. 20 minutes before we close, a party at 15 comes walking through the door expecting service. I approached two of the gentleman and told them we was about to close in 20 minutes and if they wanted their food they needed to get it to go. The one guy looked at me with a snarky look, and pointed at his watch to symbol we was still open for 20 minutes. I tried to explain it by the time I was finished cooking their food it would already be past 10 and I didn't want to rush them through their meal. I told him the only way I would allow them to sit down and eat, is if they prepaid with a 25% gratuity to make it worth it for my servers to stay late.

After my request, the whole party got all pissy and left. Seriously though they expect us to stay late, because they came 20 minutes before we closed!"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvlq7x	2019-06-01 15:05:11	ohohfourr	AITA for defending myself when people accused me of stealing copypastas?	"OK, I don’t know why I did this. But here goes. 

I like to shitpost and post copypasta, so I tidied up a few copypastas, formatted them as proper bodies of text and posted them in a writing group just to see what people would think of them. Would they view them as legitimate works of art despite the true irony of them? 

Well, to my surprise, they were quite well received. I thought these reactions were funny so I left the posts up to get some screenshots and send to friends. But I never replied to any comments or claimed that any were my own work. 

The issue is that because they were just copypastas, I didn’t bother crediting them to anyone. Big mistake and my fault entirely. I’m so used to just dropping a copypasta off and having people know it’s a joke. I realize that this is wrong.

People started finding the copypasta online and accusing me of stealing. Then they started calling me a serial plagiarist. Which, to be fair, makes sense in a literal case because I did not attribute credit and posted numerous copypastas.

But with plagiarism, people often also insinuate that you are stealing on purpose and trying to pass it off as your own. So they were also calling me a thief, an attention seeking person, that I couldn’t write etc. 

I said this wasn’t my writing but they didn’t care at this point, they kept saying that I was someone who didn’t understand the seriousness of what I’ve done and that I was going to ruin my career. I really wanted to delete the posts but that would’ve looked fishy, so I kept them up and more people tore into me. 

We all got into a big argument and I just hate this all because now people think I am a writer who steals and passes off others work as my own. I couldn’t help but defend myself (not my actions, but my writing skills/ability) when things got nasty because they started accusing me of being a flat out thief who couldn’t write. They say that I don’t understand how doing this is going to ruin my future. About how people like this just keep copying until they get caught. About how I was only remorseful because I got caught. 

 I feel insulted because I have the extensive background of writing and I don’t need to pass someone else’s work off as my own. I was just joking around. But I understand their reaction. Plagiarism is serious within the art community and should be punished or called out appropriately. Authors need to be credited even if it’s something as simple as a copypasta. This has taught me a valuable lesson.

My other big mistake was not clarifying immediately that they weren’t mine. People viewed this as me accepting the compliments and whatnot. I just wanted to see more funny comments. I feel ashamed. 

I made a mistake. I am now wondering if it was OK to defend myself when people started saying I only steal and couldn’t write? I was not defending or justifying my actions. Or am I in the wrong? I don’t know if my feelings are valid or anything. Please any help is appreciated."	Asshole	0	0

I'm normally nocturnal so I didn't get to sleep. I planned on napping when the 3 year old took his nap.

My friend has been talking to this guy off and on for a few months. He finally stayed the night with her for the first time last night but was gone before I got here. For some reason, he invited himself back over right after she left for work. I figured she texted him and told him to help me babysit so I could nap.

We chatted for about an hour and then I asked if he would watch the kids while I go upstairs and take a nap. He said that was fine. I fell asleep and woke up about 10 minutes ago to him climbing into bed with me... I thought he was trying to wake me up. I asked if he wanted to ""change shifts"" and if the kids needed something. He said no and that I could go back to sleep.

I'm now extremely creeped out. I didn't ask for him to be here and I don't know why he would think it's okay to try to sleep next to me. I've only met him one other time.

We were ordering our food, sitting on the opposite side of these people but they could see us clearly and we could see them.
My mom went to wash her hands and this guy that was rubbing his feet on this other chair, close to an empty table was looking at my mom with a smirk and grinning with his mate.
I told my mom when she came to sit down and she told me to mind my business. 
I also found it so disrespectful that the guy would put his naked feet on another chair.
He wasn't even sick or in any pain whatsoever. 
Imo he was just being a jerk.
He even winked at me and wiggled his toes. I cringed inside.
I didn't want to see this guys face whatsoever and was getting agitated by the minute as he was being rude and catcalling the waiter, even asking for her number. She cleary being uncomfortable by this.
My mom and I were in an argument because I said how I found behaviour like that so disgusting.
She then started speaking Dutch (the language all people understand here, we are in Suriname) even though her native language is Portuguese and we were conversing quietly in that language. She decided to say quite loudly in broken Dutch ""just go to the guy and say sir put your feet off the chair. It's disgusting."" She was being sarcastic and saying other things to agitate me, luckily they didn't hear her lol 
I moved my seat, and sat with my back now towards the people.
I told my dad about that and he said that the guy's behaviour was indeed unrespectful, but I shouldn't do anything.. since he is also a customer and the waiter herself didn't speak up..
Another group of people walked into the restaurant and a kid wanted to sit there but the feet was apparently smelly and the kid said ""ew"" and moved to another table, the parents were annoyed and didn't sit there but somewhere else, away from that guy. The guy and his mate were laughing and he was wiggling his toes and smirking at the kid. The parents didn't see this though..
I ended up ignoring those people and simply eating my meal.. but I should probably have infact said something, so infact I probably am the asshole.. for not speaking up.

bvlht2	2019-06-01 14:41:52		AITA for telling the truth?	"Throwaway just to be sure.

I am 21 years old and finished school at 18 and got offered a job immediatly, I worked till 20 and quit because I saved a decent amount and wanted to relax a bit/travel.

My dad has his own cleaning company and runs it with my brother. unfortunalty my grandpa got cancer and my dad had to travel to his home country alot to visit him.

We are a tight family and my dad was not able to get someone to pick up his work for short amounts of time (he went like a week/2 and came back).

So I always helped my brother when he had to leave, my dad always gave me money for the hours I worked but my brother did not when I helped him at his customers. 

That was no problem at all since I did not do it for the money at all but to help my dad which is a hero to me.

2 weeks ago my grandpa died and my dad had to leave to go to his funeral of course, as usual I picked up his work and helped my brother.

My only concern always was to not get in trouble, get the job done and wait for my dad to get back.

As always this went decent, except for the relation with my brother, he has a extremely short temper and always rages hard he is 28.

On the day my dad would get back we were at our last customer of the day, I was doing my thing and he was doing his. 

Until he said to me why are you not walking straight you are embarassing me, I was like wtf but was used to this dumb behavior and just ignored it, a few mins later he comes back and calls me out for ignoring him.. i told him to fuck off and he starts cussing me out.

A hour later I was finished and sat down to wait for him to finish, he was finishing up.

When he saw me sitting he told me why the fuck I was sitting and I had to help him finish up.

 I ignored again, he told me to fuck off and told me I cant get in the car w him to get home.

I said fine give me my jeans which were in his car, and said some bad words aswell after all this he grabbed my by the throat.

He left me there with no money/ID.

Luckily I could buy a train ticket with my phone and was able to get come.

Here comes the worst part:

In the year/ year and half that I quit my job and my dad went out of country I got hooked on gambling and weed and lost 5k my brother also lost 5k which i lend him with the promise he would pay back asap.

My parents did not know about any of this, my parents are not strict but would not prefer me smoking weed, gambling they see as a very bad thing tho.

After what happend last time with my brother I was done keeping secrets from my parents and told them that I smoke weed, and fucked some serious money up gambling.

They were happy I told them and told me mistakes are to be made

I want to better my life, my dad confronted my brother and now my brothers wife also knows about it which he kept it a secret from.

All in all, I am having a rough time atm and just wanted to know if I am the asshole for starting all this drama or was this the right decision.

bvlhqc	2019-06-01 14:41:36		AITA for giving a shy kid flowers in front of an audience?	"Throwaway because people know my main.

At the end of every month, our high school will do a ""coffeehouse"" where people will pay $5 to watch other students perform. What they perform is up to them, anything like comedy skits and solo sonatas are fair game. Usually, not a ton of people go to these. However it was the final event of the year so it was packed with about 130 people.

There is this infamously shy kid in my math class. He doesnt have great social skills but is actually unbelievably funny if you listen. He gets freaked out if you try to talk to him in the hallways or anything like that. I (was) kinda friends with him. My friend and I were joking around with this shy kid and talking about how we were gonna bring our friend group to coffeehouse to cheer him on. He was performing that night and we were all hyped to see him go because he's insanely good at anything musical.

A couple hours before the event, he texted me and asked me to not make a scene. Then, his friend that was performing with him asked me not to go crazy and embarrass him. Okay, and we changed our plans around so it would just be my friend and I giving him flowers.

At coffeehouse, my friend and I were so excited to see him go perform his set. When he took his spot on stage, my friend and I walked up the aisle and handed him the flowers in front of the audience. My friend then proceeded to take the microphone and said ""these are for (name) because hes amazing"" 

He didnt smile, but he did say thank you. Hes a pale guy, but he turned so white I swear I could almost see through him. My friend and I took our seats and watched him do his set, which was phenomenal. We cheered his name when he finished.

Me, my friend, and another girl left shortly after. Social media is blocked under school wifi so we couldn't check anything until we got back to my house. It was there that we realized that both of us had been blocked by him on every platform and also scolded by multiple people for giving him flowers. 

Nothing was done with malintent. We have no way to talk to him until Tuesday. We actually love this guy and were in no way trying to ruin his night. AITA?"		1	0

We moved over 1000 miles this year to be closer to my family. We have two young children and they haven’t gotten to know my parents, siblings, cousins, ect. 

My mom has been asking us for years to consider moving here. Noting that we’d have better childcare and a pool for the kids to swim in all summer. 

It’s June 1st. The pool at their house is still not open because my step father has “chores” he wants done before he’ll open the pool. The first time he said it I thought he was joking. He wants their kitchen painted, cabinets stripped and stained, back doors painted, crown molding painted, some electrical outlets replaced, and the backsplash retiled. Basically a light fucking kitchen remodel. 

Last weekend I realized he was serious so I said hell with it. I told him i wasn’t going to have our kids summer held hostage for shit he should have just asked for help with. That’s the thing, i never have issue helping out with stuff, but having this used as leverage against me made me feel like he was treating me like i was 16 all over again. So this week I bought us season passes to a water park and we’re currently enjoying the day here. 

He’s furious, my mom is upset because he’s upset, but she thinks he should have just asked. My siblings think I’m a total AH, but I don’t see any of their asses over there doing any of it, and they’ve lived close for years. None of them are being asked to do this stuff, I’m just very handy. My phone has been blowing up all morning from my older brother telling me how childish I’m behaving. I finally just blocked him, not forever, but I’m trying to enjoy my day with the kids and wife. 

But it’s nagging at me. Should i have just did the weekend or so worth of work to keep the peace? I feel conflicted because I don’t like my mom being upset, but I don’t like being leveraged into doing anything, it makes me bitter and I know that about myself. So I took a few minutes to ask the Internet for some perspective. I’m going back to play with the kids so I won’t be replying until this evening. Tomorrow we will either come back here to the park, or I will do a bunch of shit around their house.  

We have visited their house every weekend since we moved up here in September. We cook or bring food every time. They have watched the kids for us several times so we could have date nights and that’s been nice. We all do things out once a month or so. Just some background info for what our normal relationship is.

bvlfqj	2019-06-01 14:35:41	drooling_everyday	AITA for withholding the room key from the next subtenant because the main tenant wouldn't refund my deposit on the day I move out?	"I've been a subtenant at a place for two years, mainly dealing with a main tenant (Michelle) instead of the owner. I pay my rent on time every month to Michelle (bar once or twice where I forgot) and generally had no issues. As part of the subleasing agreement, I gave Michelle 800 bucks as a security deposit.

Two months ago I notified Michelle that I'm going to move out at the end of May, as per the agreement. I  posted notices on the notice board even though it's not my responsibility to find a new subtenant as a replacement. I made time out of my schedule to allow people to view the room and other rooms I wasn't staying in (again, I don't think it's my responsibility).

One week ago someone (Lee) finally decided to rent the room. Great, yay! Lee scheduled to get the room key from me today afternoon. Note that Michelle is pretty absent from the picture because she's in another state. 

Today morning I was told by Michelle that I would receive the security deposit on 10th June after I move out because the Lee can only pay on 7th June. I told her it's absurd (calmly); the next tenant being late on payments shouldn't be my problem. She did not reply for hours despite me asking for updates. In the end I had to tell her that I want the security deposit before I pass the key to Lee. Only then she acquiesced and refunded me (after I sent her photographic proof that the room suffered no damages from me).

Although she didn't outwardly say anything, I could sense that she was pretty pissed off from her replies. She also kicked me out from the group chat when she has never done that previous subtenants.

I felt I was well within my rights to request for the refund on the day I move out but I may be wrong in 'threatening' to withhold the key. 

TLDR: Main tenant wanted to postpone refunding me my renting deposit, reason cited was future tenant will be late in their payment. I felt that isn't my problem and 'threatened' to withhold the key until I get my money back. Am I the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Now when she was in rehab from her surgery or did normal gym work, I'm not sure, she met a boy  and now is dating him for a few months.

bvldc3	2019-06-01 14:28:57	maidai00	AITA for wanting to quit my job because of my mom	"So I work a chicken restaurant that's only on the east coast with my mom, I've only been working here for two months now.
My mom is a smoker and takes FREQUENT smoke breaks, while the others don't (I am the only employee on night shift that doesn't smoke). Her smoke break will last 30 minutes to an hour and she will just leave and not tell anyone.
She also basically leaves her job to me. On Tuesdays and Fridays our truck comes and the manager and bagger/middle person for front line are the ones who need to unpack it. This can take a few minutes to hours depending on what time the truck arrives and how much was ordered. So last night I was middle and had to help my manager unpack and by the time we finished it a minute or two past closing. So I start breaking down the front line (throwing food away) and my mom just dips and after 30 or so minutes she comes back. I asked if I was done because I just finished unpacking an entire truck, breaking down front line, and cleaning out the wells and she tells me no and that I need to help her and started yelling ""She thought she was done"" and ""She knows she still needs to help me"", all she has to do is make half gallons, wash the kegs and kettle that hold the tea and coffee (all you have to do is rinse it out, only takes five minutes for the large one), and clean her floors, these are the drive thru person's tasks.
I've worked on drive thru since I started and I'm  usually already cleaning my floors before 10:30, because I'll clean out drive thru kettle and kegs (coffee kettle and unsweet tea keg) I don't need about 5 minutes before closing (10pm) and start filling up half gallons at nine or earlier depending on if we have any so I easily finish before 10:30. Anyway, back to my rant. 
I sweep, scrub, and squeegie her floors (drive thru and front line) and by the time I finish it's 11:08. Remember that I'm middle person doing her drive thru tasks that she could have completed before 11 at least if she hadn't gone on a smoke break.
Also, since I started working with her, she put me on drive thru even though she knows I'm not a people person like her and I can be rude when I get irritated. I wanted to work in the back away from people but I'm now work front and have to interact with customers.
So all of this combined with the fact that she's a hypocrite and basically tells everything I tell her to her friends, which makes it hard for me to want to tell her anything, makes me want to quit and move out next month as opposed to next year.

So AITA for wanting quit and move out sooner?

Update: I did it. I quit. I told her (i also told her i was looking for a new job) and she called me a lazy bitch and told me to find another job so I can hurry and get the fuck out. So i might move out before my senior year is over just to get away from her. So wish me luck"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So, this happened like... 10 years ago at a Halloween party, I was 12, my friend and his friends at the party were 12. We kind of had our party upstairs and their younger siblings (think like... 6) had their party downstairs.

I'd prepped for this party, it was a costume party and I found this badass werewolf mask, so I took some old clothes and some faux fur, cut up my clothes almost to shreds and sewed the patches of fur to the underside of the rips.

So it looked like I was ""transforming"" and bursting out of my clothes.  I thought it was really cool.

Anyways, party starts and my friend loves my costume, party is awesome and about an hour in I nip to the bathroom. Which is under the stairs...

So I go to the bathroom and hear people walking past towards the kitchen, I assumed it was my friends (I didnt know about their younger siblings having their own party, because of the layout of the house, I walked in, then went upstairs instantly without even seeing them)

So of course I put my mask on, finish up and JUMP OUT  snarling and moving my head around like I'm ""turning""
(It's really hard to see in the mask) 
I hear screaming and smile before I realise it's a little too high pitched... I look closely and... I just terrified a bunch of 4-5-6 year olds... I take my mask off and immediately apologise, the parents think it's all just a bit of fun gone wrong...

So I laugh it off with them and the kids seem okay when they realise it's just me...

I go upstairs and tell the story, my friend and his friends get pissed and beat me up.

I was telling this story recently to one of my newer friends and they said I shouldn't be jumping out and scaring people at a party, someone could have gotten hurt. 

So, TL:DR I got a badass costume, was proud of it, tried to scare my friends, scared their much younger siblings instead

"Some background: we have a 40lb sheep dog who nipped a kid many years ago (didn't break the skin) we had to go to dog training classes and pay a fine. Since then we were overly cautious to avoid any similar situations, lest the county determine that our dog is a danger to society and euthanize her.

The story:

My partner and I were walking our leashed dogs. We walked past some people who had their unleashed dogs in the front yard. The unleashed dogs started to run towards us. The owner stood there, calling his dogs. I yelled ""hey, grab your dogs"" the unleashed dogs came and caused lots of growling, barking and tangled leashed (no biting from either party)

I yelled ""grab your fucking dogs!"" The guy told me not to be a dick and and to ""back down"", he grabbed his dogs and we walked away.

bvl6vf	2019-06-01 14:10:37	Darcy_is_my_lobster	AITA for letting a shoplifter get away with it?	"So, this happened the other day. I was out running errands with one of my kids and I popped into one of the shops in the UK know for bargains and making your pound go further.

For a little background the area I live in is probably about 50% poor and 50% OK. This particular shops staff have always struck me as being unhappy to be there. They've given me this impression by arguing with each other at the tills in front of customers, yelling for each other across the shop (it's maybe school swimming pool sized) and getting terse yells back, swearing barely under their breath etc. The manager is in her 20s I think and she will regularly berate her staff in public. I've always just got my bargains and moved on.

On this particular day I was in the cleaning goods aisle and I spotted a woman popping canisters of air freshener into a shopping bag and not the basket she had which held one cheap item. She maybe grabbed 10 before putting the basket item back on the shelf and sauntering off.

Having previously worked retail this irked me. Had it been food she was pilfering I may have ignored it (our local food bank has been taking a hammering recently due to poverty) but air fresheners?? So I decided to point it out to a member of staff and let them deal with it.

The first member of staff I saw was the manager stocking a shelf. I went over and said ""excuse me"" and before I could say anything further she muttered ""fuck sake"" and rolled her eyes as she stood up. I admit I saw red and instead of saying what I planned said ""nevermind, I changed my mind"".

As I was queuing I spotted shoplifter lady head out the door with her full bag completely bypassing the till area.

I've told the story to a couple of people who all agreed with me based on her attitude. But the ex retail worker in me feels guilty. So AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvl6nr	2019-06-01 14:10:04		AITA for telling my girlfriend that it is her turn to buy food (this somehow caused us to break up)	"Last Saturday me and my girlfriend were going to order a pizza, she prompted me to get my phone out and buy it and the conversation went as follows.

Me: Isn't it your turn to buy the pizza?

Gf: Huh, I don't think so, I made you food on Thursday

Me: I've bought food nearly every day this week

Gf: No, I made you food on Thursday and I was working late this week too

Me: No, I bought food yesterday, wednesday and monday, I even brought some breakfast this morning

Gf: Why are you being such a dick right now?

Me: I'm not, I just think it's your turn

Gf: You are, you're being a complete dick

Me: Why are you being like this? Fine then, I'll buy it

Gf: Why, so you can hold that over my head too?

\*storms out of room and calls me a dick one last time\*

&#x200B;

The reaction was a bit unexpected, I just genuinely felt like I shouldnt be buying her a pizza since I bought nearly ever meal this week. She broke up with me later that night, I asked if she was serious about breaking up and she said yes and she would be returning to her mother's house tomorrow.

It started getting late and I was very hungry, I hadnt eaten all day so I asked her a few more times if she wanted a pizza and she just shook her head and called me ""unbelievable"". When she went to bed I took the oppourtunity to order myself a pizza, when the pizza arrived she completely flew off the handle for ordering myself food.

bvl4zh	2019-06-01 14:05:16	cupcakewife	AITA for telling my ex how to parent our children?	"My ex-husband and I split up about a year ago. We share custody of our 2 kids, a 12 year old son and a 7 year old daughter, 50/50. For the most part, we’ve been co-parenting pretty well but recently had a fight over this one issue. 

Our children are both overweight, the daughter moreso than the son. At her last doctor’s appointment, I was told her BMI is in the 98th percentile. I decided that, for the sake of the kids’ health, we needed to make better dietary choices. It’s been going well while they’re at my house, but recently when I took my daughter’s lunchbox out of her book bag and saw what my ex had packed her, I realized that he’s not making any effort to give them anything nutritious. I found the remains of a Nutella on white bread sandwich, a bag from some gummy fruit snacks, two fun-sized candy bar wrappers, and a bag with some potato chip crumbs in it. And that was it. Her entire lunch. 

So I asked her what else she had eaten at her dad’s that day: a pop tart for breakfast, and plain pasta with hot dogs for dinner. Then for dessert they went to an ice cream shop. I asked about snacks, and she said she’d eaten some cheez-its. Any fruit? Nope. Vegetables? Nope. Was this a normal day at his house? Yep. 

I brought my concerns to him and told him, “I’m a little worried because the doctor said both the kids are overweight. Daughter told me what she eats at your house, and it sounds like there’s a lot of sugar and very little protein or fruits or vegetables.” He shrugged and said “I just feed them what they’ll eat.” I said “they’re willing to eat healthier stuff at my house.” He said “well good for you, but I’m not wasting my time and money on food I know is going to end up in the trash.” I told him that it was our job as their parents to give them healthy options to eat, not just junk, and he blew up and said I could give them whatever I want when they’re at my house, and he’ll give them whatever he wants when they’re at his house, and it’s really none of my business. I disagreed because what he feeds them affects their health even when they’re not with him. He told me to stop telling him how to parent, he doesn’t need my help, he’s perfectly capable without me butting in, and that it’s really bitchy of me to tell him what to do when he would never do that to me.

bvl46n	2019-06-01 14:03:03	Roxith	AITA for calling my sister out	"My big sister and I are very close and always have been. When I was young, she would stand up to my older brother who bullied me because, with me, he wasn’t the only son anymore. For this, I’ve always been grateful to my sister. Now, my brother and I are very close as well. However, my sister has this thing where she always boasts about how street smart she is, how she can easily find locations with ease. 

This is true for the most part and we usually rely on her for finding locations while my brother and I would usually talk about nerdy stuff. So we’re in Japan now and my brother and I go on talking while my sister google maps her way to finding the hotel. She stops at one location that forks into 4 different locations about a half a block away from the hotel were staying in and says “Okay! Which way to the hotel, boys!” with  a victorious smile in her face. My brother and I, usually relying on my sister for directions on family vacations and mostly been paying attention to our conversations make incorrect guesses. My brother makes a wild guess while I try to see if the trail is familiar and point north. Both are incorrect, however, and she laughs hysterically with a knowing smile. It was apparently the third time we’ve walked this path to our hotel. 

She then texts to our parents about  “how sad it was that we couldn’t determine the correct place to walk” with a facepalm emoji and I reply “I would have just used google maps” if I really needed to find out. My dad then texts that I should be more observant because google maps is not always accurate. I thought this was a little unfair because I was under the assumption that we would never be apart on this vacation (my family always sticks together when doing activities) so I could rely on my sister and concentrate on my conversations with my brother. I then reply that “it’s a bit unfair that my sister, who used google maps to find the hotel could critique us when we were under the impression that we didn’t need to and weren’t studying the location via maps” to which my sister replies “I didn’t need google maps to get us to the hotel” (but she clearly used it). To me, it was like we were given an exam that we weren’t told about vs my sister who studied for this exam, looked in the internet, and then said “how could you not know this?” in a very matter of fact way. I thought it was another play of her petting her ego so I called her out on this fact but she reacted with “you arguing is even sadder than you not knowing.” Maybe I was wrong about calling it ego petting but i just thought it was.

Edit: Thank you all who’ve replied so far! I made sure to upvote all your comments for taking the time to reply. I really do love my sister for what she does for me so I was torn about whether calling her out was the right thing to do. Reading your comments is helpful."	No A-holes here	0	0

Please note Margaret and Susan hardly know each other and I asked Margaret if it's fine for my friend to stay at her house as well which she agreed to. 

Well last minute Susan is telling me one of her mates is gonna meet us at the airport and if it's fine to go with us to Margaret's house.

The plan was he was gonna drop his stuff and go out to party and pick up his stuff in the morning and go to his other mates house to stay there. 


The morning came and he comes to the house saying : ohh I really need some sleep, and proceeded to get on the bed and try and sleep. 

Me and Margaret got uncomfortable and I took Susan to the side (bathroom) to ask if he's got a place to go as I don't think my friend is comfortable with having a stranger stay at her house while we're not there (we were going out). 


Well he heard us talk and got really upset. Called all his mates to try and find a place to crash and packed his stuff and left. 

Now I feel like shit. I've got nothing against the guy, he's nice but I felt bad about brining a stranger to my friends house and the way he acted made me think he thought he was gonna stay here for the weekend.

bvl2n2	2019-06-01 13:58:46	k0ella	AITA for not moving for a couple's wedding photoshoot?	"It sounds horrible but idk.

I've been planning to surprise my boyfriend with a picnic for a while. We finally had one yesterday, where I took him to a park and blindfolded him while I set the stuff up because I wanted to surprise him in the most romantic way possible.

When we first got there, I was already disappointed as it was raining hard and we couldn't get a good sunny spot in the grass. I had to choose a small bridge with a rooftop, that overlooked a little lake with tortoises and fish. We weren't blocking the path, we were on the side.

I spent probably a good 15 minutes setting things up, pouring drinks out in glasses and putting food out nicely. I brought card games and home baked brownies. Just as I finished setting up, a couple in their wedding clothes and cameramen walked towards us. I had to make my boyfriend open his eyes and it completely ruined the surprise as i panicked and didnt know what to do. We knew they wanted to take the spot for a photo. It was raining, so the usual pretty spots arent available and the bridge was the most symmetrical and nicer places that day.

The couple and the others ended up walking away after some discussion amongst themselves, but we felt terrible for not packing away immediately. This is their one in a lifetime moment, it was already raining, and we took the prettiest spot in the park. We must have been visibly panicking or upset about this moral dilemma, as one of them had to reassure us it's fine.

We caught the bride and groom looking at us from across the lake a few times. The rest of the picnic ended quickly and wasn't relaxing or enjoyable at all, because all we could talk about or do is worry about what just happened. We felt super guilty for not leaving immediately for someone's one of a lifetime photoshoot that they would cherish and remember for the rest of their lives. But on the other hand I felt upset because *a)* I spent a long time preparing this surprise. (Exam week ended the day before, and it was the one thing we wanted to do to relieve the stress and have fun for the first time in a while.), *b)* We had nowhere else to go because rain and *c)* I spent a long time setting up.

The couple never actually confronted us but it was clear that they wanted the spot. One of the cameramen pointed at our setup and quite passive aggressively shouted to the other that ""theres a picnic going on"".

We know that it was a public space and we had the right to stay, but I felt guilty for it. This was a BIG day for them and was likely upsetting. I don't know if they returned as we left shortly. We're also pretty young (17) and I felt terrible, feeling that they probably thought of us as immature puppy love and just a much smaller deal than their marriage, which made us assholes for not prioritizing them.

My day felt completely ruined. My boyfriend kept telling me he still loved that I put in a lot of effort, but I feel immense guilt over not immediately packing up for someone's wedding, and I need an unbiased opinion. Reddit, AITA?"	No A-holes here	0	0

bvl15h	2019-06-01 13:54:20		AITA for being upset that my boyfriend always gives me gifts from the thrift store he works at?	"I can tell they come from the thrift store because of the condition (eg black texta scribble on the bottom of a box he gave me, random fluff stuck to the velvet lining of jewellery boxes, photo frames where the back looks very bashed up.)

&#x200B;

I am not fundamentally opposed to thrift stores or anything... I actually love thrifting! But when he always gets items cheaply from work it makes me feel like he doesn't value me very much. If he happened to see something one day and thought it would be perfect for me I would appreciate it. (This has happened in the past and I love it when that happens... eg I collect coins and he once gave me one he had found at work)

&#x200B;

But to me it feels less thoughtful because the items can be Not Quite Right, which makes it seem like it's about price and convenience.  For example for Christmas part of the gift he gave me was a travel diary. I do like travel. But it was made of leather. I have been vegetarian for 10 years (and had expressed discomfort at leather in the past). He didn't notice it was made of leather when buying it (it said it on the front). 

&#x200B;

If he had made the conscious choice to get me a diary and was making a choice between 2 or more diaries to buy me, I feel like that wouldn't have happened because he could have compared the diaries and made a considered choice based on who I am. Instead it's based on what is available (ie what other people have thrown away). 

&#x200B;

From his perspective, it's environmentally friendly and he says he does put thought into them so he got upset when I explained how always receiving second hand gifts makes me feel."		1	0

bvl06p	2019-06-01 13:51:17	Rukenau	AITA for telling an older lady she should watch her mouth around her grandkid?	"TBH I'm pretty sure I was not the asshole, but I guess I still need external validation and I will explain why. 

I was biking home from work and since my city (Moscow, Russia) isn't equally bike-friendly everywhere, oftentimes I need to ride on the sidewalk. I normally take good care to give pedestrians a wide berth, but this particular place was very narrow and there was no way I could ride around it on the road because it was packed with cars. So I slow down and ride past an older lady and a girl. I'm very certain that, at no point in this process, was there any real possibility I'd hit the girl.

Then with a slight lag I realise that somebody said a very audible ""dickhead"" behind me. It was in Russian (""придурок!""), so the exact translation may be something of a cross between ""douchebag""/""idiot""/""dickhead"", you get it. It is far from the most obscene expletive, but in any case it is not a word you say to strangers. So I make a slow turn and return to these two and say, ""Excuse me, but did you just say that to me?"" She goes, ""You nearly hit my granddaughter"". I said, ""No I didn't, I take care to ride accurately, and in any case that's no way to teach your granddaughter to address strangers"". She says nothing. I say to the girl, ""I'm sorry, sweetie, I didn't mean to"", and leave.

Now this is where I'm conflicted: I was very conscious that my return might look threatening to them, so I remained like five meters away, and I never raised my voice, and never approached them. But I am still a (somewhat) large guy on a bike effectively confronting a granny and her kid.

Do you think it would've been better to just ride away? AITA?

Edit. Thanks for giving me a couple of new angles, Reddit. Just to be sure, at no point was there any risk in running over anyone. And frankly, some people's notions of grand-parenting are rather flummoxing. My actions notwithstanding (and I agree now I should have just ridden away)—apparently any sort of shitty behaviour is protected now if it transpires between an elder and their kid? I'm not sure I can entirely agree with that. Otherwise the judgment is accepted with humble thanks."	Asshole	0	0

bvkyrr	2019-06-01 13:47:16	WillJ_UK	AITA for letting my girlfriend stay over?	"First some background, I am a 21 year old student and live in a flat with two friends (1 male (A) 1 female (D)). I have known my flatmates for 2.5 years and we kind of gelled because we were all a bit shy and to be honest, losers. Recently, I decided to make an effort to be more social and lose weight/present myself better and have been seeing my girlfriend (S) for around 6 months now. She stays over 1-2 nights per week and my female flatmate in particular really doesn't like it. She first started staying over in January this year and D mentioned that she wanted me to tell her when S was going to stay over. For a couple of months, I did message D to tell her whenever S was going to come over. After a while, I stopped, with the justification to myself being that I am 21, D is 22, we are both adults and I should be able to have S stay over without me warning D as if I am 14 and she is my Mum. It is also important that when S stays over, we literally just stay in my room except for going to the bathroom. We do not disturb my other flatmates at all, we aren't even noisy. 

&#x200B;

It all came to a head when this morning, me and S were leaving my house to drop S home and D caught a glimpse of S, at which point D shouted 'oh for fuck's sake' and slammed her bedroom door. Flatmate A said 'Hi' to S and that was that. I personally think this is very childish behaviour but I wanted to get some opinions on this. I could understand if me and S were always in the kitchen, in the lounge etc. but D literally saw S for one second and this was her reaction...

&#x200B;

I am graduating and leaving this flat for good in 5 days and will probably never see D again so I do not really care what D thinks of me. Ideally, I would prefer not to leave on bad terms considering we have been good friends for the last couple of years but am not willing to appease D's ridiculous behaviour in order to finish on good terms."

bvkybz	2019-06-01 13:46:02	krakk3rjack	AITA of thinking of taking legal action against the people that raised me? (Need to vent)	" 

Quick back story. My parents died before I turned 11. Left 3 kids behind, myself, younger brother and older sister. My Dad’s brother’s looked after us, though my Aunt (Dad’s sister) was officially our guardian. They were well off financially. They put us through school and uni for myself. We went everywhere with them and for the most part felt loved. When I left uni I asked about seeing my father’s will. Long story short I never got to see it and I didn’t even get the name of the lawyers that handled the paperwork. I forgot about the issue after about a year of being stonewalled.

Two years ago we found out that his estate has not being wound up and has death duties and lawyer related fees to the estate amounting to about US$10k. Family would not not give us a straight answer as to why.

Three weeks ago our Aunt passed away. A week ago, our sister was sorting through her stuff and came upon a box of paperwork. It contained our father’s will and life insurance policy. Today I got to read it, finally. Our childhood home was rented for nearly 17years. We never saw any of the proceeds. The will stated that the money go into a trust account for my brother, sister and I, managed by our uncle. He was to set it up as well. As appointed executors they never once told us anything about that. My Dad’s company’s machines were sold a year after he passed. I recall my Aunt saying they will put the money away for my sister as she was 16 and will need it when she leaves school. She never saw a cent. My father’s life insurance policy was sufficient to cover any debts he had and pay for the finalisation of his estate.

I know my father’s estate was mismanaged and I want to get my uncles to admit to that and pay for what they did. At the same time, they raised us and cared for us and maybe they used to money as payment for our upbringing. I’m feeling like shit, because for years I felt that maybe my Dad owed them and they didn’t want to burden us with that knowledge and were protecting us from that, so I let them get away with not yielding to my requests. Now I see that’s not the case. I tried talking on the phone but I got the you’re being ungrateful and that’s in the past shit and it's made me angry.

My brother and I are handling the matter of the estate and don’t need assistance, but in principle, it was never our our issue to deal with. What to do and would I be an asshole for going after them legally?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bvkwmi	2019-06-01 13:40:55	LeahWestfall	AITA 10 metre dog lead for my rescue?	" 

Two years ago my family and I adopted a rescue Akita, she had major issues when we got her, shelter never warned us of. She was terrified of everyone and aggressive to dogs. 2 years later (and lots of specialist training) she's improved loads, is totally chill with humans, albeit a bit weary and we are working on the other dogs. 

Because she is huge and needs loads of exercise we have her on a ten-metre leash. This allows her to run around more.  Whenever I see another dog in the distance I call Akira back to me and give her a doggy chocolate (She's addicted to them and she will always listen to me when I've got one of those!) then I hold her at heel as we walk by and she's fine. Owners usually get the message when I have my dog to heel and will either call their dog closer to them or leash them. This has helped with my dog's training loads as she's getting used to being around other dogs. 

That leads me to today. I usually walk with a cane but I've been doing well so I did the hike today.  We were on some backcountry paths when a spaniel come rushing round. Seeing this I get my dog right to me and sitting. I look to the owner who is in sight but on his phone. He's not watching his dog at all, I call out ""My dog's not too friendly"" but he's absorbed in his phone. I put my hand out, the spaniel stops a foot away from me. At this point, I call out again louder. Nothing. My dog cannot cope with a strange dog that close to her and she's crying and trying to pull loose. I have her at my knee nearly in a headlock comforting her. I have some control over the situation but the spaniel is straight up teasing my dog, and the owner hasn't even noticed.  This could easily descend into my dog snapping at this dog if I didn't keep careful control. After 30 seconds which felt like an eternity, I yell rather loudly at this man to call his dog back now, and I was very angry when I yelled it. I had to do something because my dog was getting more and more stressed. 

He eventually walks by me clearly in no rush and grabs his dogs collar, still on the phone muttering that if my dog isn't friendly she should be on a short leash quite petulant and angry himself. I quickly walked away for the sake of my dog and distracted her with some chocolate drops because she did do really well in that situation, I was proud of her. 

It made me wonder am I an asshole for using the longer lead? It significantly improves walks and I purposefully take a path we hardly see other dogs at.  The only time we've had issues is when other people don't control their dogs,  I don't blame the spaniel, he just wanted to play. Do I have a moral responsibly to close leash my dog to avoid potential issues? Even though in this instance she was at heel long before the spaniel reached us? Legally I am totally in the right I know, but you can be legally in the right and still an asshole.

After this, I asked her not to message or talk to her for the rest of the day so we could spend time together, she agreed. A couple hours later she messaged her, which made me feel like shit that she couldn’t even go a couple of hours without messaging this girl. I got upset about this and instead of talking to me about it or consoling me she just went to sleep. AITA for being upset?		1	0

so this all started a few months ago, me, my friend (H) and his friend (J) decided to see a movie, H ended up never making it as he slept through his alarm (he decided to stay up untill 3 in the morning and our movie was at 11) me and J decided to see the move as we had gotten here and figured it would be a waste to just leave. 
we had an absolute blast and decided to hang out again. 

we let H know that we where going out and he said he would come but slept through it again. we hung out again and had a blast. 
we then started seeing movies more regularly and finding new places to explore. 
we would hang out once or twice every week. 

H found out that me and J where hanging out without him and was obviously mad at us, he thinks that its unfair we never invite him and he now thinks I stole a friend from him. J would rather hang with me then H now. 


some extra info.
H and J have been friends for 6 years now, they met at high school.
I'm not attracted to or want to date J, that's not my motive. 
we are all 18.

It was one of those work holiday visas and I had a great time and met my ex there. At the end though we broke up due to my visa being close to expire and frankly I was glad to go home as my grandfather was quite ill at the time (he's better now). When I got back to my home country I discovered that I was pregnant. I told my ex who was thrilled at the pregnancy but disappointed that I would not return to be with him and that I would be giving birth in my home country and that our child would be raised here. He came over for the birth and I won't lie it was great to see him. But our lives are in different directions. We are both attached to our home countries  and he doesn't qualify to move here (visa issues plus he has his own business) and I prefer my country as all of my family are here.

&#x200B;

He has wanted me to visit with our kid for awhile so his family can meet them. I have no issues with his family but the problem is he is only offering to pay for half of the airfares for our child. I would have to pay the other half as well my own airfare and take time off to see him, deal with toddler on 15+ hour flight plus additional travel time such as getting to the airport, customs etc, accommodation, food and spending money) and while I can afford to do so I don't see the point in it as our child is only 2 1/2 and therefore our child is not going to remember seeing them and would rather spend the money elsewhere. To me, it would be best to wait until our son is at least eight or thirteen years old as this visit really only benefits his side of the family."		1	0

bvksx4	2019-06-01 13:29:42		WIBTA if I told my friend I couldn’t handle listening to her talk about nothing for hours at a time?	"My best friend—let’s call her Carly—and I have been close since high school, known each other since middle school. But we are complete opposites. Most importantly, I think about what I say before I say it. Carly needs to talk through her thoughts in order to put them in order. 

We live far apart now, and we used to call each other all the time, but there’s another difference: I work shifts 4am-12pm, she often works shifts 4pm-12am. So it’s almost like living in a different time zone than her sometimes.

Luckily, we came up with an easy solution.  
iMessage has a feature that allows you to send 1-minute voice messages, so we use those for anything that’s too long to be in text form. At first, it was an easy way to update the other about our day. We sent 3 or 4 at a time, and it was nice to hear her voice. But it has quickly gotten out of hand. 

Carly is completely abusing the system. Even though the frequency of my own messages hasn’t changed, she now sends me 10 on a good day, and on her worst day she’s sent me up to 40-50. That’s right, almost an *hour* of listening to her talk without being able to respond in any way. The last straw was this morning. I saw that she’d sent me about 20 of them last night, so I figured she had something important to say, or something had gone wrong at work. 

Nope. At the 3 minute mark, she explicitly says “I don’t really have anything to say”. AND THEN SHE CONTINUES FOR 17 MORE. I feel bad telling her to cool it, because I know she misses me and we tell each other everything. She’s always so happy that we have this system and are supportive of each other. But I’m going crazy. It’s so hard to dedicate so much time just to listening to her talk, without being in an actual phone call. WIBTA if I told her to chill out?"	Not the A-hole	1	0

bvkr4w	2019-06-01 13:23:59	FrostyYesterday	AITA For Moving Out Without Prior Notice..??	"Edit: wow this got more comments than expected, thank you all so much for your support. I'll get around to answering the comments when Im on PC. Thanks again

From where I am from, it's very normal to live with your parents until you've married. Unless you've found a job or school far away, you don't really move out if your parents' house. Basically, both Children feel entitled to this and parents to their children.


Now the main reason I moved out was because of the lack of privacy I've had in my room. Not only was it used as a storage space for clothes and etc, but my Mom would always be snooping around. ( other reasons include getting shit for staying out late, couldn't being friends or dates over, my Christian dad gives me shit for not going to church, etc. )


I have asked her on multiple occasions throughout the years to please stay out of my room and even broke down in front of her crying because it stressed me out, but it didn't stop. She'd always make an excuse to go in there.


I told her once that I really think I should move out soon for ""school"" reasons. It's my final year in University, I should be as close to my school as possible because all the lab equipment is there, and I have a lot of stuff to move back and forth. She didn't take that very nicely, told my dad, who basically sneered at me. So obviously, they weren't going to give me their consent. But, I felt that it was far past time to move out.


So I did so without telling them beforehand. I packed up my stuff one morning and left.


When they found out, there was hysteria. My mom was basically screaming ""how could you do this to us"" and my dad was saying things along the lines of ""you're not my son."" Telling them the reason, of course, did not work; it exacerbated things..


I basically planned a prison break because I knew they'd never give me permission to move out, despite having legally been an adult for years now

bvkqyv	2019-06-01 13:23:26	katannlew	AITA for wanting to distance myself from my family?	"I am 32. My mom passed away when I was 18 from a slow growing benign brain tumor we didn’t know about for 8 to 10 years. By the time she was diagnosed, it was 3 inches in her frontal lobe. Even before her death, our family had issues. 

My brother (2 yrs older) has a history of problems and spent time in a pediatric psychiatric hospital. As an adult he has been jailed. My brother has physically abused me; throwing me into doors and has tried to run me over with a car. I completely cut him off from my life many years ago. Last summer he was arrested for trying to run my uncle over with his car. Despite this, my dad stands by brother’s innocence!

I’m constantly walking on eggshells with my sister (possibly borderline personality). We only see each other once a year now. My dad blames me.

Now for my dad. In January he was over with my step mom and her grandson. My dad and step mom have been raising him since day 1 (now age 10). Anyway, my dad is in the process of selling my childhood home and said he wants to give away the family things to my sister, brother, and his wife. I was hurt that he mentioned I be in the same room with my brother; and that he mentioned my brother’s wife but not my husband. My husband then said “if he’s ever in the same room as (my brother) he would have a hard time not putting his hands on him.”

This led my dad to get in my husband’s face and shout “shut the fuck up” among other things in front of my son and step nephew. I tried to stop the arguing but my step mom egged it on more. We told them to leave. Communication with him since has been minimal. The few times we have talked have led into arguments. We have not seen each other in person. 

This event triggered me to take part in a lot of self reflection. There is too much history to cover, but basically I feel like my dad has always treated me as second string. He even treats my son as 2nd string to my step nephew. 

My son is now 17 months; but it’s been pulling teeth to get my dad to see him in the first 13 months. I was lucky if he came once a month. He often had other plans with his wife, her sick dad, or her grandson. A few times I made plans to take my baby to his house for a visit but he canceled because of my step nephew/stepmom. For my son’s 1st b-day my dad came an hour late. Then he left to take my step nephew to a birthday party that he didn’t want him to be late for!

Anyway, my dad FINALLY apologized to my husband after 4 months of me basically begging him to do so. I have not reached out to my step mom, but have received horrible texts from her. I finally blocked her number. She thinks I’m a judgmental person, but I think she’s jealous of my success. I have a phd and own a clinic; whereas her son dropped out of high school, struggles with drugs, and can’t support his son. 

I know we are arguing but my dad hasn’t asked to see his grandson in these last 4 months. This incident for me has been an eye opener and I’m tired of everything.

"At my university (this is in Europe, if that affects judgement) the bathrooms have four 'cubicles' with full walls and doors (not stalls) and one large 'cubicle' type room for anyone with a disability with the necessary requirements. All of these cubicles are accessed by the same entrance. The normal four bathrooms have two sinks opposite them but the sinks have very low and short motion automated faucets and the sink isn't a 'bowl' shape but instead a flat surface with a slant so the water drains.The disabled bathroom has a normal bowl sink and a handle for the faucet.

My university also doesn't have water fountains in this building, but the tap water is perfectly drinkable. So when I want to refill my bottle during the day, I use the tap in that 'cubicle'. I never go to the the bathroom in that room, I always leave the door open for the 30 seconds it takes me to fill my bottle (it is usually wide open anyway). I never wait to go in there if it is used and try to maneuver my bottle under the normal sinks.

I don't see a problem with me using the largely unused cubicle just to fill my water bottle, I leave the door open and I'm aware of the other people that are in the bathroom area. I've had a few comments saying that I should never use a disabled bathroom unless it is a life/death type of emergency. Some have been from people when they see me fill my bottle and say 'You know that's the disabled toilet right?' but then again I see other people fill their bottles there because it is just easier (and they also leave the door open).

I'm just genuinely curious  as to if I'm the asshole doing this or not. I don't see what the problem is if I'm aware of other people in the bathroom and I'm in there no more than a minute.

Edit: Just wanted to add this one building is the only place where I do it, I don't use disabled bathrooms anywhere else either."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"There are five of us in this particular friend group (female mid 20s) and we’ve been really close for about 10 years now. One of the girls has been dating this guy for a little over a year. 

In this time she’s gone on numerous vacations with him and his friends, she set up dinners and lunches with her other friends and colleagues to meet him officially, and hung out on the weekends with other couples. 

We all travel for work a lot, so we don’t see each often but probably 9-10 times in the past year. Not bringing him because of our quality girls’ time made sense for a while. Then at dinner one day, she brings him up in conversation really nonchalantly, “[boyfriend] loves that podcast too! You guys would get along great... but I don’t really want you guys to meet him because you’ll judge him”.  I argued about that being unfair to us but we got over it pretty quickly. 

Last night my boyfriend (they’ve all met him) had some friends over for dinner. I sent a photo of our food into our group chat captioned “finally a grown up” since I never cook. And she accuses me of excluding my friends. That this is why she doesn’t want to introduce her boyfriend to us, because we would never include him in anything. 

We know he exists, we have mutual friends and they post photos together. I was pretty annoyed about her having a separate life for the last year, after last night I’m downright angry. She’s back in the chat being completely normal but I haven’t gotten over it. Am I the asshole?"	No A-holes here	1	0

For the sake of convenience I'll call him Mike. We're pretty close, but there's something he does that irritates me to no end. Everything he does, he believes has to be super top secret, so he's a little too eager to kick me out of mundane things. An example would be when he kicked me out of his room to talk to his high school friends about high school things. I'm not sure what he thought I would do with info about a bunch of people I don't know from a time that should be behind us. But as dumb as I thought his requests were, I knew it wasn't my place to decide that and left. However, there are times where I draw the line; recently was one of those times.

We have a mutual friend (22M) I'll call Dave and the three of us usually hang out in Dave's room. They're both gay and Mike has romantic feelings for Dave. We were all hanging out in Dave's room and watching a show on my laptop. As soon as Dave and I were starting to really get into the show, Mike starts dropping hints that I should leave so he can spend time with Dave alone. I refused because it's not his room, it's Dave's room and if he still wants me there I'm staying. Not only that, but as far as I know Dave doesn't feel the same way so I would be getting kicked out for a fruitless effort. Later, he told me I should take a hint and leave when asked. I told him I got the hint, I just didn't listen because I didn't think it was fair for him to cut my time with Dave short just because he has a crush. If he wants alone time, he should do it on his own time, not when it's a group hangout in a place he doesn't own.

But despite those reasons, I still feel like I was just being a defiant little shit. AITA?

EDIT: I decided to clarify something. In the past when Mike has asked me to leave, he wants me to leave for good. I assumed this time was no different, since he didn't tell me to ""step outside"", he told me to ""leave"". This was also why I was insistent on staying because I knew I wouldn't have been able to come back, and if Dave still wanted me around that wouldn't have been fair to either of us."

Technically she wasn't my immediate boss but she was my bosses boss. She was only like 50 but had a stroke at home and fell down the stairs. She broke her spine, neck, was in a coma and was on life support for 2 days before they pulled the plug and she died. 

This death, like most, was sudden and unexpected and people at my job started wearing black ribbons on their uniforms. A coworker saw that I did not have one on mine and offered me one, to which I replied ""no thanks"" and received a few glares from other coworkers in the area.

He has become more secretive and is does not really seem to really care about me as what a normal friend would do. He prioritises other friends above me and I often feel left out in his life unless he needs me. It has been bothering me a lot because I feel like I'm the one who is always giving but he does little to reciprocate my actions. It has been something that has been bugging me but I choose to not think much about it because I do not really feel comfortable about giving evaluations about my friendships. It also does not help that I really feel uncomfortable talking about this with him and I am afraid he would see me as being weird or push me further away

From his point of view, I know he is someone who is easily influenced/attached to people. He tends to take a back seat/play a supporting role in the many relationships he is in with people. He has a lot more friends than me so I can see how it would be difficult for him to maintain all these relationships simulataneously.

What irritates me is that he constantly texts people when we are supposed to be spending time together  exclusively and hides a lot of things for me. I also dislike how he occasionally is not honest with himself and his actions."	No A-holes here	0	0

bvkbgm	2019-06-01 12:31:31	Navy_Eagle	AITA for how I treated my classmate?	"Backstory: There is a mentally disabled classmate of mine in my Latin class and I don’t really like him (NOT BECAUSE HE’S MENTALLY DISABLED). I say disabled, because I don’t know if he’s just autistic or if he has something else. I don’t know what other mental disabilities he has. I think reasons for not liking him is for valid reasons though. 

He constantly harasses/sexually harasses the girls (including me sometimes) in our class if he is sitting next to a girl. If he is sitting next to a girl, he rocks back-and-forth to subtly rub his d*ck. He claims some girls are his “girlfriend” and that he has 7 “girlfriends”. This makes all the women (and even the men) in our class very uncomfortable especially if they are forced to sit next to him.

He also gets very annoyed easily and whenever someone is joking amongst their friends, he covers his ears and/or yells very loudly at them, or just have some kind of over-the-top reaction. He constantly holds up class by trying to ask a question, but rants about what we just said before asking the actual question. However, the staff never tried to correct his behavior because he is disabled and they say “he can’t help it”.

These are the reasons why I have a distain for him.

Main Event: He has recently started targeting these two girls who are friends. He always sits in front of me and the two girls have to travel far from the previous class so they are always forced to take the two seats that happen to be next to him in the row in front of me. 

The girls, L and C, are constantly harassed by him. L has previously been harassed by him and he has said he has loved her, grabbed her hand, and he’s just been really creepy with her despite her protest and said she has a boyfriend. He has even created a timeline of them being together after she breaks up with her boyfriend (her and her boyfriend are still together). 

C is usually the one that sits next to him. He constantly tries to talk to her while she does her work, tries to touch her hair or arm, and I caught him staring at her, but not her face, he was staring at her boobs. 

After having enough of this, I told him in a stern voice, “Leave them alone. They are trying to do their work and you are keeping them from doing that. You are making them uncomfortable and it is also rude to stare.” He seemed slightly embarrassed and said sorry before leaving them alone and went back to rocking back and forth. C didn’t know he was staring at her boobs and thanked me. I have switch seats with her so she can still be by her friend and I sit next to him because he doesn’t really bug me. (He’s 17 and we are all in the range of 15-17. I’m 15 and L and C are 16 or 17).

**EDIT: Just to clarify, we have tried talking to the teacher about it. However, we were told that he’s mentally disabled, so he can’t help it.**

**EDIT 2: I am getting everyones replies and I am reading them all. Thank you for your answers. I have read them! :D**

**EDIT 3: When Reading the comments, I got the impression that you guys thought he was only harassing these two girls. Nope, he has harassed every girl in our class (including me) except for 1 (she has short hair, so I think he thinks she is a boy). The last time he harassed me was during the middle of spring, when I was forced to sit next to him and caught him staring on the day I was wearing my white Lululemon skort. I caught him and said “What do you think you’re doing?” He didn’t answer and looked away. The reason why I fell I might be TA this time is because the incident didn’t happen to me, but to someone else (L and C), and I felt like it might not of been any of my business to but in.**"	Not the A-hole	0	0

A few weeks later she began dating a giant meathead who has serious issues with relationships. She began texting me, asking me to state that we hadn’t been together nor had we engaged in any physical activity. I complied at first, as we hadn’t even seen each other since high-school, thinking it might end their issues. She continued to text me saying rude things, asking weird questions and demanding screenshots of our discussions, which I did not have. This continued for several weeks, regardless of whether I responded. 

A month later the now ex-boyfriend took/stole her phone & began texting me, threatening me and demanding I tell the truth, even going as far as bringing up my deceased best-friend as “something to swear on”. That angered me, so I asked to be completely left alone as I have nothing to do with the situation between them. The girl then contacts me to try to “explain” herself  and I refused to answer to keep to my plan to not engage anymore. 

She has since called me 30+ times over several days, using several phones and No Caller ID numbers, many of which I have continually blocked. The worst is that she went to my deceased friend’s parent’s and made them attempt to contact me, knowing I might pick up their calls.

Nothing very serious but he needs regular checkups and I'm always there with him. He started seeing a new consultant cardiologist last week and seeing her name and face was shocking for me. 

Her name is Rebecca and she went to school with me. She made my life hell from day 1. She was pretty so everybody liked her. She got boys to threaten me just to impress her, just so she could scare and humiliate me, she told me I was ugly and stupid and that I would be a virgin for the rest of my life. She also almost got me expelled from school by putting her weed in my bag when the police came to check everyone. 

I wasn't sure if it was her or if the name was the same, but when she walked in it was definitely her. Even more gorgeous. She gave me a smirk just like she used to do and proceeded with the checkup. When everything seemed to be OK and it was over and she was asking my dad questions about his lifestyle and such and he confirmed he was living with me, and she then asked me ''And you're *single* I take it''. She smirked at me while saying this. When the questions were done she headed off. 

My dad knows and remembers who she is, and it was difficult when I admitted that I would rather he was seen by somebody else. Google her, and you'll see that she has a stellar reputation. Understandably my dad wants to be treated by the most capable person, and unfortunately that's her. Obviously there are other good cardiologists around but the fact is Rebecca is one of the best in the country. 

My dad has been very understanding and hasn't treated me like an AH, but I feel like I'm being childish and petty because I don't want to see her smug face when we go to the hospital, even though she is the most capable person to trust with my dad's care."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We end up at this rowdy bar a bit far out (30-40min) which I recommended. It was good fun until she sees someone she knows, this guy she went to college with, and they start chatting. I awkwardly try to join in but I’m basically ignored. I leave them to it to get some food and come back like 30 min later. They’re still chatting. I stand around like an idiot trying to join the convo but at one point the guy literally blocks me out with his back and my date says and does nothing. They back into a corner and only talk to each other. 

At this point I go out and grab a smoke. She comes out after me and apologizes, says she hasn’t seen this guy in ages. I tell her that’s cool but I’m just gonna head home soon. She asks me to wait for her bc she doesn’t have a ride and it’s far from home. 

So I wait bc whatever, night is ruined and I might as well just hang out. I wait another 20 min before heading back inside to tell her I’m going home and she can either come with me or stay. I see them in the same corner with the guy blocking my view. I try to talk to her but he keeps turning to block me away. I gesture to her that I’m going and she holds up a finger like “wait a minute” and instead of coming to talk to me she just keeps talking to her friend. 

I’ve had it at this point and I just text her “leaving now, bye” and head straight to my car and leaves. I get frantic calls about 15 min later. She asks me where I am and if I could go back and pick her up since she doesn’t have a ride and her friend doesn’t live close to her like I do. I say “no” and hang up. 

Anyways the next day I get the longest, angriest chain of texts in my life. She’s upset because I left her with no ride and she had to beg the bartender to call her a cab because she ran out of cash and can’t get uber/lyft for some reason. She calls me a POS and to never call her again and that she’ll be telling anyone she knows not to ever go on a date with me.

bvk6hj	2019-06-01 12:13:56	_vincec	AITA for calling out my friend?	"(On mobile)

So almost every girl in my school posted some kind of political thing on there story when the new Alabama abortion law came out, they were all against it and my friend who we can call A did the same. So A posted something on her story and we talk a lot and she knows I’m republican (I do not support the bill though). 

So I’m at dinner with a friend and we were talking about it and I was like, “I’m surprised A didn’t post anything ha”, and he was like oh yes she did. So he shows me and I don’t care what people think so I think nothing but then I realized that I couldn’t see it not on my one Instagram but also my second one.

This leads me to think that she hid it from me, so fast forward to Thursday and we are FaceTiming and talking about the bill. She bought it up and I asked her why I couldn’t see her story on my account. She said that she got a dm which got her hacked and all. I said that well then what are the chances it would effect it for both of my accounts? And then I said “something just isn’t adding up here”.

She took that as I thought she was lying, now this isn’t something she wouldn’t do, and also I get the feeling she tells white lies sometimes too not to be mean but just to not deal with stuff. 

She then got all offended and said stuff like “this is why you don’t have a gf” and then just hung up.

bvk1vk	2019-06-01 11:57:06	solidwilly	AITA for kissing my ex's best friend?	"So, 16.5M and about 4 months ago I broke up with my ex-girlfriend who at the time I had been dating for 11 months. Nothing bad happened, I guess we started changing and drifting apart and it hadn't felt right for a while. We've been on good terms pretty much the whole time since the breakup but we don't talk much.

About two months ago after a party she hooked up with one of my friends (I assume this is typical high-school drama). When I found out I flared at her, then apologized sincerely the next morning for being so mad but after that I wasn't really talking to her. I have nothing against her for that decision, I'm kind to both of them still.

Note: I decided a week or two after that night that by December (tickets booked, dec 02) to move back to England where I was born to live indefinitely.

Fast forward to last night. We were at a party (about 60 people, ex+friend included), alcohol involved if it makes a difference. A friend of hers was there (She has a lot of friends, most girls that were there I would consider a friend of hers). Both her and my ex knew of my plans to move, so they both knew I wasn't getting into any long term relationships. I like her and she seems to flirt a lot with me. When most people had already left the party, we went into the living room (away from everyone and out of sight) and one thing led to another, hence the title. That's all that happened. I haven't told anyone.

Today I get a message from my ex asking if I ""hooked up"" with her friend. I tell her we kissed and she started berating me over message about how I lost her trust and how she thinks I did it just to get back at her.

I can see where she's coming from, I suppose she has right to be mad, but I never meant to cause drama and I didn't expect her to even be mad about it. She said she thinks I did it ""just so that she would find out"". Finally she says that she can't believe I would do that to her with her ""best friend"". I don't talk to my ex about her friends and I never see her around and I've barely talked to her ""best friend""; I had no idea they were ""best friends"".

There wasn't a doubt in my mind I was doing anything wrong, but I'm starting to wonder if I've been TA all along.

bvjxrh	2019-06-01 11:40:08		AITA for not wanting to go halfies on a trip with my bf?	We've been dating for 8 months or so, last 4 of which have been a LDR. I knew my schedule from the very beginning of the year and said I could take 2 weeks in june off but I needed to give my boss a 2 week heads up. He asks his boss 2 months before we want to go on vacation. He waits until the day of to give me the okay to put in my time off request. Because of this, lodging is 2x as expensive as it would have been if I could have booked it one month ago, let alone two. I was going to cover the hotel and car but now it's 2x the price so he offered to split it, I said yes to the hotel but I'll cover the car. So now we are days away from our trip and he still has not bought his plane tickets. They are nearly 3x the original price. It'll end up costing me about $1000(car, snacks, half of lodging) at this point, he'll pay $1700 (flight+half of lodging). WIBTA if I didn't offer to cover half his flight? This whole trip is going to be about, if not more than 2x the cost it should have been. Plus I've booked the hotel, car, found all the restaurants, things to do, etc because he has been unable to get reliable cell service for the past two months (every 3 days or so for a few hours). I'm just frustrated at this point and I don't know if this is me being petty or not. We make about the same income if that matters. Thanks!	Not the A-hole	1	0
bvjxom	2019-06-01 11:39:47	bluntSwordsSuffer	AITA for asking my house mate to talk about her sex life in her room?	"Me and my housemate were very close. I developed feelings for her and, unfortunately those feelings weren’t reciprocated. Things like this hit me particularly hard and when your living with the person it’s even harder. One of the problems is that she speaks French a lot and I speak French; but not fluently. After an incident in which I thought she was talking about me on the phone I had to apologise profusely for getting things wrong. She suggested that we had to take some kind of action for the next incident like this. The action being that I communicate with her what is going on next time I feel that way. 

 A few days ago I come home from work and enter the living room. She is having a loud conversation in French so I threw on my headphones. Old David Letterman didn’t drown it out and I started to hear all about a sexual encounter she had had in excruciating detail for about an hour. It included her telling her friend that she would never sleep with a non-native french speaker because the language is so important to seduction. 

Every now and then she would say “I can’t say it over the telephone. He can overhear.” then giggling she would disappear out into the hall to continue talking just as loudly. She later confirmed to me that I hadn’t mixed up anything she had been saying.

 Eventually I said to her “hey listen I’m sorry but even with this turned up loud I can hear what your saying and you know me I half understand french and get things wrong. Would you mind if its not too much trouble going to your room if your going to have a very private conversation?” She acted totally fine with it and as she left I apologised to whomever she was calling. 

 Later that day however she ignored my messages asking her to come down and smoke a bowl and was very angry that I had asked her to leave. Its been 6 days and the whole situation has just gone from bad to worse. 

  What makes this worse in my opinion is that three days earlier she told me about fucking some guy in english. I didn’t say anything and just acted like it didn’t bother me but she herself said that she could see it really upset me. 

The house is divided on this issue; with some saying I was wrong to say anything and others saying she was wrong to have that kind of conversation in a shared space.

 TLDR; my housemate turned friend turned unrequited love interest asked me to tell her if the things she was saying over the phone in french were upsetting me because I speak the language but sometimes get things wrong. She started describing fucking a guy she met for over an hour and was very angry when I asked her if she would mind having that conversation in another room.

bvjw5n	2019-06-01 11:33:18	Meddie90	AITA for cutting a line to a machine no one else was using?	"A while back me and my partner traveled to London for the weekend. We arrived by train and I needed to top up my Oyster card (a pre-paid travel card you use for the underground and buses). I went to the self service machines while my partner waited nearby and it looked something like \[this\]([https://imgur.com/a/G9yiwHp](https://imgur.com/a/G9yiwHp)) (apologies for the terrible sketch). 

The queue was 2/3 full, about 30-40 people long and served 10 or so machines built into the wall. An attendant was bouncing between the machines helping people with their cards but for whatever reason nearly half of the machines towards the far side of the queue exit were going unused. I guess this was because a significant majority of the line were non-English speaking tourists so wanted they to get a machine near the attendant so he could help them. Also the ones at the end were card only so maybe the tourists only had cash?

I figured I'd wait to see if anyone wanted to use them but after around 20 seconds the line had moved a few places but a bunch of end machines were still unoccupied so... why not just walk up and use them? I wasn't taking a machine anyone else wanted and it seemed silly to join the line just to wait for no reason. I went to the farthest machine, topped up my card and a few people in the queue gave me a dirty look, I think one even tutted. 

Within 30 seconds I was done and headed back to my partner and who looked embarrassed. On the underground I asked her why and she told me I shouldn't have cut in line and that It was rude. I said there was no point in waiting and there were still 3 free machines next to me that remained un-used but she still said I should have gotten in line. 

I've pondered on it for a while, I'm from the UK and improper queuing etiquette might lead to me being disowned. AITA for cutting in line? Or was it reasonable to go to one of the unused machines. 

Edit: thanks for the replies. It might be worth giving a little extra info to clarify some stuff.

1. The attendant probably should have been directing people to the machines but was so busy with the wave of tourists he was probably too busy to care/notice me cutting the line. 

2. The 4 or so people giving me glares didn’t have suitcases and spoke in a southern accent so we’re probably locals. The tourists who were grinding the line to a halt didn’t bat an eyelid."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bvjucq	2019-06-01 11:26:10	guayabilla	AITA for letting my dogs bark at the park	"Yesterday I had plans to meet a friend at a park in her town, I brought my two dogs with me and sat on a bench for about 20 minutes until she arrived. My dogs are not well trained and bark when they see other dogs or sometimes at strangers walking close to us. The dogs grew up in a very rural area where we rewarded them for alerting us to strangers on the property. They are not aggressive at all and if a stranger approaches and is friendly they will stop barking and wag their tails. 

About fifteen minutes into my wait a woman approached yelling at me and threatening to call the police because my dogs were ""disturbing the peace"". She told me to leave the park. I tried to explain that I was waiting for a friend and it would just be a few minutes. I held my position, but now I feel like maybe I was TA because they were barking. It didn't help matters that the dogs were barking incessantly at this yelling woman.

I don't bring my dogs to other public places, they're not the types who will sit calmly outside a coffee shop, but I always felt like a park, even a crowded park was ok.  Should I have left them home? Should I have backed down and walked them somewhere else when the woman complained?"	Asshole	0	0

I do not like this woman at all! Everything about her irks me. Not only do I not like her as a person but I think she’s a gold digger. I mean my bil is not rich but he has a well paying job, nice home, nice car, etc... We also have nothing in common. She loves reality tv & is obsessed with the Kardashians. Something that to me is honestly a deal breaker. Sorry not sorry. Ok so when my bil comes over he obviously brings her. I’m forced to sit through dinner & drinks & have a conversation with this woman who as I said I don’t like or have anything in common with. I don’t mind doing it every once in a while. I mean we’re family & I have to make some sacrifices. I’m sure my husband doesn’t like my asshole sister but he tolerates her at family events. Ok but they want to come over every weekend! Like every Friday night my husband wants to go out for dinner with them or have them over for a bbq or go out for brunch on Sundays. My husband & bil are really close & I get it but I can’t take another moment with his wife. I finally told my husband that I don’t want them here every weekend. That maybe one a month is ok & to limit it to about 2 hours. Or meet them for an hour for a meal somewhere once a month. I’m sorry but why am I being forced to spend time with someone I don’t want to or like? That’s my thought. My husband is obviously upset. My mom thinks I’m an asshole. Idk what to think anymore. At first I was sure I had a good reason & now idk. My time is precious. I work & go to school & the last thing I want is to spend my free time doing shit I don’t want.  I’ve even suggested that when they come over I can leave & he can say I’m busy with school or something & my husband says it’s rude because then who is she going to talk to. So my question is AITA for asking this of my husband because honestly I think he’s the asshole. Idk I keep going back & forth on who really is the asshole.	Asshole	1	0

So ever since I was very young, my parents have always offered to give me the house when the time comes and they'd move to our summer home. Well that time had come however the problem is that neither my boyfriend or me are fans of the current furniture in the house and therefore would like to sell most of it and just throw some of it away. This has completely infuriated my dad especially and now he has no idea what to do. He's even considering buying a whole new place to keep all the stuff in. I  don't see this as rational  behaviour but then again at the end of the day, he is doing me a solid by giving me the house and they are his possessions after all. I just don't want to live in a house where I don't have the  freedom to renovate and make my own. My parents have shown hoarder behaviour in the past  but in this situation, I don't know if they're right and I shouldn't get rid of their stuff or if I have a right to  want to make the house my own.

So I’ve been struggling with dyslexia and ADHD for the better part of my life (unknown until last year), not really doing much. I did get and am currently in law school, so I don’t think I failed in that sort of way, but just reaching for something that’s always outside of my grasp.

Recently (2 months ago) I decided to seek actual support in the form of CBT and medication as well as asking the school for more support in exams. 

The medication has worked wonders and I see clearly what I am, who I am now and where I’m going. But I feel the scars from underachieving in things I wanted to do and go? Relationships lost and opportunities passed up. 

Am I the asshole, for joining Mensa (applicable) just for me? So I can feel some validation in myself so I can move forward and feel like I wasn’t such a waster ? I know Mensa has such a petty attitude towards others and themselves as portrayed in social media, but I feel like I want to just achieve this accolade. To say to myself “hey you’re smart, you were just being held down, Stop being so hard on yourself?” Or am I an asshole for wanting to join a club that is elitist?

I’d appreciate if you could leave the stigma of Mensa out of your thought and focus on the reasoning I’m doing it, thanks :)"		1	0
bvjsw6	2019-06-01 11:20:19		AITA for being mad at my best friend?	"Ok, so... I have a big crush on a girl I've known for a while and I have crafted a little ""plan"" to tell her my feelings and it goes like this:

I invite her and my friend to the Museum of Art (she told me before that she would like to go there). We take a tour, you know the drill, and then my friend excuses himself and says he has to go because he is gonna meet with his girlfriend. After he leaves... it's the perfect time to tell her.

The reason he has to come is because I do not want to make it look like it is a date, and I think we would all be more comfortable this way.


Now here is the problem. He says he is gonna do it if either:

- his girlfriend comes with us too  or
- he tells his girlfriend the entire plan

And I do not agree with any of these two. The  truth is... I do not know his girlfriend that well and I certainly do not have the necessary trust to tell her this secret. I tell him this and he says she won't do anything and she definitely needs to know, because she has to know that he is spending time with me not because he doesn't love her, but because it is a well established ""plan"". I then reply that it is simply none of her bussiness, and that he is gonna spend time with her anyways right after he leaves. He continued arguing and ultimately said that he is not gonna help me and I should pick someone else.

Now I am really mad at him. I really needed his help and now I feel that he would rather break the boundaries of our trust and my privacy just so his girlfriend knows where he is at. Maybe I am overreacting... I don't know.

"So basically one of my friends (F21) pointed out she doesn't feel like talking with me (F22) when I make some of my realistic comments, which for her sound quite negative. I told her it's okay; she could just stop talking with me and I would not blame her.

This pretty much sums up the situation. When I told her that she was like ""oh that's not very helpful "". She knows I am depressed, she might as well understand it affects my capability of interacting in a ""happy"" way with people or even judging if a situation is good or bad. I don't care if she sees it or not, but I love her and prefer her to stay away if I am being toxic. But it does sound cold from my part.

The comments were quite general and addressed topics such as college, love life, family issues, etc. Nothing crazy but I think we are both struggling and I don't want her to be blind about it and act like everything will work out.

"So we’ve been together for 4-5 years, lived together for three and we have a two year old. Money’s been tight since I’m the only one working since a few months before our daughter was born. Only debt we have is hers from before, my cars are paid for hers we currently owe more then it’s worth, she has student loans for a degree she never used and other debts. 

Yesterday was my birthday and literally all she did was send me a short happy birthday text while I was at work ( a 13 hr shift even) like a couple Snapchat happy birthday characters. My sister called and asked if we were doing anything and if not she could come over to babysit so we could get dinner or something. Long story short she was napping at 6 pm along with our kid. Way to late of a nap time when 8pm is usually bedtime. Finally calls me back a little after 7 and we decide to get dinner nearby and a beer. 

She didn’t get me a single thing, no card no cake nothing. Like I said money’s tight but she won’t even flinch to spend 300 a month on coffee and cigarettes. And it’s all my money since she won’t work. Honestly I at least figured I’d get a special birthday “gift” of sex. Nope. Kid was up screaming till 1130 at night and I work at 6 am the following day. 

So I’m pretty upset by this. I’m either going to completely ignore her birthday this year or tell her off when I get home from work and go out with my friends with out her. I’m just pretty disappointed that a few of my friends I hardly see were able to wish me a happy birthday through text  much nicer then she bothered to do..."		1	0

I know this might make me sound bratty, but in comparison to others, I got way less of a celebration (I’m aware it’s not about the money, but I just wanted to point it out) and my parents keep telling me I’m spoiled, even though I didn’t have a party, get my hair done or anything big.

This has obviously caused a lot of grief for my family, especially my mother. My maternal grandpa has moved in with us since my grandma's passing. He likes to take long hot showers before bed, so my dad has encouraged him to shower earlier or everyone else is basically taking a cold shower. Now I wasn't actually physically present during this next part. This past Thursday night, my dad and my brother were watching the NBA finals at our family home. By 11:30pm, my dad noticed that my grandpa had still not showered. Having already told him many times to shower by 10:30pm in the past weeks, he got fed up and complained to my mom about it. This escalated into an argument. 

Yesterday, I hop on the bus to visit my family as I’m still at college. At this point, I’m unaware of the events of the previous night. I call my mom several times tell her when I'm arriving at the station, no answer. I text her my arrival time, no response. I call my dad instead, and he agrees to pick me up. When I arrive, I'm waiting there for my dad. To my surprise, it's actually my mom who pulls up in her car. I'm about to walk and get into her car when seconds later, I see my dad's car also pulling up in the distance towards the station. I'm thinking there was probably a miscommunication between my parents, resulting in both of them coming to pick me up. To indicate to my mom that my dad has also come, I start pointing towards his car. Before I even get a chance to approach my mom's car, she speeds off and leaves. Obviously, I get in my dad’s car and he tells me the events of the previous night

Now my mom often walks out on us whenever she's mad at someone in the family, so it's no surprise to me when we get home to find her gone. Usually, she'll come back home by the evening after having cooled down, but not today. By 12am, she's still not home. I got angry, texting her

""Mom, I don't know what's going on, but I want you to consider your own actions. In the past month, I have never once refused to answer your phone call to talk with you. I was surprised you came to pick me up today, I thought your phone died so I called dad instead. Now you refuse to pick up anyone’s call. Your own father is continuously calling you because he is worried and cannot sleep. Think about your actions. Are you being a mature person?""

We had all tried calling her to no avail. My grandpa was worried sick to the point of tears. At this point, my dad and I are worried about her physical safety given the recent loss of her mother. We file a missing person report and voice our fears that she may engage in a decision she would regret. The cops arrive and tell us they've found her, she's physically fine, but just doesn't want to come home. It's almost 7am at this point, no sign from her. To me, even given the loss of her mother over a month ago, this behaviour seems a little selfish and entitled. AITA?"	No A-holes here	1	0
bvjkc6	2019-06-01 10:47:30	R1senfrombelow	AITA the asshole if I made out with an friend’s ex the night they broke up	"My (M17) friend, lets call her Kate, (F17) had been going out with a my other friend, Steve, (M17) for about 3 weeks. Now for those reading who aren’t 17, you should know relationships at our age are often ‘childish’ and last only a couple weeks. I’d been friends with Steve for about 3 months and Kate for about the same (known them both for years though).

At the end of last year I was at a friends house for drinks, where about 10 people were present. Steve and Kate’s relationship had gone through a ‘rocky’ first three weeks and it was pretty clear that it wasn’t going to last; about halfway through the evening Kate announced to Steve in private that she thought it’d be better if they called it quits. This resulted in an awkward rest of the evening as neither of them decided to leave. Kate wasn’t in the best of moods after the break up however certainly wasn’t taking it as badly as Steve. Steve decided he’d call and invite his best female friend over in order to have a drink with him and comfort him. Mary, Steve’s friend, happens to be my ex girlfriend whom I had recently (a month before) broken up with after a long term relationship (2 years) and we weren’t exactly on speaking terms. This obviously annoyed me quite a lot however, I didn’t say anything at time, as I knew he wasn’t in the best mindset. Later, that evening everyone had left except myself (who was staying at the host’s house), Kate & the host (whom was of in their bedroom with someone else). Kate and myself, both reasonably drunk, were conversing in the living room where one thing lead to another and resulted in us making out. We both mutually realised this wasn’t a good idea as we didn’t want to ruin our friendship and she left to go home (we did not have sex).

Kate and I are both still friends, and are not interested in dating or hooking up again. Steve and I are both still friends, I told him what happened that night a couple months later and after a couple of days of avoiding me, he got over it and we’re friends again. (I would like to add that I have never been and am not super close with either of them; almost more like acquaintances).

Now you might be wondering why I am questioning if the asshole as all seems to have been resolved now, and that is because of my real friends. One of my very close friends expressed her extreme disappointment in me and to this day still feels I’m an asshole for what I did, however, another one of my very close friends feels I’m not an asshole and had every right to do what I did without feeling guilty as I wasn’t very close with Steve or Kate.

bvjjqe	2019-06-01 10:45:23	PurpleGamerWolf	WIBTA for cutting ties with an old friend who used to tease me romantically/sexually and now doesn't care about me?	"Background: I have known this person since Year 8 (about 14) and I'm 26 now. They helped me be social at school when I really wasn't and helped me when I had no where to live a couple years ago. As most people do, I fell deep into a crush with her during highschool. However, she never reciprocated, so we never dated.

But really, most of the time of our friendship has been her talking about how she is sexually frustrated, and occaisionally she'd say things like ""you know, I think about seeing what you're like in bed"" and stuff.

Then I went through a rough patch a few years ago, and I stayed over at her place. She requested some platonic cuddles, and I happily obliged, knowing exactly what was happening. I didn't fool myself into thinking she wanted anything.

But now I'm getting married next year. I have a child on the way with my favourite partner. And this friend? Couldn't care less.

So WIBTA if I didn't invite her to my wedding and just overall cut contact, considering she now doesn't seem to care about my life?

bvjixg	2019-06-01 10:42:36	Lsysce	WIBTA if I had my frozen sperm destroyed?	"So I (28m) have been having a lot of discussions/fights with my girlfriend (29f) lately. I will have to give you some background information for this to make sense.

Roughly 2 years ago I was diagnosed with brain cancer. They also found metastasis from the tumor all the way down my spine. I went through chemotherapy and radiation as a result. One possible side effect of the treatment was that I would become infertile. So I had my sperm frozen before the treatment just to be on the safe side and I really did become infertile. 

The problem is that I don't want to have biological children. I also suffer from major depression and my early 20s were absolutely awful as a result. It took me several years just to become a functioning member of society and I still go to therapy and take antidepressants to this day. There's also a history of depression in my family. My mom and my uncle have also been diagnosed with depression and they think that my grandmother also suffered from it.

Because of that I decided that I don't want to have biological children. I just don't want to see my children go through the same problem as I did. I know that wouldn't necessarily happen, but I don't want to take any chances. A large part of my life has been absolutely awful because of depression to the point where I was seriously thinking about taking my own lifefor many years.

Recently my girlfriend and I have been talking a lot about having children. I absolutely love her and definitely want to marry her and start a family with her, but I don't want to have biological children. I would be okay with either a sperm donor or adoption. She doesn't want either of these options though and definitely wants me to be the biological father of her children.

She says that just because depression has been a problem in my family that that doesn't mean my children will suffer from it, too. And while that is true I still don't want to take a chance. The thing is she never knew me when I my depression was really bad. We've known each other for three years and have been together for two years now.

A few days ago I mentioned that I'm thinking about getting rid of my frozen sperm. She immediately started crying and begged me to keep it. I 100% made up my mind on this topic though. I'm not going to have biological children with anyone. I think it's irresponsible and I couldn't live with myself if my children had to go through the same struggles as I did. I just don't see any reason why I should keep my sperm. It costs me ~300€ a year to keep it frozen. (It's frozen at - 196° C.) We're not struggling financially, but I've made up my mind on this topic and see no reason to keep it anymore.

So, WIBTA if I got rid of my frozen sperm and make it impossible for me to have biological children?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvjiuq	2019-06-01 10:42:20	BulkierSphynx1996	AITA for letting Endgame end a friendship?	"When Avengers Endgame came out me and my friends were pretty excited. Picture the scene; outside a pub on a cold British March night, loose plans were made to see it the Monday after it came out.

I was concerned that the tickets would sell out, so when I saw tickets were online, I bought 4 for me (A), my friend and his girlfriend (B+C) and my other friend (D). I did this without consulting any of them, be it to my downfall and something i definitely should have checked first. They didn't sell out in the end.

D wasn't free that day so couldn't take the ticket which I was honestly fine with, bully for me, my mistake.

B and C told me thanks, that was all good, if not a little surprised that I'd done it. However 20 minutes later, I got a message from B saying that ""We've got Showcase member cards so will try and get cheap tickets for it. What seats did you get so we can be nearby? See if \*insert other fiends\* etc. will want the ones you've bought""

I got pretty mad and after back and forth and he refused to take the tickets that I'd bought, despite him then buying tickets to the SAME VIEWING about a row in front.

For reference, regular tickets were £11, cheap tickets were £7.

I ended up finding 2 people to take their tickets (who had already seen the film and I'm half convinced were just being nice to help me out), but I was never upset about the money. I was upset with B knowingly screwing me over to save a few pennies. It's such a tiny argument, but its the precedent of the situation.

AITA for feeling like this is a massive dick move?

EPILOGUE

I don't hold grudges ever and try and talk things out with people as much as possible, but its been a month now. I've spoken to him and his justification was 'You know I've got my weird ways of doing things' and I apologised for buying tickets without asking first, but things still haven't settled in my head and we both think we're in the right.

To start this off, I’m a huge Pokémon fan and I’m super excited for the new Detective Pikachu movie. I finally got an opening in my schedule to see it and a few days ago asked a girl at my work if she wanted to watch the film. 

To preface this, this girl seems to be super into me. She gives me a lot of interest signs such as always touching my arm, laughing at everything I say, copying my traits, inviting me back to her place alone and always finding a chance to get close to me. 

Initially she said she wasn’t interested so I simply said “if you change your mind let me know” and left it at that. This morning I got a text saying “hey ___, what time was the movie?” So I set a time and place to meet before the movie, I got there and she was 10 minutes late which was slightly annoying but anyway, we managed to make it to the ticket booth with minutes to spare for our session.

Everything was good for that moment, we were talking and laughing. But as we got closer to the cashier, she started to say that she really wanted to see Aladdin. I said that we can watch it another time but for tonight I’m wanting to watch D.P like we planned. 

When we got to the man, she said she didn’t want to watch DP anymore so I just ordered a ticket for myself and then told her to go home. I ended up watching the movie and it was great! She sent a text telling me to enjoy and I thanked her after the movie was finished. AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My husband (26) and I (26) have been together for 6 years and married for 1. This has been an ongoing issue through our entire relationship. I truly don't mind if he masturbates because I understand that we all have needs, but I am a very light sleeper and between the light of his phone and the shaking from the motion it wakes me up. He'll stop for a minute, I go back to sleep, and then we repeat this cycle another 5-10 times until he finishes. 


I find this really disrespectful to me. I have told him many times that this irritates me and I make him aware of my irritation every time he wakes me up. Last night, however, he acted like I was being completely unreasonable about it. After the 5th time of waking up and trying to get him to stop I moved out to the couch. Like I said, I don't care if he does it, I don't care where he does it and when he does it as long as it's not in bed when I'm trying to sleep.

So this whole thing started about two months ago

one of my online friends, who I would talk to constantly, suddenly stopped responding to my messages for no apparent reason.
It kinda happened periodically, like she started talking to me less and less until suddenly she stopped texting and never responded again... 
Our last couple of texts were just us joking around and nothing too alarming.. but for some reason that I cannot fathom, she suddenly stopped. And here is the thing, all I want to know is why?.... what did I do for her to just suddenly ghost me like that?
I feel like I’m annoying her constantly by continuing to try and find answers, but I also feel like an explanation IS needed from her.
at first, she would read my texts of me asking her for an answer but not responding to me, then she muted me so I couldn’t see her stories (this all happened on Instagram) but she would still see my mentioned stories, and yesterday she blocked me... I tried everything that I could that isn’t public, but of course, she never responded.

This whole thing is affecting me mentally, I know I did something wrong but don’t know what I did... I just don’t want to affect her or annoy her in any way, I told her multiple times that if she didn’t want to talk to me it’s ok... all I wanted was an explanation on WHY she didn’t want to talk and I’ll leave her alone afterward.

Should I stop or WIBTA if I continued to try and find an answer from her?

bvjb68	2019-06-01 10:13:25	throwingaway2800	AITA for threatening to stop supporting my wife financially?	"I will start by saying I pay for about 70-80% of me and my wife’s cost of living expenses (necessities). She makes about 1/3 what I do so I like for her to be able to save and have extra money for things she wants, vice dump it all into cost of living.

My wife has a friend called Yasmin. Yasmin is part of some group (it has a spanish name so I don’t know what it is) that says they empower women. My wife told me about this group one day, apparently you submit $1000 (somewhere or to someone??) and become a level 1 group member, gaining levels by recruiting more members. Once you reach level 5 or so of the community, you have about 30 people under you, and you graduate from the community and receive $30,000. All the while the group is supposed to support each other and help you attain your goals by giving you that cash infusion at the end. The whole process is supposed to take 2 months.

As soon as she told me about this, the words MLM, scam, and other things came to mind. In my opinion, this is some type of MLM disguised in a veil of “empowerment of women.” Yasmin is 4 months in and still trying to recruit people because she has not seen her money yet. Somehow Yasmin has convinced my wife to join this cause. I tried explaining to her that some MLMs *do* actually work, but those stories are few and far between and only to the insider people who started the whole thing in the first place, never the grunts that join later. I told her that if she does this she will 1) never see her money again 2) become an embarrassment to herself as she begins to essentially ask all her friends and family for money to join the program so that she can get hers 3) waste a lot of time when this never works out. I think she has good intentions, at least as far as wanting to make more money and contribute, but she has somehow gotten tricked into thinking this get rich quick maneuver will work.

When she told me she wanted to join I fought her on it and told her that I will stop helping her pay for things on this main basis: I am currently doing so because I like to help her with her basic needs/necessities so she can spend her money on things she wants.  Because this $1000->$30,000 is not a 100% guarantee, she is essentially gambling her money that she will turn a profit. In this perspective, she has money beyond her basic wants and she even has enough to gamble with, therefore there is no reason for me to still be supporting her needs/necessities. 

I will admit that I feel like I am using money to strong arm her into making a decision for her. I would normally never do this to her but I just feel so strongly that she is about to get screwed over and I don’t want to see that happen to her, so I am almost threatening her to save her from herself. I did end the conversation with, I cannot make the decision for you, I can just tell you my thoughts on the matter and inform you of the actions I am going to take if you still decide to do through with this."

bvjauy	2019-06-01 10:12:12	adam_philip	AITA for asking my ex not to text her new guy when we're together?	"My ex broke up with me about 2 months ago, and we've both been moving on since. I know she has because mutual friends have told me. And I'm happy for her! I've also been on a couple of dates with a couple of people, just testing the waters after a long term relationship.

Anyway, before we broke up we bought tickets for a festival to see some of our favourite bands all in one place. Before we even went I asked her to try and not message her new guy around me, and I'll do the same. It just didn't seem fair on the other person having to see that. 

We get on the train and immediately she starts going on her phone, So I try not to pay too much attention to it. Then when going onto the underground I can clearly see she's messaging someone else, which we agreed we wouldn't do. The day goes on, and every 10 minutes when I look over to her or try and make conversation, she's messaging this guy. It starts to upset me because I thought she would've had more respect for me than that. 

On the train home I decide to tell her how much this upset me. I told her that I haven't been texting someone because I didn't want her to be upset, and I hoped she would have done the same. Her response was ""I don't owe you anything anymore. I have no obligations to you and you can't tell me what to do"". 

This really pissed me off and I spent the rest of the train journey in pretty much silence until she said ""I'm getting off at the next stop"". I asked why, and it's because she was off to see her new guy. She had been messaging him all day, and then went back to his place infront of me.

But when I got home I started thinking about what she said, and thought that I could be the ass hole in this situation for asking her not to text someone else in front of me. AITA for asking her to not message someone in front of me, even though we're no longer together?

TL;DR I went to a festival with my ex and she spent the day texting a new person. Then when I told her it upset me, she told me that she didn't have any obligation towards me. She then left me on a train to go round his. AITA?

EDIT: Thank you to everyone that set my mind right and made me stop obsessing over this. There's a lot of aspects in myself that I need to try and get over (like having a need to control certain things and being insecure). Its not always great hearing YTA, but I think I needed it."	Asshole	0	0

I was in line for around 15 minutes with no one behind me, a guy in a wheelchair pulls up and only had three things so I let him go in front of me.

Her husband without asking tries to get in front of me so I said ""I've been waiting here for 20 minutes please don't try to cut in front of me"". Then he says ""My wifes pregnant and can't stand on her feet for too long can I go in front of you?"". At this point I'm a bit frustrated since he first tried to get in front of me without asking and only did this after I let another guy in a wheel chair get in front. Normally I wouldn't care but this couple had a huge shopping cart filled with items, the line was already moving slower than molasses and I just couldn't take it. So I told him that she didn't have a problem running around the store (I saw her walking around fine earlier not exactly running but swift walking around the store and she was at most 4 or 5 months pregnant).

Before I could even respond the person in front of the guy I let in lets this couple go in front of them. I was frustrated so I said ""If you could walk around the store fine then you could wait like the rest of us"".

I'm a 21 yr old female, and throughout life all I got was zero emotional support, mostly criticism and invasion of my space from my mom. That left me with significant social anxiety among other emotional baggage that a lot of us carry from (may I say) incompetent mothers. I'm not saying I want her to be perfect, because no parent can be, but I what I am saying that she does not act and did not act like she cared about my wellbeing ever. Now that I'm going through a phase of my life where I'm healing my childhood traumas, I have a wonderful boyfriend and many friends and I choose to keep her distant and not speak to her while we live in the same house. My plan is to move out sooner than later, and I do not plan on speaking to her until I sort out all the things she has done and approach her even though I have a strong feeling that she won't listen and that she is going to make herself a victim. I just need some honest opinions here. I know that shit can happen, life can happen, I may never get to speak to her about that but I'm willing to make that choice because at this point I realize that out of a ton of moments we had together in life, 2% of them were happy.

We all have important exams coming up next week and so I was going to cancel yesterday but then I was chatting to one of my friends and I could see how excited they were about it and quickly changed my mind.

This morning one of the other friends messaged saying they might not be going as they have family coming down that they don’t get to see often and that they wanted to revise as well. 

I realised that if I told them about how excited the other friend was then they might reconsider. But this felt wrong and like a dick move.

So instead I tried offering other solutions like them coming later so they could see their family and maybe we all revise together the next day so they can be prepared. But they seemed pretty adamant that they can’t come. 

I also didn’t want them to cancel as when they aren’t with the group things can sometimes get a bit awkward as they seem to sorta bind the group together and I didn’t want things to be awkward.

So I then told them about how excited our other friend was and they seemed more open to reconsidering but now I feel like shit because I’m pretty sure that’s some form of emotional manipulation? And it just felt like making them choose between family and friends so now I’ve put them in a shit situation where as if I just didn’t tell them then they wouldn’t have to make a decision.

bvj64u	2019-06-01 09:51:18	digbicks845	AITA for allegedly feeling up friend’s GF	"Okay so this friend of mine met a girl who recently moved to our town. She’s pretty chill and all. one day, the three of us were hanging out and she says she wants to get more involved in the community and she mentioned she works out so my friend told her she should come to the gym with me since I work out pretty regularly as well. 

When I go to the gym, I usually don’t talk to anyone, I just go in, do my stuff, and leave. But I didn’t mind going with her to show her the place and getting her comfortable with the area and stuff so we went together the next day. 

She told me “I’ll just do what you’re doing” and I don’t really need to say all the exercises, just know we were doing squats and deadlifts that day. She mentioned she used to work out but it was pretty evident she didn’t as her squat form was really bad. Or maybe she was just really rusty idk. For all you non-squatters out there, it’s really important to make sure your back is straight otherwise you’re just gonna get injured especially with when you add weights. 

On that note, her back wasn’t straight as she was kinda hunching over so I told her “hey keep your back straight” and she says she will but she just moves around a bit and nothing really changes. The weight wasn’t heavy for her, she just had really bad form. I tell her it’s not straight and I basically put my hand on her back and straighten it out. The same thing happens on deadlifts. Her form is really bad as she’s hunching over and again I straighten out her back with my hands. 

At the end, she thanks me and we dip and I really don’t think much of it. Workout was pretty standard. But, later that night, my friend confronts me and asks me why I’m “feeling up his girl”. I’m confused at first but then he mentions I tried to “grope her during lifting” which I find absolutely ridiculous. If her form is just blatantly wrong, I should try to fix it to make sure she knows proper form down the line. I would do the same if it was a guy. I don’t give a fuck if it’s a girl, guy, grandma, frog whatever. 

His side of the story is that I put her in compromising situations and took advantage of her which I find absolutely dumb. I have no interest in his girlfriend. She told him which means she must also think the same which I have clear up. Or maybe she’s just manipulating him? I really don’t know. But I leave the judgement to y’all. So AITA?"

bvj5uj	2019-06-01 09:49:57	Wiz_the_fizfull	AITA for not wanting to talk to my best friend of 10+ years because of a girl	"So i have stopped talking to my Best Friend (Gavin) of 10+ years, as of three weeks ago because of the choice he has made about this girl (Charity).

So a bit of background, i meet Charity online in September of last year through a game. We started playing game and chatting, she was very obviously flirting with me in the beginning but i didn't want anything, as i was just ghosted by my first girlfriend. About a month past and she started talking to Gavin randomly out of no where, i'm talking the first message Gavin got from Charity was at 3am in the morning on a work night saying "" nice to meet you, hope you have a great sleep and hope you have a great day tomorrow."" after that they started talking to each other.

After about 2 to 3 weeks Gavin decides he is going to ask out Charity. She said yes but on the one condition that he cant tell any of his friends or any of her friends. Unable to contain his excitement he did tell me in secret. I thought it was really weird and a big red flag but Gavin was extremely happy as it was his first girlfriend. I did say i thought it was really weird and to be careful but i kept my mouth shut otherwise because he was extremely happy. The first two weeks of their relationship he was the happiest id ever seen him. Then things started to spiral downhill. Gavin started to get really angry over the smallest, stupidest things which wouldn't of bothered him before in the slightest.

A week goes by and I messaged Gavin asking ""are you alright, whats going on."" He called me that night and started talking to me about what had been happening, basically Charity had stopped messaging him back, every time they set up a time to meet (they live about 2 hours apart by train) she would always have some excuse to not meet, she had started to avoid talking to him in Discord in favour for another guy she just meet which was making him extremely jealous, to the point he started to think all his friends where talking to her behind his back.

After about 1 hour of Gavin and i talking about how the relationship is not healthy for him and how he wanted to confront her to give her a choice on if they are together or not. I told him i believed Charity is the type of girl who bounces from guy to guy for attention, as she flirted with me pretty much the moment we started talking. He asked me to sent him the messages because we tell each other everything. After reading the messages he wanted to find out if our other two friends got anything similar.

bvj5ak	2019-06-01 09:47:26	cueknfirj772	AITA for completely cutting off my friends for getting pissed they made fun of my long distance relationship?	I live in Cali he lives in New York. I met him on vacation. We talk 24/7 and he plans on coming to Cali soon to visit me. My friends were straight up making fun of me. Saying ‘hahah your gonna have to pay to go to New York to visit him’ which isn’t the case at all. They said he’s gonna cheat on me. They just kept straight laughing to my face. Now here’s the thing. I get long distance doesn’t work all the time. But it is a real thing you can be in. But if your my friend, and you seeing me happy doesn’t make you happy, then your not my true friend at all. It almost felt like bullying. It went on for awhile too and they kept bringing it up and knocking it for NO REASON.

bvj3b6	2019-06-01 09:38:50	kilobravo333	AITA for not going to my sisters graduation? Causing her to delete me from her life.	"My sister and I have had a rocky relationship from the get go. We're both in our mid/late 20s now and get along half the time. She's very.... outspoken.. meaning very blunt, rude, disrespectful to family and strangers. I could list a million scenarios but just trust me that I'm not speaking from my own feelings. Anyone I introduce her to quickly finds out she's a bitch basically.  She means well (sometimes) and is very sensitive, yet will blow up on anyone any chance she gets. 

To the current issue. I found out 3 weeks ago she's randomly graduating. She's been switching around majors and what not, starting and stopping school from the random times shell tell me about her life. My dad tells me this and asks if I work. I told him I do and have to take any overtime I can get because I'm struggling financially. But I'll see if I can work some OT earlier that week so I can still make the graduation. He informs me that grandma needs a ride since I live close by and I can bring her if I come. I tell him to plan out everything as if I'm not going in case i need to take the OT and if I can make it I'll pick her up to make things less complicated. 

Communication is apparently not my family's strong suit cause no one told grandma I was going when I told him a week ahead of time I decided I'd just go and forget about the OT. I couldn't get a hold of her for 3 days playing phone tag. Was informed she was now driving herself but wanted to follow me to feel more comfortable. 

The week passes, graduation is tomorrow, I'm at work until almost midnight and an overtime opens up for the morning (I was unable to get any OT this week so I REALLY needed it). I talk it over with some coworkers and decide I should just take the OT and not go to the graduation since grandma could follow my sister in the morning and didnt know if this was her final graduation. 

I tell her just now that I can't make it and the whole story. She blows up on me (expected) but then continues to blow up and list any time I've ever ""wronged her"" in our lifetime and dont give a shit about her. When communication is a two way street!!! I try to defend myself but get fed up by her attacking me that I start attacking back and telling her how she's a very mean person who can't take anyone else's life into consideration but her own. Yeah it's her graduation but I didnt know it was her last one.

Idk sorry, I rushed this, I'm fed up talking about it but feel guilty and want other perspectives... she's officially blocked me and said she wants nothing to do with me anymore after I told her I'd cancel the OT and go! Ugh!

TLDR: Sister is a bully. I cancelled going to her graduation last minute due to needing overtime at work for my financial struggles. She blocked me and is writing me off from her life... AITA???"	Not the A-hole	0	0

My boyfriend had met my best friend before but never really had an opportunity I get to know her. They basically hit it off. I broke up with my boyfriend and they went on a date but it didn’t go well. 

Yesterday the guy my best friend was interested in texted me and asked if I would be interested in going on a date. I asked my best friend if she would care but she keeps avoiding any conversation about my boyfriend and the guy (she says she feels bad about ‘stealing my boyfriend’ and doesn’t want to talk about him or the guy she was I interested in)

this has torn our family apart and I'm thinking that most of my family will never speak to me again after this. 

so about a year ago  my brother confessed that he found children attractive, instead of attacking him I decided to help him find a mental illness place in my area and get him help. he had no photos or had ever watched any videos (that I know of) but I did search his computer and phone and found nothing. 

I managed to keep it a secret and he went to a treatment center (he is currently still there) somehow my auntie found out and told my entire family. I then got over 20/30 messgae and calls telling me how horrible I was and one family member told me that she wished to never see me again. I was also banned from seeing any of my neices and nephews. 

they where mad that I did not tell them as they would of wanted to know, I tried explaining that I wanted this to not blow up like it is and that he is getting help and was going to tell you after his stay or if he is staying there for a while we would of arranged a meeting.

bviynr	2019-06-01 09:18:14		AITA for refusing a car from my parents	"I made a post a while back (but deleted it) where I was overwhelmingly called TA/a spoiled rotten bitch. Basically my brother gave me a car as a graduation gift, my parents convinced me to put it in their name, I spent $2k fixing it up, then my mom gifted it to her drug dealer and gave me a car that was a couple years newer but in much worse condition. I wanted to either keep the new car and sell the old one to pay for the repairs, or just keep my old one and not get the new one. My mom called me an ungrateful bitch and a disgrace to my grandfathers memory. I ended up with the new car, which my parents again did not transfer the title to me.

Currently I’m backpacking Europe, which is a big ordeal for me. I don’t have cell service and rely on iMessages when I get wifi. After 5 days without internet I connected and got a bunch of messages from my mom. First she said she crashed her car and was borrowing mine. Unfortunately I didn’t have the opportunity to tell her I’d cancelled my car insurance because this is a several months long trip. So she was driving it without insurance, then surprise surprise, crashed my car as well. And then was obviously upset at having called the insurance company to find it was not insured. I got all of these messages at once. 

So I called home and my dad (not my mom) wants to help buy me a new car since my mom is the one who crashed mine. I said I don’t want the money, just because of the whole fiasco with the last car. I want to buy my next car on my own so that 1. My mom will have nothing to hang over my head (even though she doesn’t make any money, my dad buys all the cars). And 2. It will be in my name. My dad seemed hurt that I refused, but he knows how my mom is so he didn’t really argue. My mom on the other hand is blowing up my phone calling me a bunch if fun names with a half assed apology mixed in and some more name calling. I’m also thinking of moving out of my parents house and into my boyfriends parents house when I get back home (we are both in college, my parents house is about 45 minutes closer to our schools than his parents house)."		1	0

I just finished spending the day with my gf. (Whom I will call Z for a random reason) Long story short, we really don't like each other's friends, social groups, or acquaintances. We also don't agree with music taste, and political views, but we don't really care about that all that much. We talked about it and I decided that maybe one of us, or both of us are a little bit of an ahole about hating each others friends for no real reason. Idk, I mean, we're only young teens and it might not matter all that much other than to have fun while we can, but then again, maybe for each other's sake, we should accept and hang out with each other's friends.

bviv3b	2019-06-01 09:01:34	anon84201anon	WIBTA for cutting ties with my best friend?	"Ella (21F) has been my (20F) best friend for 10 years. We were very close & were college roommates for 2 years.

In Feb my bf and I were both leaving town for different reasons for 4 months. We have a decent car that neither of us were planning on using for that time. However, we also owe lots of money on the car. Ella works a minimum wage job and was supporting Steve & herself for a while. They didn’t have a car & we weren’t going to use it so we let them (Ella) use it for the 4 months. 

It was $90 less for insurance to add Ella, but not Steve. We told Steve that he could pick up & drop her off at work, & that’s it. We also told them they didn’t need to pay us ANYTHING.

2 months in, we found out Steve had driven the car to his new job what we thought was just a handful (3-5) of times. & had also been using his phone to record Snapchat videos while driving. This was clear disrespect & broke the only rule that we put on them, we asked them to give the car back. 

Steve and my bf discussed it, & Steve made it sound like it was an emergent situation that only happened a few times. He also did not apologize for using the car without permission, but whatever. Steve & Ella absolutely didn’t tell us that he was driving the car for more than the handful of times we brought up to them, & we dropped it.

This was a month ago. But I found out about Steve taking advantages of other close friends & I was suspicious. Our car has a WiFi hotspot/gps tracker in it. I downloaded the logs for the 2 months they used it... Yikes 

Steve was driving the car for almost the whole 2 months they had it. From 2 weeks after we gave them the keys to the day we found out about the previous incident

Ella was the one I told several times that Steve couldn’t drive the car (we told them both but I stressed it to her multiple times). When I asked why she couldn’t just ask, she said he was only driving it to work on days she couldn’t take him (25 times in 2 months, ok sure). Didn’t answer me when I asked why she couldn’t ask us for permission. Asked me to drop the subject

I just found out that one of the people I thought I knew so well was lying to my face and using me & my boyfriend for 2 months. & was not only lying, but trying to rugsweep and ignore my feelings. 

She responded several hours later with: “I thought the understanding was that Steve could drive the car when he needed to”. With another sentence asking me to move on from the issue. 

Yet another lie. My bf & I both found texts on our phone from the day we left the car with them that said “Steve can drive you to work and that’s it, he cannot drive anywhere else”. 

She lied to me twice, used me, manipulated me, tried to take minimal responsibility for her & Steve’s actions, & tried to get me to “drop it”. Twice. 

I feel like I don’t even know her. I know she still wants me to be friends & we have some mutual friends involved but I am fully ready to cut ties and never speak to her again bc of this toxic behavior WIBTA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bviuuk	2019-06-01 09:00:40		AITA for calling out my boyfriend for saving random pictures of woman on Instagram?	"Me(25f) and my boyfriend (m28) have been together for awhile. We have kids together and live together.

My issue is he saves pictures of random good looking women. Obviously they are typical Instagram worthy woman with perfect bodies. Most of the pictures aren't even explicit... They are clothed and just posing. A lot of them you can see a lot of ass though.

He also followed an account that is pretty much a bunch of girls from our  city (which is a big city BTW). It's private but it says right on the bio 19+ and it's clearly just a bunch of hot girls shaking their ass and showing off etc.

I confronted him and told him I thought it was innapropriate. I said he wouldn't be okay with me following those accounts on my personal Instagram for all to see. I told him saving the pictures of all those girls is almost obsessive and crossing a line to me.

I know i sound insecure but I'm not anti porn. I can recognize he obviously looks at good looking woman and likes it. My issue is... Why are you saving pictures and following accounts dedicated to random hot girls?? I find it tasteless and gross. I wonder what the hell he does with those saved images.

In my world you see a good looking person, admire their hotness and move on with your life. If your horny you watch porn, and close the tab afterward. So all this grazing through random models and saving their stuff comes off as a little bit much to me and I called him out on it.

But I have some problems and can be difficult sometimes, I’m not good at expressing my feeling properly as I tend to keep them in, that’s what I’ve been doing my whole life. My family never really knows when I’m sad or what I’m feeling.
So when I get mad or sad, I tend to shut down and it gets difficult to get anything out, I have to force words out to boyfriend when he asks what’s wrong. I’ve gotten better at expressing my feelings and can tell him what’s wrong and we can sort it out, but sometimes that just doesn’t happen and I stay quiet and ignore him.
He says I overreact to things that are no big deal and that I shouldn’t be acting that (crying, staying quiet) but I really can’t help how I react and feel about things and it makes me feel really bad that I can’t control my emotions

bvirf6	2019-06-01 08:43:28	roconfused	WIBTA to uninvite aunt from wedding	"Going to try to keep this brief because of character limit.

I'm the black sheep of my family. No one invites me to family events, talks to me ect. It's been like this since I was a kid so it's almost natural to us now, I'm basically forgotten. When I made engagement announcement an aunt (call her A) specifically requested to be invited to wedding. I'm inviting all my aunts/uncles as I'm trying to put effort into building relationships. I've already sent save the dates.

Recently another aunt died and I went to her wake.  A was there so I went to talk to her. For the entire conversation she threw a pity party about her kids being terrible/not liking her. Then told me how her family basically disowned her for marrying my uncle. I told her I'm lucky our families support our marriage. She told me it might be a front and how he may not be who I think he is as her husband hid things for a long time. I exited the convo as soon as I could.

My sister spoke with her afterwards and A asked if I was pregnant because she thought we were rushing the wedding (its in November we've been engaged since Mar last year), and ""I guess my fat is spread out evenly "". 

Now I want to uninvite her. I don't want someone so negative at my wedding and certainly not someone who's going to shit talk others. I have several obese friends and I'm actually thin (though not the stick I used to be), if they heard her commenting on my weight it might really upset them.

I mentioned twice that I don’t want to eat out right now because I am tired, pregnant, and have a migraine and prefer to just go home to sleep. So no one listened and we went anyways.My BIL sat on the toilet for over 20-30 minutes and we were the only ones at Denny’s. So the server had to wait on us to order.The server explained that his wings were still getting made because of a mistake. Everyone else got their food. So then he gets his finally gets his wings. We finish eating at 3:00am. My migraine is just off the wall at this point, my eyes are flickering and I fear nauseas. So we get our separate checks and go pay at the counter. My BIL says Btw! Your $2 tip is on the table in a sarcastic’ish happy tone. This right here is what pissed me off. I didn’t say anything but honestly I was fumed. I felt like he was the asshole for not having proper tip etiquette. His tab was $20 but still blurting that our was unnecessary and makes me look like an asshole for being in the same group as him. Just made things awkward. I finally get dropped off at my moms to sleep and when I arrived I sat down on the floor and started vommiting and seeing stars. I was really really sick.

"I’m only 20 and have decided to be child free to prevent my mental illness from being carried to my child amongst other things, like the only way I’m able to live my life is because my parents pay for everything I do, minus school and a drug charge which took out all of my savings when I turned 18 to get a good lawyer. Unlike my siblings when they were my age, I loved to work but because of how life panned out I have been diagnosed with complex ptsd, severe depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. I also went through anorexia and probably still qualify to be one. I’m just not the most stable person, but I’m not dangerous to anyone but myself. I have a loving fiancé that supports what I want to do. But I don’t know how I’m going to make it in life without aid moneywise. My siblings both make 6 figure salaries and graduated from a prestigious university. I was on track to go too, but the anorexia took me out of the game for a couple months. When I went to college I was with a kid who was in foster care and saw how much it could damage a person, all he wanted was someone to love him, and he would sometimes have panic attacks and yell awful things at me but always took it back. I just never got over how his life coulda been better if just one adult loved him and showed him a good life. 

I just want to know if I’m an asshole for depending on my future husband and money from being a foster parent to get by in life..? I’m working on getting my bachelors, I just don’t know what In... what to do.. I don’t know when my parents help is going to fall through the cracks . They say never but I don’t believe them entirely. They’ve kicked me out a few times and I lived with 8 people in an apartment. But my parents have always paid for my food... probably because they fear I won’t eat if they don’t which is probably true.

I went to a 4 yr university in korea for 2 yrs and then decided that i wanted to learn how to fly(i always have since hs but gave up b/c of the cost). I taught english in korea for 2 yrs as part time and saved up $10k, and then came back to the US. My plan at first was to stay a semester and just get one license(there’s 5 in total). After flying for about a month, i decided that i really wanted to pursue a career in flying and chose to stay here longer than planned. While staying here, i didnt wanna fall behind on education so i decided to start fresh again from community college, and hopefully transfer to a UC. I told my dad, who’s currently in korea, and he’s been nagging me that im wasting my time and falling behind everyone else since i wasted money and two years of my precious twenties time in korea. (Btw he didnt pay for my college and isnt going to pay for my cc or flight school)

He wasn’t at the point of being outraged until i told him a few days ago that i wanted to stay here longer and attend community college. When i told him he got really angry and started yelling at me , that i’m wasting time and the correct order would be for me to graduate college in korea, find a job there, earn money and then start flight training, which i do understand why he thinks that way. The two years worth of education i got is going to waste and he wants me to get a job asap. 

Although, i dont think it was a waste of time at all, since i was able to meet a lot of good people and got to learn A LOT of things (nonacademic stuff) as well, become a better person, and overall had an amazing and unforgettable experience. 

However, i believe there is a timing to everything and this was the right time for me to start pursuing my dream. I hate it when my dad keeps reminding me that im wasting my life and time and money and i want to say that he’s wrong, but im starting to feel very behind of everyone else my age and feel very useless and worthless every time i talk with him on the phone. Am i really the pain in the ass of the family and wasting my time, or should i ignore what he says and do what my heart tells me to do?"	No A-holes here	0	0
bvip49	2019-06-01 08:32:10		WIBTA If I stopped my girlfriend seeing her friend	"So, my girlfriend is away on holiday and she’s going this select part of a country with her family. 

Just so happens this is where her old school friend lives, who happens to have been a thing with her ages ago. They never got with each other, but he did call her up on New Years and ask if they could meet up and talk about something. Weird timing and she didn’t go as she forgot. The guy apparently still had feelings and he was her first ever love. 

Anyways, she wants to meet him when she’s away on holiday and I don’t know how I feel about it. She recently cut me off from one of my female friends, who similarly I never went out with, had feelings for but they never materialised. She’s said that’s a different situation and this guy doesn’t have feelings for her. I can’t help but see a double standard when it comes to this guy, but he is her friend and apparently my friend was mean to her or something similar.

bvinf4	2019-06-01 08:24:37	licoricewhip100	AITA for reacting how I did to my daughter's conflict with her friend?	"Recently, my 13 year old daughter came home upset about getting into an argument with another girl over a soccer game in PE. My daughter isn’t the most athletic, but her friend plays soccer year-round. 

In this specific game, my daughter got into an argument with her friend; my daughter kicked the ball into the goal but her friend, who was the goalie and inattentive in the moment, claimed that there was NO WAY my daughter could have kicked it in. I’m guessing that’s because my daughter probably failed to do so during numerous other attempts, but my daughter thought that this girl was putting her down when she had just started to improve at soccer. 

Then, that one argument got a lot nastier and they started fighting over random things not even related to soccer. However, after a while, my daughter expressed wanting to still be friends and make things up with that girl. I told her to send an apology email, call that friend, or talk to the girl in person about it. 

Unfortunately, that didn’t work, and the girl told my daughter that she never thought my daughter would change and that they would never be friends again. My daughter started crying, but I found it very hard to comfort or feel sympathy for her. I am a very solutions-focused, practical person. At 13, I would have said, “to hell with that girl, I’m 13 and in 4.5 years I won’t ever see her again. Good riddance.” 

I told her that, and I also said, “All girls fight, and at 13 I thought you would have known that by now.” I mean, as an adult, you’re just so swamped with things that stress you out way more than some teenage drama that they’ll both forget about by the time they’re 35. 

My daughter carried on crying and came into my husband and I’s bedroom to cry and vent some more at about 10 PM. I made her leave by 12 am because it was late and I start work at 8 AM. I am honestly pretty angry about the whole situation because my daughter even missed her zero period biology class over crap like this.

I wanted to teach my daughter a different approach: that not everyone deserves your heavy emotions, like that girl, conflict resolution skills, life skills: that all women are catty (I have coworker spats with girls I work with and I never feel down because I just know all women are like that), and just how to let things go. I don’t want my daughter to pity herself when stuff like this happens. 

Instead of going to class, my kid instead spent her morning waking up her grandma (my mom) and crying and venting to her. Later, my mom called me and said that I needed to have more patience and empathy for my daughter, and that I should have given her a hug or two, even though my mom KNOWS I’m not a touchy person and don’t even hug my husband, whom I arguably love a smidgen more than my daughter. My sister even called me as well and said that I was “too cold” towards my daughter. 

Then, when she did go back to school, my kid even told her ""FAVORITE"" TEACHER about this. Why would you tell a stranger about your personal problems when you have FAMILY, like your MOM, to help you? My daughter even came home and told me that she sometimes wanted said teacher to be her mom sometimes! I don't know where that came from and why! I've been here for 13 years and her teacher has known her for like, less than a year.

I’m so confused now. AITA?"	Asshole	0	0
bvinev	2019-06-01 08:24:35	someone_pleasehelpme	AITA for not sharing the profits of my father’s company with my siblings?	"Some backstory first. We used to be lower middle class until my father started this company and it became successful. We all helped him put desks together and put the office together when he first started and had 0 employees, we were in our teens then. We all interned there for several years during high school and college and that experience landed us all good jobs with good companies. He always told us that he wants to leave a legacy behind and that if he died, and we didn’t want anything to do with his company, to never sell our shares because we would all still make a small amount of the profit if a consultant ends up taking over when he retires.

After high school I decided to go to college and follow in his footsteps. I ended up really enjoying this line of work. I worked for other companies when I graduated because when I was interning I never took work seriously and I was worried I wouldn’t give it 100%. Now that he’s retired, I’m CEO and he’s still the president. One of my siblings says I should share a small amount of the net revenue with each of them since the company is the family’s and not just mine. However this is my only source of income, and they already make 6 figures themselves. If they ever needed help I would help them in anyway I could monetarily or not. However sharing my income, even if it’s just a small percentage, seems unreasonable. Am I the asshole?

TLDR; My father started a company and became successful. I became CEO but a sibling says all his children should get a percentage of the net revenue because the company is the family’s and not just mine. 

Sorry if the grammar is not good, I’m on a 4 hour bumpy car ride and grammar has never been my strong suit.

Edit: I mentioned shares when my father was talking to us when we were young, he never actually went public with the company and I don’t intend to either. So they are currently not making anything from it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bviki8	2019-06-01 08:11:13	Whatthepluckreddit	AITA I want to ghost boyfriend and his house herpes.	"My boyfriend of nearly two years has recently gotten infected with bedbugs. About a couple of months ago I saw one for the first time ever in the bathroom of his home and advised to get his landlord to take care of it quickly because it was probably coming from a neighbor( very sketchy neighbors in a semi-sketchy apartment building).  He told me they came ,inspected ,saw nothing but exterminated. 

Fast forward to about a month ago, one morning after spending the night at his place, I found a baby bedbug in the bed and saw the telltale blood spots on the sheets. I told him I wasnt returning until it was fixed. He told me he contacted an exterminator and they gave him directions on eradicating them which he followed and they were gone. I stayed away about a week to be certain. He assured me he saw none. Tonight I woke in the middle night during a visit and already paranoid, I took my phone flashlight and scanned the side of the bed and what do I find? A cluster of bedbugs just waiting to get their next meal. I woke him up to show him the evidence and left.

Now I want to ghost him because I feel they will never go away and I dont want to get infected with his house herpes in my new apartment of only three months(god forbid I havent already) and although he is very neat, he lives like a hoarder with boxes and boxes of clothes, papers etc. and will never have the money or time to clear every possible item of an infestation . Am I the asshole for wanting to leave since we will essentially never be able to visit each other until he somehow gets this resolved?

Edit: Im ready to leave because this has been a daily back and forth of him brushing off the problem and me and only me going through extraordinary measures to keep them from spreading. I bag my clothes in garbage bags when I visit, spray the bad down with isopropyl alcohol,  bag them again when I return home. Wash,dry the clothes, vaccum  and hope none followed me home. He can rarely visit because he doesnt want to follow ""the protocol"" which makes him feel like a leper. I dont have any choice but to leave since he's been lying about them being gone,because there is really no way I can see them and he cant. He even tried to insinuate maybe I was bringing them since he never notices them otherwise and now im just over it. Ghosting may not be nice but I don't prefer confrontation and he will just make more excuses. No sane person can live like this.

On the way back once I found my seat, one of the females said they were a party of four and if they could sit together?  Now I didn't have the best seat, so the moving wouldn't have been that bad but what if someone showed up for that seat, then I have to deal with it.. plus it's my seat.

I’ve seen what the foster system could do to kids growing up and I want to save kids from it, but I could use the money to help raise them. That’s one of many reasons I don’t want to have a kid. And I know I’ll end up spending my money on the kids as well,  but I think it would help greatly. I would hope to be a foster mom that will stay with them forever and just do that as my job for the rest of my life. My fiancé supports me and with his salary we could do it. We are struggling moneywise but just as much as any young couple would be. I’m just going to get a business degree so I can work part time or do nothing but raise the kids. Whatever seems to fit. I tend to have a knack with people who are mistreated and abused and have aggressive personalities because of it. So I believe I could love them despite any disabilities that come with it.		1	0

bvih06	2019-06-01 07:56:04		AITA for not doing dishes?	"The title alone would normally make me the asshole, but bear with me. Throwaway because my brother knows my reddit.

About six or seven years ago, my family replaced our old dishwasher after it had been broken for several years. I was a teenager away at a camp at the time so I didn't witness the process.

A couple years later, the new dishwasher breaks, in a fairly severe way. Around the same time, our well develops issues supplying water. My mother does not want to deal with having to clean the areas that needed work enough to get someone in to repair (afaik, money was not an issue here), so as a family we decided to just wash dishes by hand. I agreed, with my only caveat being the sink should kept clean and empty. It's not that big, so it doesn't take that many dishes to make washing other dishes a pain in the ass. I mention the well because apparently washing a few dishes at a time uses less water than the machine.

Fast forward to today, I'm now an adult living home while I go to school. The dishwasher has still not been fixed (again, money isn't an issue), and people (technically my brother and my mother, my father uses his own set) keep depositing dishes into the sink for a long period of time before washing them. I'm talking days, sometimes weeks where the sink is various levels of full.

I've gotten to the point where I will keep unwashed dishes in my room because 1. There's nowhere else to put them and 2. I do not have an empty sink (and I'm not trying to futz it, one side is always full and the other partially or completely full).

Occasionally someone (usually my mom) will get around to doing their dishes that are in the sink, and it'll be clean for about 24 hours max before more dishes end up in there.

My family has a weird schedule so we don't sit down and eat together, and pretty much everyone prepares and eats their own food, so it isn't a case of I was fed and now I'm asked to do dishes.

The other day my brother got very pissed at me because there were no cups for him to drink out of that were clean. He says he does his dishes but I'm not sure I believe him given the volume that always end up in the sink. The most I've ever contributed to the pile in the sink in the past year is a knife or fork.

I really don't care about doing dishes, but I'm standing my ground for a couple reasons.

* The dishwasher still is not fixed.
* It's not hard to keep the sink clean.

So AITA reddit? I probably should just take the high road and do them anyway, but the situation has become ridiculous and has been going on for literally five years. If I knew how, I'd just fix the damn dishwasher myself."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bvigzv	2019-06-01 07:56:01	Sandy1094	AITA: Didn't tell my roommate that the girl he was seeing was hooking up with other guys.	"One night, my friends and i decided to go out to the local bars and have a fun drunken night.  My roommate who is normally pretty shy and timid surprised us and showed up at the club to join us this night.
  The girl he has been hooking up with, (they both made it very clear that they were not dating) showed up at the bar that night.  She didn't see my roommate was there and he made no effort to let her know about his presence and was content just watching her to see what she did while he wasn't around.
   Turns out said girl has also been hooking up with another close friend of mine.  Skip ahead a few hours, my roommate decides to head out earlier than the rest of us.  But the girl he has been seeing starts making out with a couple of guys at the bar including my close friend.  My friend tells me he has been hooking up with this girl for weeks.
  2 days go by and I didn't say anything to my roommate, but when i get to work a coworker ask about my room mate(also works with me) and I tell her that the girl my roommate is seeing, is hooking up with other guys.  She proceeds to tell him.  I get confronted later that night about it by the room mate and I tell him everything.
  To be honest i had no intention of telling him.  I planned on just not getting involved and letting everything play out on its own.  5 months have passed with no issues.  My roommate has moved on and even joked about the whole thing while we live normally together.
  We just handed in our keys yesterday and we decided to go out and have one last night together between us 4 roommates... well turns out roommate has been pissed about me not telling him right away and has a breakdown at the bar, starts yelling at me and anyone else who tries to get involved/diffuse the whole scene.

My boyfriend works as a manager at a leisure centre and swimming pool. It's where we first met.


There's multiple reasons I want him to leave:


- He cheated with a work colleague while I was pregnant. The work colleague then left but has recently come back. I will admit, the idea of her being there really bothers me. I trust him but don''t trust her.

- We moved to a town further away to be able to afford the house prices, and he's driving an hour each way. This is lessening his relaxation time and time with his family.

- He has admitted that the job is becoming too much for him to handle.


He's said himself he'd like to leave and find a job closer to home, and that he wants to be away from the woman he cheated with and the atmosphere in that job. But his family is saying I'm expecting too much. In particular his mother. We've had multiple arguments, and at the moment she's refusing to come and see her granddaughter. My boyfriend has told her she's being unfair, but she's still.refusing.


In terms of work, I am currently on maternity leave from my job as a Junior Accountant. I am taking exams to take my final exams for thr highest exams, and want to become an independent accountant.


There are plenty of leisure centres and green spaces closer to home here, and I honestly think it would benefit him.

bvify6	2019-06-01 07:51:12	callmehanz	AITA for blaming my GF and saying she is the reason we're not getting our rental deposit back and needs to apologize?	"My gf and I rented an apartment together. When we moved in the realtor convinced us to sign a 1 year contract, even though we wanted short term, as the price was cheaper and came with a few benefits (cheaper price, parking, etc..), he told me that there would be no problem if we wanted to leave we could just notify him and he assured me he would find someone to sublet. NOTE: I'm a young naive idiot who doesn't have much experience of the do's and don'ts of the real estate/renting business and I know trusting this guy was a mistake, i'm an idiot. So willy nilly we jumped in and signed the contract. After 2 months of staying there my gf and I were having some issues and frequently fighting and arguing so we decided that I should move out so we could each have some space. Gf said she was going to stay at the apartment and get a roommate as the place was too expensive for either of us to stay alone. I went out and swiftly found a new place to stay, gave a deposit and told my GF I would move out in 2 weeks. 1 day before my move day my girlfriend told me she didn't want to stay in the apartment anymore and that she was going to move. Alright, this sucked for me because I wouldn't have gone and found a new place if I knew she wanted to leave, but after all the heat we had just gone through I wanted to avoid more fighting so I just went and told the landlord the next day just before I moved out, that we were both moving out and we had to sublet the place. My landlord was being understanding and then our ""realtor"" showed up (same conversation), we told him what was happening and he said everything was fine because he had some girls who we're already living in the building who were looking to upgrade to a bigger room. I had just given verbal notice and our realtor went to go tell those girls they could move into our place next month. As I was saying our realtor was taking advantage of me and the naive young landlord. When we moved in we paid a deposit equal to 1 months rent, the landlord used that deposit to pay the realtor his 1 year commission for finding us. A few days later I found out the landlord was paying the realtor again for putting the new tenants into our room, she didn't have the money to give us our deposit back because she already gave the money to the realtor (2 times for that matter) and he wasn't going to give it back (Yes, she was running her business poorly and being bullied and controlled by the realtor). She ended up realizing this realtor was screwing her over and told him to f off. Anyways, my GF says that none of this is her fault and that she did nothing wrong, I think she was a big cause of us all losing our money by going back on saying she was going to stay in the apartment and then changing her mind at the last minute but she only blames the realtor. I think she should take some responsibility and apologize to me and the landlord, Obviously everyone screwed up, but I think she is at greater fault.

I come from a similar career background but have transformed my career by changing sectors/slightly retraining.

She asked for advice on how to make such a drastic career change, and wanted to know how to tweak her CV to suit applying for different roles. I was happy to provide advice and even sent her my CV as a guide. She asked if I could take a look at her CV once she'd edited it and I agreed to do so.

Since she seemed keen I offered to contact my Director to see if we had any project work available. I asked Jane if they'd like me to pass along their CV for consideration by my Director. Jane enthusiastically agreed. 

I reached out to my Director and they were very keen for the CV as Jane's location matched with some project work we'd recently taken on board. I contacted Jane and let her know my Director was eager to see her CV. 

Jane was excited and said she'd get it to me after the weekend. This was over a month ago, still no CV. I sent her some gentle reminders and asked if things were going OK, but she fobbed me off and never followed through. My Director was bummed and I was embarrassed that I'd wasted my Director's time and recommended someone who turned out to be unreliable.

Now, there hasn't been one specific incident with these specific friends (just as a side note, they are a male and female couple.

They have lied to me when I have asked if my partner was with them and they have said he was not even though he has been (and it been outed that this was true, not just an assumption of mine), I loaned them my car a few months ago because they had been evicted and needed a car that had a tow bar on it to move their stuff out of said house, only for them to return said car today, with no fuel, damaged and way beyond when we asked them to return it. 

They asked my partner to use his name to start a phone plan thing stating that they would pay for it but just needed it to be in his name, only for them to not pay it and leaving my partner in debt and no way for him to cancel the plan as the plan came with the phone and the friend still has it. after finding out that they were pregnant, my partner convinced me (while I was in the hospital) to give them most of the baby items I had been collecting since I was 16 years old, all brand new still in packaging, only for them to leave the stuff all over the floor, in the boot of their car and letting it all get dirty.

A few beers in I see my friend not looking well and I take him to my house to sleep, and I quickly jogged back to the bar. I stayed there for another couple of hours, until I realized I had enough and so did everyone else. So, when I got home I might have done something assholish.

So I have stayed at this place for longer than any of the other people, and I feel that I have priority in parking spots. So the nice parking spots were all occupied and I had to park under the Avid invested tree. So it leaks/cries a sticky sap. Long story short, I need to wash my car regularly and replace the wipers as they malfunction due to this sap. Seeing that I have to draw the short straw again, I flipped out.

I went to the room everyone was sitting and told them that I'm done dealing with this, and parking them in. Also told them that I will not move my car unless I had to leave and I'm not parking underneath the tree as I had to park there for the past 2 years. Now I also went on a rampage and drilled holes in the tree last night to fill with diesel to kill the tree (the dead tree won't mess up anyone's car)

AITA now having the newest girl park under the tree whilst I'm enjoying my grande parking? I really do feel bad, but on the other hand I am relieved that I claimed my parking rights.

EDITED: I didn't drive my car back, I got the barman to take it home. Like I said the place is down the road so he was happy to walk back."	Asshole	0	0

I would like to have no kids, like if you’re not 18+, don’t come.  It seems strict but it would be my day and I don’t want little kids running around getting things dirty and taking down decorations.  Also I feel as if there will be more food wasted with kids appetites changing every five seconds.

Another thing is that I don’t want anyone proposing at my wedding, planned or unplanned.  I’m sorry but that day is reserved for my husband and myself.  Not you.  Do not steal our spotlight.  I think I would be pretty ticked if someone did that to me at my wedding.

These things need to be discussed once I’m engaged with my partner but I wanted to see if I am an asshole or not and if anyone else feels the same way I do?"	No A-holes here	0	0
bvie5j	2019-06-01 07:42:57	Dr_Twitch_Rx	AITA if I tell someone to do their job?	"Srry 4 using bad English, tryin 2 stay undr 3K limit)

I work at a distant Texas Roadhouse as busser/host trainer (granted position aftr my performance durin first few months). Very first job. I have ben here over a year and ben through Hell which at it's worst was bein the only busser in the building for a month. I'm very good at what I do (been TIPPED to buss tables at my speed by customers) and I take pride in my work. I get paid roughly $2.13/hr + tipshare, same as any other busser. Now 2 the story.

We have a busser who I will call Mascot 2 protect him. He rarely shows up 2 his shifts. He takes about 5 unofficial breaks a shift (3-5 hours a shift) that last about 10-15 mins each, all occuring whenever it starts 2 get busy. When he isn't on break and actually on the floor he's on his phone and walks around without his bussing tub. Whenever he sees a table he either stares at it, points another busser 2 the table, or RUNS AWAY FROM THE TABLE.

2day was a myriad of all of these things cranked up to 11. Management and I had given him many warnings over the course of his four-month stay. Every day he was a problem. 2day I had enough.

I interrupted his conversation and said ""Hey if you could get ur thumb out of ur ass 4 a bit and actually help us do the job u were hired to do, that would b great."" (A bit over the top, but 4 months of ignorance tends 2 wear on sum1).

""Tipshare"" is shared equally amongst all the bussers regardless of how well they work. (i.e. 2 bussers work the same days and same amount of hours. 1 busser does all the work but gets paid the same as another busser who stands around all day). He had no response so I walked away.

Mascot threatened 2 ""beat my ass"" after I had left. Mascot is 17, a minor. I am 18, a legal adult in the eyes of the law. I'm not an angry person who wills 2 hurt others. I actually try 2 help others, b very polite, am quite shy, and tries to b as friendly as possible. (I was somewhat of a social outcast so any friends I make I cherish).

This was not his first time threatening 2 ""beat someone's ass"". I took this 2 management and we separately talked with management about it. Of course, being the type of person he is, denied EVERYTHING no matter the amount of evidence brought forth. But what made me think about if my actions were truly right was this statement:

""When they tell me to go clean some tables or go do my job I feel like they are ganging up on me. They are bullying me.""

In my honest opinion I feel that he's pulling the Victim Card. He says he's grown all the time. Not doing ur job (ever) is NOT a very grown thing 2 do. We all have responsibilities as adults 2 take care of, nobody is truly exempt.

So, am I the asshole? Maybe more info needed? I'm willing to elaborate pretty much all of this. I could go on but this is already absurdly long as it is. I don't like hurting people, but I also don't like taking responsibility for others' actions."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Girl- girl
Me- I, Me, Myself
Girls Boyfriend- Loner
Friend- Unbiased
 
TWO YEARS AGO-
I met Loner through Unbiased. Unbiased, Loner, and Girl were apart of a group of friends who played video game. I too play video game but not as much as other game. 

Loner and Girl had been dating for a while up to the point where I joined the friend group and right away Loner and I hit it off as good friends. I saw myself in Loner because we are similar personalities and both being “loners” I had few friends and wasn’t passing up the chance for a new one. 

About Six months in- 
our friendship grows, so does a tension (unbeknownst to Me) between Loner and Girl. Girl doesn’t like how often Loner and I speak and Loner tells Girl we don’t speak often. I was unaware of Loner telling Girl this, as Loner and I speak often and play other video game to unlock achievements. Unbiased calls and tells me to back off the friendship with Loner as he can tell it makes Girl uncomfortable. I do stop hanging out with Loner and big group of video game friends, and only join Loner every now and then because of a falling out with group. 

Loner tells me things are rocky with Girl and thinks he and I should stop talking to fix things with Girl. I’m upset because of a lost friend but accept his decision. 

Girl messaged me and tells me I’m an awful person and that she hates me amongst other things and I know she spread rumors about me wanting Loner all to myself and that I was trying to steal him from her. She blocks me. 

APPROX. 3 MONTHS AGO
I’m upset because Unbiased told me he spoke to Girl and she says she has no problem with me. I check and she still has me blocked. I label her as a liar and call her names to Unbiased. 

TODAY-

I text Unbiased and say Girl still has me blocked and mocked how Girl “moved on” but still has me blocked. Unbiased asked Girl in front of friends and I, if she still has me blocked and why? 
Girl responds (accordingly to Unbiased, as I can’t hear her because i’m blocked) that she doesn’t know why i’m blocked, it was so long ago and she’ll unblock me because she doesn’t care anymore. Girl unblocks me and “all is well”. I respond by calling her names and Unbiased leaves because I “jumped the gun” with my response and reacted inappropriately.  

Unbiased says Girl and I are both at fault. But wants me to fix it, to Unbiased, Girl did her part by unblocking me."		1	0
bvidnp	2019-06-01 07:40:40		AITA for requesting that my girlfriend pays for someone else who lost money because of her/us	"My gf and I rented an apartment together. When we moved in the realtor convinced us to sign a 1 year contract, even though we wanted short term, as the price was cheaper and came with a few benefits (cheaper price, parking, etc..), he told me that there would be no problem if we wanted to leave we could just notify him and he assured me he would find someone to sublet. NOTE: I'm a young naive idiot who doesn't have much experience of the do's and don'ts of the real estate/renting business and I know trusting this guy was a mistake, i'm an idiot. So willy nilly we jumped in and signed the contract. After 2 months of staying there my gf and I were having some issues and frequently fighting and arguing so we decided that I should move out so we could each have some space. Gf said she was going to stay at the apartment and get a roommate as the place was too expensive for either of us to stay alone. I went out and swiftly found a new place to stay, gave a deposit and told my GF I would move out in 2 weeks. 1 day before my move day my girlfriend told me she didn't want to stay in the apartment anymore and that she was going to move. Alright, this sucked for me because I wouldn't have gone and found a new place if I knew she wanted to leave, but after all the heat we had just gone through I wanted to avoid more fighting so I just went and told the landlord the next day just before I moved out, that we were both moving out and we had to sublet the place. My landlord was being understanding and then our ""realtor"" showed up (same conversation), we told him what was happening and he said everything was fine because he had some girls who we're already living in the building who were looking to upgrade to a bigger room. I had just given verbal notice and our realtor went to go tell those girls they could move into our place next month. As I was saying our realtor was taking advantage of me and the naive young landlord. When we moved in we paid a deposit equal to 1 months rent, the landlord used that deposit to pay the realtor his 1 year commission for finding us. A few days later I found out the landlord was paying the realtor again for putting the new tenants into our room, she didn't have the money to give us our deposit back because she already gave the money to the realtor (2 times for that matter) and he wasn't going to give it back (Yes, she was running her business poorly and being bullied and controlled by the realtor). She ended up realizing this realtor was screwing her over and told him to f off. Anyways, my GF says that none of this is her fault and that she did nothing wrong, I think she was a big cause of us all losing our money by going back on saying she was going to stay in the apartment and then changing her mind at the last minute but she only blames the realtor. I think she should take some responsibility and apologize to me and the landlord, Obviously everyone screwed up, but I think she is at greater fault. AITA for thinking this?"		1	0

My cousin is in the airforce and just got back from tech school today and so they wanted to drink at my house (I (20F) still live with my parents). I said no because I fell asleep around 9 pm and was tired/not feeling well after working and going to the gym. My brother went on to tell me that I was selfish and the worst sister in the world and that it would only be 15 mins. I’m not going to lie it hurt a lot since I do a lot for people but before you call me an asshole let me explain why I didn’t want to dd for my cousins gf. My brother and cousin never invite me anywhere. Even before he left for bootcamp they would wake me up to dd for his gf and I usually say no because I’m overtired and tbh a little butthurt. I’ve been home since 5 but not once did my brother invite me to hang out with them (I used to be close to my cousin) and only do they acknowledge me when they want me to dd for them. Ever since I started dating my other brothers friend (who my cousin and gf dislike) they have been treating me different and it’s one of the main reasons I haven’t had contact with them in 5 months besides my brother. AITA for not wanting to dd for them? I can’t even sleep still thinking about all the mean things my brother called me.		1	0

bvicq3	2019-06-01 07:36:18	DeCerealKiller	AITA for not wanting to see my dad anymore?	"My parents divorced when I was little due to dad cheating. Said mistress of his and him married last year.

Anyway he always comes to visit me during the holidays, but I know he only visits cause my grandmother told him to. He buys me little gifts but that just gets me to lose more hope in him as I take it as just a materialistic relationship (as you know, it doesn't take much to woo a kid). I turned 14 last December and it was the last time (last time as in his most recent) visit. He also came because for a business trip. 

Now, after the divorce and his visits only became a holiday thing, I grew wary and uncomfortable with people. Specifically men if they choose to act fatherly towards me. Mom had this one friend live with us for 5 years (freeloader no doubt) and he used to want me to give him kisses and hugs and make him father's day cards. This usually sends the feeling of knots in my stomach and my chest would grow heavy. I just wasn't comfortable but my mom insisted that he was just being nice. Luckily he left after mom made him get a job so that was that. But he reminded me so much of my dad, and I get the same feeling whenever I see dad as well.

During his last visit, I planned to tell him that I didn't want to see him anymore. He picked me up from a mall and we hung at a small cafe. He mostly spoke of himself, if not his mistress. I only perk up at mentions of other family members but then again I don't remember much of what he would say. When I got onto his car (forgot to mention that he usually visits from his hometown, hence only the holidays and he drives himself). He bought a uke for the little gift, which was something new to me. Usually he'd get me just sweets or handdowns of books. I still feel empty from it however. 

Before I got out of the car, I questioned of his marriage (which he didn't mention the whole time, I learnt about it from listening to mom's private phonecalls she has with friends). He talks about it, proudly flaunting even. He never loved my mom. Even my mom told me that he'd been cheating even before they got married and she was just too clueless. When I reached the stop, I shakily told him to never see me again and got off. Having the nerve to say that I thought, as I walked into the mall to wait for mom made me feel overwhelmed and I cried and I don't know why.

I'm scared that he would still visit again this year. What if he did hear and he would visit just to spite me? What if he didn't and this goes on? What if he gets upset? I have the urge to tell myself that I went overboard. He's still my dad, my mom would say. And she kinda got crossed with me, saying that he might think that she got me to say that. And I feel bad. Sorta. I don't know what to feel.

bvib63	2019-06-01 07:29:31	CajalProtege	AITA for letting my mom choose to live in bad conditions because she refuses compromise?	"My mind is already made up for when/if this happens, I'm just curious to see people's responses.

My mom had a ‘work till I die’ retirement plan. This plan failed when she was injured at work. 3 years ago, my wife and I offered to help supplement her income with ~$1,000/month. 9 months ago, I found out the doctor said she’d can’t return to work. She’d known this over a year, but had done nothing and hadn’t told us. We can’t afford this indefinitely, so I tried to help her make ends meet:

- She lives in a 2-bedroom house (which is in one of the highest COLs in the country) on SSDI only. I suggested a roommate, she refused.

- She wants to work. I researched jobs for the elderly/disabled and gave her this info. She said she'd call, didn't, and lied about calling.

- Moving to a lower COL area. She grew up in KY and has talked about going back. We were willing to help her move there, since it’s cheaper and she’d be closer to a lot of close family. She refused.

- She won’t sublet a room, so I compiled a list of ~60 local low-income developments and asked she call them. She didn’t, I pushed her, she argued that calling 10 places in 14 days was acceptable.

- I found available, affordable housing ~1 hr away, close to her brother. She refuses to move more than 15 min away.

- She asked if she could live with my wife and I. I refused. So she said she’d move in with my aunt, where she’ll sleep on an air mattress on the living room floor. 

I love my mom, but I would eat a fucking bullet sharing a home with her. She’s extremely negative. She constantly complains about the same few things. She complains she doesn’t see me enough, but refuses to leave the house or cut back smoking when I do. She calls me 5+ times a week, including when I’m at work, due to being lonely, but doesn’t try to socialize or make an effort with friends. She acknowledges the difficulties I’m under, but makes no effort to minimize her role in them. At one point she said, “Your aunt’s the only one who’s helped me,” to my face.

This situation will be made worse in ~1 yr, when my wife and I buy a house. She’ll want to live with us, and we do not want her to. We’ve given her ~$40,000 over the past 3 years, while she has done nothing to help herself. I won’t enter into a living situation I hate while she lived at our expense and didn’t lift a finger to help us. She says, “I’ll wind up on the streets,” even though she'll live with my aunt, and I’ve made it clear it feels manipulative (it almost happened several times growing up). I expect, when the inevitable fight with my aunt happens, she’ll bluff she’ll wind up on the streets, and may follow through (intentionally or not) to try and guilt me into a living situation she feels entitled to.

bviay3	2019-06-01 07:28:30		AITA for not wanting my husband to come on my trip?	"My (28F) best friend (28F) from college lives down south (in the US). I typically go down to her state around her birthday for a few days and stay at her place. This typically consists of going dancing, brunch with lots of mimosa and getting our nails done. 

The first two years of this tradition, my husband (32M) came with me. She was dating someone at the time and so him and my husband would play video games while my friend and I got our nails done and caught up.  The last two years, I’ve gone by myself because my husband has expressed that he doesn’t really enjoy clubbing like we do (he hates that he has to throw money down for a reserve booth/bottle service - whereas the two of us love the once a year chance to treat ourselves), he complains that all the food sucks in this state and is generally super cranky about not getting more of my attention when I’m down there. Also last year, my friend broke up with her boyfriend so the prospect of being a third wheel was not exciting. 

Fast forward to this year. My husband says that he’s coming to visit my friend with me. I shared - “oh actually, I kinda just want it to be a girls weekend like the last couple years.” He seemed hurt. I continued to share that since she’s single now, I don’t want either of them to feel like a third wheel, also we had our set traditions like getting our nails done and going out, which he didn’t enjoy and was very obvious about it. He kinda made a face but said nothing else. I thought it was over. 

Ever since that happen he has talked about “our trip” to see my friend several times. Letting me know he got the time off from work, talking about when we should book it, sharing how excited he was for it and looking at flight prices. 

Each time he brings it up, I’m kinda taken aback and don’t know what to say without being an asshole. I felt like I was clear that I was going alone and I feel like it’s weird that he’s pushing this. Especially because we’ve talked about in the past how cranky he has been on the trip in the past. It makes me feel like this is because he doesn’t trust me. 

I would never do this to him. I would never just invite myself to a bro weekend. There’s a lot of time that I’ll purposely make sure I’m out of the house or not around so he can have a video game session with his friends all day without worrying about alienating me. He acknowledges it  and say thanks me being so supportive of his friendship. 

I feel like I shouldn’t have to push back so hard for me to get the same space and consideration. Especially when I explicitly asked for it. My best friend doesn’t mind if he comes and thinks ITA and should appreciate the fact that he wants to come.

AITA here? Should I just let him come? Does it make me an asshole that I really have no interest in him coming?"		1	0
bvi9dw	2019-06-01 07:21:42	punk_fiction	AITA for thinking this waitress was a bit rude?	"Okay, this is pretty mild but I’m interested to hear what other people think. I’ll preface by saying I’m in the UK so tipping isn’t expected in the same way it is is elsewhere. 

(I do always tip, but that’s not the point of this story.)

My husband and I went for dinner last night. Usually we pay using a card but we happened to have cash on us. We planned to leave any change the waitress brought back as the tip, and add extra from the change we had on us (would’ve added up to a decent tip). 

But when the waitress came to take the money, she asked “Will you be needing any change?” and it really threw me for a loop. Of course we said no, but she ended up doing herself out of a bigger tip because we didn’t have opportunity to add the extra we would have otherwise. 

I’ve worked in service and would never have asked outright if the person I was serving wanted change. I’d bring the change back and if they left it behind, bonus for me. 

As I said, this is really mild but I’m genuinely interested to know if this is totally acceptable and I’m an asshole for thinking anything of it. To be honest, I don’t know if ‘rude’ is the right word but it just rubbed me up the wrong way.

That would be fine if she could take some criticism back however she is the most sensitive person I have ever known in my life. To give you an idea, one time she cried because I didnt know she was coming along with us so I sat in the front seat of the car (her usual seat) and even after explaining to her that I didn’t know she was coming along, she accused me of trying to tell her to stay home and to not join us on trips anymore.

Anyways, yesterday my mom mentioned how my little brother got caught hiding cheez-it’s in his room and she defended him by saying that she hides food sometimes too because I’m disgusting and I touch my dogs. She also said that sometimes she wonders how I can live with myself knowing that Im super nasty.

Honestly, I just had enough of her always taking down on people and frankly she’s not the cleanest person in the world either so I RESPECTFULLY told her “Hey grandma, we all have nasty habits here.”

Her: “No. Excuse me but I don’t”

Me: “Yes you do. You put your bare feet on the kitchen table sometimes and you leave your used tissues on the table aswell.”

Her: “Oh, excuse me. I didn’t know that was nasty”

She then gets up from the table and goes to cry in her room and now my entire family is pissed at me for “being rude” to her however I feel completely justified. Not only does she always attack me the most, I’m just tired of hearing her talk about people 24/7 and what bothers me even more is that she can’t take an ounce of criticism back.

Anyways, my family is pissed at me and want me to apologize for being “insensitive and rude “ to her but I literally said it in the most respectful way possible. My mom is threatening to take my keys away (I’m 16) if I don’t apologize to her but honestly, I have no intentions of doing so

So before I begin a little backstory I’m 14 years old and in middle school so this might seem a little bit childish but me and this girl have been friends for almost a year and we’re really close and as she put it I’m top three of her friends. I’ve had a pretty large crush on her for quite a while. So I was happy when she recently said that she would date me so I planned ask her out a day before I was gonna do it when we were going out. She told me I shouldn’t ask her out because she cares about me so much that if we ever broke up she would want us to stay friends and she doesn’t think that would happen so I agree (even though that’s dumb cause by that logic you don’t date people you like) The day I was supposed to ask her how she came over to my house with a friend to watch movies just so happened that my brother was there ( who I hate) him and her were cuddling the whole time and it really ticked me off she made sure I saw two because she made direct eye contact with me and she grabbed his arm and wrapped around her self (yeah ik sounds childish) so I got mad and posted on my Snapchat story that people only come over to my house to flirt with my brother and insult me ( which she had made fun of my acne while watching the movie) after she left she saw my story and she had her best friend text me and say that they  can’t be friends with me anymore cause I “made up rumors” and now she’s crying.. I text both of them a whole ass essay just apologizing and telling them how I feel about the situation. I told them to call me and eventually I got them to. After a solid four minutes of them not talking and me just apologizing her best friend  finally talked she said “ how could you do that you made her cry for the third time” she also said “ you are stupid friends” and then she hung up.

AITA for telling him it hurt my feelings that he responded that way? He’s a really close friend and I feel really conflicted about starting a disagreement with him.

Her house is about 10 minutes away, 8 if I speed. So as I'm rushing down the road to her house she sees a walgreens and the conversation goes like this.

""Can we just stop there right quick?""

Today was payday, but I know she doesn't have a bank account, she's out of cash, and we haven't cashed out her check. So the first thing that comes to mind is...

""Yeah sure, do you have any cash on you?""

""No, can I use your [debit] card?""

""Sure, if you pay me back""

As soon as I said this, she looks at me in shock.

""Can't you just cover this one time?""

""Uh... No?""

At this point I'm thinking, I have a job that pays barely over minimum wage. You get the same pay I do. I know we just got payed and I know you can afford to pay me back when the check is cashed. Of course, I don't say any of this. She then says something along the lines of

""Would you make me pay if it was toilet paper?"" In a pretty pissed off tone.

""Yes. Look, your house is just around the corner, let's just go there.""

At this point she's fuming in the passenger seat, but I know if I hurry I can get her home pretty quick. Just as we're about to get to her house she says

""Should I pay you back for all the dates we've been on too?""

I get a bit pissed off at this comment. Not gonna lie, I was not happy to hear this passive aggressive bullshit just cause I wouldn't stop.

""Look baby, I don't think I was unreasonable. It's my money and I don't have much of it. But whatever, we're almost there, it's too late to turn back now.""

We sit in the car fuming a bit, but I get her home as quick as I can and she appologises to me. I know she gets really anxious and doesn't like conflict or tension, even less so on her perios, so I don't know if she appologised because she felt she was in the wrong or if she just wanted to get the fight done and over with.

So I turn this over to you reddit. Am I the asshole?

EDIT: Just to make it clear, I never stopped, I rushed to get to where we we're going. The walgreens was at an intersection, most of the conversation toom place at the stoplight.

EDIT 2: So general consensus so far. I'm the Asshole. And talking to ya'll, here's how I could have handled the situation leagues better. I could have let her use my cash to get the tampons and let her get comfortable and then asked about the cash ordeal. Whether or not I would be the asshole after that, I don't know. But I agree with most of you after thinking it out. I'm the ass. I'll be sure to learn from the experience. Also please, tell me if this new way of thinking is flawed, I'm curious."

bvi4vg	2019-06-01 07:02:10	throwawaaaay94	AITA for not wanting to tell my daughter that her biological father does not care to be a part of her life?	"My husband (who is not my daughter’s biological father, but has been more of a father-figure in her life than her biological father has) and I just got into an argument because he says I am wrong for not wanting to tell her that her biological father doesn’t care much to see or speak to her.

A bit of background, my daughter is eight years old. Her father hasn’t been very active in her life since she was born. He’s been in and out of her life, only seeing her maybe 3-4 times a year. Despite this, she loves him, constantly wants to see and speak to him, and doesn’t really see anything wrong with their relationship. She’s a child, still very oblivious to how toxic her relationship with her father is. 
When he does see her, he is great to her, but it’s the fact that he makes no effort to be an active part of her life that is upsetting. 

I basically have to take the initiative, contact him, and set up a date and time for him to see her, otherwise he would never see her. I do this for her sake, as she loves him, and seeing him makes her happy. She’s constantly asking me if she can go spend time with him.

The argument between my husband and I came about after I vented to him that I reached out to my daughter’s father and asked him if he would like to spend some time with our daughter before her and I leave town on vacation for the next few months. Her father never responded. This upset me, but it’s nothing new or surprising. I went to my husband to vent my frustrations on the situation.

This is where my husband suggested I stop trying to force her father to be an active part of her life. He also suggested that I tell my daughter that her father doesn’t care about her, doesn’t care to spend time with her, and doesn’t care to see or speak to her. His exact words were “Tell her the truth that her dad don’t give a fuck about her or seeing her.” I found this to be extremely harsh and inappropriate, and was appalled that he even suggest I say something like that to a child.

I believe it to be best to just allow her to figure it out on her own when she is older, mature, and capable of having a better understanding. I believe one day she will see her father for what he really is and that it is not my place to share such harsh and heartbreaking info with her at such a young age. 

My husband disagrees and states that when she is older, she will resent me for keeping this from her. From this point on, our discussion spiraled into a huge argument where he basically kept stating that I’m in the wrong and I’m the asshole in the situation.

To give some context, recently i've been struggling with some personal issues, sometimes i get really anxious and start crying about everything i think is wrong with me and some of my choices.

This ""attacks"" can be at any time, anywhere. i've feel that my mental health has been declining and i'm actually afraid i could go if not crazy, atleast paranoid about everything i ever do. So in one of the most recent ones, i decided to call my mother and tell her that if we could afford a psychologist, i didn't tell her the reason why and i just brushed it off telling her we'll discuss it later. NOTE: i wasn't paying attention to what i was saying

two weeks go by and she was insisting that we need to talk about what happened, i kept on avoiding her and telling her that we'll discuss it later, and that i didn't feel comfortable talking about it with other people present, etc.

End of backstory

So today was a pretty average day, and my mom stopped asking me to talk about it like three days ago so i just continued like nothing ever happened, the day continued normally until 11pm where out of nowhere she stopped what she was doing and sat down looking at me with a serious face telling me we need to talk, i tried to talk it off making jokes and trying to continue doing my own thing but this time she was insinting more than ever. i ran out of excuses and started telling her that i did not wanted to tell her nor any one on my family, as i feel this as a pretty personal thing that i want to take care of my own, and she kept asking me the usual questions, ""what's happening"", ""is something wrong at school?"", and things like that, i just kept telling her that nothing was happening and that i no longer needed the psychologist, she kept asking and asking, i kept insisting ""I do not want to tell you"" she started asking other questions and finally asked one that reached my boiling point, ""So do you want me to ignore you and everything you tell me from now on?"", i kept silence for a while and told her in the most serious and direct response i could, ""no, just le me be clear and dont take this at heart, but is my mental health, and i dont want your help or anyone else, i want to see a profesional, because frankly i dont think you or anyone on our family can help me"".

The room went silent and my mom just told me, ""ok, good night"" but she was obviously going to cry, I kept insisting it was nothing personnal, she ignored me and went to bed, since this i've been feeling like trash and i think i've done some of the worst things i could have possibly done. so just to make this clear i dont want clarifications about my life, nor questions about whats happening, i just want to know am i the asshole?"

There are ants in the kitchen, clothes, dog toys, dust, dirt, bugs throughout the living room and elsewhere in the house. I said to her ""It would be my dream to just make it [the house] clean and presentable"". 

My intent was to say that I had a passion for these two things and wanted to show her that I care by cleaning up what my SO and her family haven't been able to do since they are very busy people and do not necessarily have time to take care of a large house.

bvi384	2019-06-01 06:55:05	maccatm	AITA for being rude to my sister's boyfriend?	"My sister (25) has been dating this guy for about 3 years now. I (19) didn't initially have anything against him. I definitely don't consider us as 'close', despite my sister and I both still living at home, I don't see much of him.

&#x200B;

Recently, the boyfriend has been dropping snide comments directed at me or my parents. Last year, my sister had been complaining that she needed a new phone to all of us. One time, without the topic coming up, he told my mum that she should buy my sister a new phone. My mum was a little offended because a) she didn't think it was any of his business and b) it wasn't like my parents bought the other siblings new phones. My younger sibling and i both get handmedowns when my parents upgrade their phones (which I'm super happy with, since I work part time). My sister also works full time and earn a considerable amount so she could easily afford a new one. I'm not sure what my sister had been relaying to her boyfriend to make him think he should speak on her behalf but whatever. My mum didn't make a big thing out of it.

&#x200B;

He also has been doing the same thing to me. At an extended family gathering at our place, I was wearing a tank top and shorts. However my sister started insulting me in a joking manner (but it still kind of hurt) calling me a slut/ 'slutty' for 'showing so much skin'. It was a hot day and I didn't consider what I was wearing to be inappropriate. I asked her to stop multiple times but she didn't. The next time she did, I told her to 'shut \[her\] face'. Her boyfriend behind her turns around and says to me, 'I wouldn't talk to your sister like that MaccaTM, otherwise she won't be giving you lifts to and from the train station' (my sister doesn't actually give me lifts often, just sometimes when its on her way home to save me the walk). I didn't reply but I was really annoyed he was getting involved in this thing between my sister.

Edit: this was in front of our relatives, it was really embarrassing.

&#x200B;

A few days ago, we were going out to dinner and my sister invited her boyfriend. My mum was laughing about how I didn't have my drivers licence yet (I take public transport to uni because its easier/ cheaper). I said 'Yeah.. I need to get my hours up but I don't have time at the moment because of exams'. The boyfriend goes 'maybe if you spent less time clubbing, you could practice'. I don't go out partying often except for a phase in first year of uni during orientation and all. I don't know how he would know if I party a lot (considering I don't talk to him), I guess my sister must have told him.

&#x200B;

I proceeded to reply with 'maybe you should be less rude'.

&#x200B;

I felt kinda mean but i was also really annoyed. During the dinner, every time he asked me something, I replied with short answers and wouldn't talk to him otherwise. My mum afterwards said I was being rude and that I should be polite no matter what. But this isn't the first time its happened where he drops these kind of comments (there have been other instances, apart from those above). AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bvi30i	2019-06-01 06:54:13	Samsung8296	WIBTA If I stopped praying with my mom?	"So a little back story I am not religous at all and I am a 23 year old living with my mother. I moved back home about a year ago to help save our house and have been helping splitting house payments and utilities with her. Because of this, I am not able to buy food most of the time and at her insistence she cooks all the meals. 

  I have always felt kind of guilty for my mom cooking all the meals even when she insists, because I am a grown man and should take care of myself. My  mother knows I am not religious but every so often she will start dinner with a prayer and hold my hand and it seriously pisses me off. I have not said anything to her since she is the only one cooking I feel I should be respectful to her, but at the same time she is not respecting my religious  views (or lack of) whatsoever. 

What do you guys think? Would I be in the wrong if I demanded she stopped, and prayed to herself? I just perceive this as she is trying to subtly force her religion on me."	No A-holes here	0	0

bvi1go	2019-06-01 06:47:25		AITA friends job is potentially in danger and I was told by the boss to keep it a secret.	My boss pulled me aside today and asked if I would quit, if he fired “anybody” I immediately knew he was talking about Lauren, as she would be the only person affecting my position. I told him I would leave if he fired her. This place has a really hard time holding employees and Lauren has been the most hardworking one. She’s underpaid. Just under $8.50 an hour for 60+ hour weeks while being paid salary at a set 60 hours per week. To get a day off, she works a double so the other manager can get a break as well. She has honestly stayed mostly because she got a felony while working there (distributing drugs). So it would be much harder to find a job. I worked at the company a year ago, left when the manager above my friend started hiring her family and they were violent towards me. It’s been six months and they fired the manager and asked me to come back. They are completely bare boned when it comes to staff, but since hiring me. He has had a 3 managers now instead of two. What I’m assuming he’s doing and what he hinted at was she could work the same hours, but she would be making less as she wouldn’t be the manager on duty. Honestly at this place, any manager there that isn’t assigned to be driver, is “on call” as they are the only ones who can open the cash register. It’s just his way to con her out of more money. He acts like he barley makes a living, but he owns multiple of these franchises and I’m just a driver. She would be a driver too if it weren’t for the felony as that is what she did before. She really needs and relies on this job and I care about her and don’t know what to do. If anyone is wondering why he would tell me this, I have a few mental illnesses that are on their accommodations for me being back working and he knows that I don’t react well to surprises. I’ll be in a pride parade next weekend instead of at work so I am going to miss the aftermath of this news. He’s the kinda guy to only do it to her instead of the other managers. They often call her “stupid” which I always turn down and fight against. She’s a good manager. I know she is being taken advantage of. What do I do?		1	0
bvi0wx	2019-06-01 06:45:08	Hcavok	AITA for one-sided flirting with my ex's friend.	"First of all, mobile so apologies for formatting. Anyways getting right into it, me (18m) and my ex (18f) ended our 3 month relationship after she realized she still had feelings for her ex and wanted to go back to that relationship instead of ours. That was almost a month ago and at this point I had decided I wanted to put myself out there again and start looking for a relationship, nothing super serious just some simple flirting to see where things went. If nothing happened, great a new friend. If something did, I would only start flirting with that person. 

A couple days ago I started talking to one of my exes friend, lets call her EF. We hit it off well and I began to flirt and see what she's like in the relationship kind of way. Turns out EF isn't looking for a relationship but still wants to talk, I say thats totally fine and we start talking more frequently and I throw in some playful flirting every now and then.

Tonight my ex found out about me and EF talking, with me playfully flirting despite EF not wanting a relationship. She ended up getting super pissed at both of us and saying that she can't be friends with EF while we were talking. Me and EF are both struggle with mental health issues so this hit us both very hard. EF is convinced that she is the reason ex is acting like this and is blaming herself for all of it. 

AITA?

Edit: I knew EF and we were friends because we shared a class with my ex. We didn't talk much outside of it though, and the talking only really start talking actively till a couple days ago. I realized I should have added this in instead of giving the impression that I only knew EF as my exes friend."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

My boyfriend and I made it offical and we have moved in together. His son has started calling me mom sometimes but when he says it I just get filled with more guilt and hate it.

I had just about enough left where it made up a full meal (any less and I’d have to make something to go with it). So I go home and my mom’s aunt (who is staying with us for a few days) immediately opens up our take out bag and starts ruffling through the food inside. I thought it was just curiosity, like a “oh I wonder what kind of food they ate” kind of thing. Next thing I know she’s just eating my food. I’m kind of taken aback. I didn’t know what to do or say at that point so I keep my mouth shut and sucked it up. Later that night, I ask my mom if there’s something I can do or say to stop that from happening again in the future. The conversation went something like this:

Me: hey mom, can I ask you something?

Mom: what is it?

Me: when I got home, Aunt [name] just ate my food. Is there anything that I can say so that next time I can save it? 

Mom: well what’s wrong if she eats your food? It’s leftovers.

Me: well I was trying to save it for lunch tomorrow but now she ate half of it and now I have to cook another meal on top. Had she asked me for some, I would give it to her no problem, but she just ate it. (At this point you can hear the frustration in my voice)

Mom: she ate it because it’s left overs. She’s family. You shouldn’t complain. 

Me: I just wanted to save it for lunch. I’m not trying to bar her from eating. And like I said-

At that point my mom wouldn’t let me talk (she would just continue to talk over me) and she lectured me about how I’m being selfish and “not a good Christian”. Something she mentioned as well is that I do the same thing. I see it as different, but that’s why I’m asking you. Sometimes we will have leftovers, and I’ll eat them without asking (it rarely happens as I ask most of the time, but it does happen). However, I see it different because it’s food that’s been in the fridge for at least 4-5 days. My family has a nasty habit of not eating leftovers so after a couple days I eat it because it’s unlikely they’ll ever eat it and I don’t really want to waste it. AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

About halfway through, someone crashes, so the operators tell everyone to slow down, and  people do. Except for one. An older looking woman. They keep going and are ignoring the operators. It takes a dozen calls of “stop please” before they come to a stop. 
   No more issues until it was time to park. There’s three lanes of park space and everyone lines up in those. I pulled into the center lane and then a few seconds later I’m thrust forward. I look back and it’s the same person who wouldn’t stop their cart. 
   Afterwards, as they were leaving the ride, I saw they were with family members, so I said,

”Hey just so you know she (the driver) was being unsafe and I don’t think you should let her ride again” 
Around this time I realized the driver wasn’t fully mentally present and possibly had a disability. One of her family members responds with,
 “She has a disability, it’s not her fault” 
so I restate my argument. 
“She caused accidents and wasn’t being safe, her being disabled is a reason not to ride since she can’t follow directions or be a safe driver”. 

They responded with “it’s not her fault, have a nice day”
 and left. I don’t mean any hate towards the disabled woman, and I’m only annoyed with her family. My friend who I was with told me I was wrong for calling her out and asked what the point of me talking to them was. AITA? Thanks"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I smoke weed, I take acid, I drink once in a blue moon. I do have ambitions, I bike frequently, I am currently teaching myself guitar, I paint and journal a lot, and also like to read in my free time. I am not perfect, I think sometimes I get too in love with myself (despite me being in a near constant state of self hate) I realize I have flaws that others put up with, even if I am not fully aware of what all of these flaws are.


My friends are my age or younger. I am the oldest of the group. They all smoke weed, and they smoke more often than me. None of them have jobs. My one friend is in school because his mother enrolled him into a quasi community college where they get paid $50 every two weeks if they go to class. He doesn't work, and from what I can tell doesn't seem to want to continue with school after this program ends.


I overlook my friends being what I would refer to as bums. I realize people walk different paths. Forever they like to rail on me, because im goofy and do goofy shit at times. For example, I bought a Van, think scooby-doo van. They all said I was retarded. They think its dope though and they love smoking in it! 

Lately, two incidents have made me want to completely drop them.

First: Friend I will call M wants me to drive to drive an hour away so we can hang out with her ""friend"" (girl who has a crush on me who I feel like only hangs out with her when im there) I say give me $15, because to where we are going it cost me $30 in gas there and back (my car gets like 7mpg) She says no, so I say im not going, I don't care for this girl we are going to see much anyways. She bitches, says she will throw me $10, and go half on beer ($15 case of beer, I ask for $7) We go, have a mediocre time, I hookup with her friend because im bored. I apple pay request 17$. she sends $15 and doesn't reply to me rest of the day. whatever its two dollars, but it sat very wrong with me for some reason.


Maybe two days later, smoking with M and other friend J (haha i didnt mean to do that) who is her brother (they argue a lot)

J calls me retarded for spending $600 on a new guitar. Normally im passive, but this time i retort with something along the lines of ""you cant even afford to throw $5 on weed because youv never had a job"" M says ""that was a little rude"" and I say ""He called me retarded for spending MY personal money on something I wanted"" M doesnt say anything, J backtracks as he usually does and somehow pins what he said on M. I drop it.

Honestly I am gonna have no friends, but its so fucking annoying dealing with people who never uplift me. Constantly telling me im stupid, or retarded for this and that. Half the time it may be in jest, but man, make a joke thats actually funny instead of degrading me.

A guy in a car bumped into him walking in a busy street in city centre. Healthcare in our country is really good, ambulance got him to Hospital and insurance paid everything. 

However, he did make claim in court for emotional pain, not being able to work and additional care, like taking taxi’s because of trouble walking etc etc.

Since he is an expat and does not speak the language of my country, he relied heavily on my time and skills. I spend about 15 hours a week communicating with lawyers and doctors for months, translating to him and his Family and helping with the administration of the court case. 

At the end he got awarded more then expected, around $25.000. It was a big win, thanks to the good lawyer (and I believe to my communication with the lawyer). We all never expected this big Sum of money and I was never in it for the money. 

So now comes the AITA: I asked what would be my reward. I didn’t voice what i expected, but I expected maybe like $1.000,- for my translation work. Although I never voiced what I ecactly expected, my friend was very angry on me expecting something, he was the victim, and it was the end of our friendship.

She threw up her hands and said she didn't want to go through all that. I told her that it's ridiculous that the money is just sitting in the treasurer's office and she should file a claim. She said no. I offered to do all the leg work and all she had to do was sign the form but in return I wanted a share of the unclaimed money.

"Let me just preface this by saying that we are “online friends” and have never actually met in person. So I had a best friend for about 2 years. We started a small online business together and had a couple small arguments and decided to shut it down as it was negatively affecting our friendship. I continued to try and remain close friends with him despite this, but he retracted and stopped calling me and texted maybe once a week. We would formally call each other on a daily basis and text throughout the day. So this was very unusual behavior from him. Our close mutual friend told me that he would still call him and text him on a regular basis, so him becoming reclusive was only towards me. I spoke to him about this and explained how I would like to remain friends, and he could not give any explanation or reason for why he began to slowly cut all contact with me, and blamed it on us “drifting apart”. This continued for about 6 months and we pretty much only interacted briefly in the large group chat we were both in.

So just last week, he began messaging me again and wants to arrange a few calls. I asked why he was suddenly back in contact and he said he was trying to become closer again. I told him that he chose to throw away our friendship for seemingly no reason and that I had no real interest in being friends with him again. I woke up the next morning feeling shit and unsure of my decision. Am I the asshole?"	No A-holes here	1	0

bvhrgw	2019-06-01 06:06:27	bearjax	AITA for wanting my cat back?	"So context: I got my cat as a kitten when I was a senior in highschool. He was and is my cat, not a family cat. I am now 25. I have dealt with off and on anxiety and depression since a teenager and having my cat was a great help. I moved out of my mom's house 2 months before graduating highschool and my cat came with. Since having him I have moved multiple times, had many different roommates, and changed cities a few times. He has always come with me. I have never had a problem with financially supporting him and was happy to jump through the necessary hoops to have him at my rentals.

In 2017 my roommate at the time got an amazing promotion that required her to move out of state. After our lease ended, I was unable to afford the house on my own and didnt know anyone who was able to take over her portion of the rent. I didn't want to have a stranger move in..went that route before and it went terribly. Because of this I moved back into my moms house January 2018. 

By this time I also had a dog. My mom who is partial to dogs said I could bring him with, but not my cat because it would be too many animals. In my opinion the cat doesnt take up a ton of room and is low maintenance, but being that it's her house I don't have a lot of room to argue. My grandma said that my cat could live with her until I found a new home. My grandma lives in a neighboring city so I still see her and my cat relatively often, and every time I visit my kitty and I snuggle and we still have an attachment to eachother. 

Now the problem. I am planning to get a place with my boyfriend in the near future (yay!) and therefore am excitedly planning to finally get my baby back. My family is acting like I am a horrible person for planning to take him back though. It gets brought up so often.  They argue that my grandma has gotten attached to him and that he ""has a good life there"". That he hasn't been with me for over a year and it makes no sense for me to ""suddenly"" take him. No one will acknowledge the fact that I am also extremely attached, that he had a good life with me as well, and that he lived with me for 7 years before this all happened. I gave him to her with the expectation that he was still mine and I could have him back whenever, but now suddenly I get a huge guilt trip about how much it will hurt my grandma to take him. And it really is making me feel bad. 

She does have a dog and also my brother and his fiance live with her, so it's not like she'd be lonely without the cat.

Honestly even though I'm starting to feel bad, I plan to take the cat no matter what. He's mine and I love and miss him very much. But AITA for doing so??"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bvhosj	2019-06-01 05:55:41		AITA for wanting my phone fixed?	"Here's the background: My father has cancer, I am still on his phone plan, my parents are divorced and I live with my mother, and I do not have a drivers license.

Now for the full story. On Monday I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet. I stuck it in a bag of rice until Wednesday ,and then I learned that my phone is broken. I text him that my phone is broken, and then I go to a smash tournament. When I get back I discover that he has sent me three text messages. One of them is related to my phone, one of them is related to my mother's move, and one asking if I can see him within the next four days. I tell him I can meet on Saturday. Now today I asked him what time he was picking me up. He texts me what is going on with him on Saturday and I tell him when to pick me up. He then texts me to get my bathing suit and that we'd be meeting with his girlfriend for dinner. I then text him that I thought we were meeting together to handle my phone problem and then he texts me that he thought I wanted to get together with him because I haven't seen him since the cancer diagnosis. He then texts me that he is not going to the ATT store on a Saturday and that if I need a new phone we will have to go during business hours between Monday and Friday. The following exchange then happens:  
ME: Then I will let you know when I can go tomorrow, but I can’t spend time with you and Leslie until my phone is fixed

DAD: So let me understand this - you don’t want to spend time with me unless I fix your phone on your schedule?

ME: No, It’s that I can’t leave the house right now because my phone is broken and all I have is this crappy flip phone for emergencies.

ME: Until my phone is fixed, I am stuck here unless I have to go to work

ME: I would love to spend time with you tomorrow, but my phone needs to be fixed first

DAD: I don’t understand why you can not leave the house without a fancy phone.  Especially when you are with me and I have one.

ME: Because this phone is one that Mom bought so she wouldn’t lose her shit. She only put 15 minutes on it, and I have already used 5  
DAD: That does not answer the question

ME: I’m sorry, I think I’m unable to get my point across right now, I’ll try again in a few hours when I have my head strait.

(2 hours pass)

ME: Ok, now that I can think straight I apologize, it was never my intention to come off like a selfish asshole. I’ve just been upset for the past week since my phone isn’t working anymore and I’ve been under the impression that we were meeting up tomorrow in order to do something about my phone. I’ll gladly hang out with you and \[your girlfriend\] tomorrow.

It has been about one hour and forty minutes since I sent that last text. He has yet to respond.

bvhos6	2019-06-01 05:55:37	CarsonAnaDaily	WIBTA Coming out to my family as asexual by bringing an ace flag to carry on a float in a pride parade.	My mom invited me to be in the pride parade with her company. I’ve told my mom I’m asexual and this has been a challenge my whole life, I’ll answer comments about why I am that way, but it’s a long 20 year story. For her reasons, my mom doesn’t believe I know my sexuality,  but I do. I love both men, women, and trans people. I just don’t have or think about sex. It is honestly painful and I think bad thoughts about it during and after. And while it’s happening I just want it to end. My sister didn’t understand why I would bring the flag to the parade as I brought it up trying to tell her. She thinks I’d be an asshole. Iv honestly never been to a pride parade, despite fighting a very conservative Christian school since I was in elementary school and living in Atlanta. Iv always hated huge crowds, but I think riding or being in the parade is different and feels very important to me. The rest of my family doesn’t know about my sexuality but knows I don’t like sex as I’m rather open about it and it’s a big reason why all my relationships seem to go south. But Iv found a lucky man who loves me and told me to post this here when I asked him the question. I’m a huge lurker and often agree with you. Am I an asshole for being a little upfront with my specific support, while I fully support the whole thing, I’m just trying to get the asexual word out there in a positive way.	Not the A-hole	0	0

"My mom has a group of friends from a job she had about 20 years ago. They have a monthly girls lunch either at a restaurant or one of the girl's homes. I have been going to these lunches nearly every month since I was about 12. These ladies are just as much my friends as they are my mom’s at this point. 

We have had a luncheon planned for tomorrow since last month at one of the ladies homes, we’ll call her Amy. Amy was responsible for hosting and making a salad. Another lady, we’ll call her Janet, was supposed to make a roast with potatoes. It was mine and my mom’s responsibility to bring bread and dessert. 

Well, Janet just texted my mom that she had a really hectic week and forgot to shop for the roast. She offered to buy Popeyes (which is a fast food fried chicken place) or pay for any other food we might want. My mom then offered to make lunch instead. 

I love my mom dearly but she is a crazy pushover. She is usually the one to make lunch and we have the past three months anyway. We were going to make a very nice lemon meringue cake but now we won’t because we will make lunch instead. Janet is now responsible for buying dessert. 

Janet is not my favorite person in the world to begin with and I think this was a really shitty thing for her to do. So, WIBTA if I decided I did not want to go to this lunch? I am afraid that my anger towards Janet would show and I would embarrass my mom. I would still help my mom cook lunch just not attend the lunch."	Asshole	1	0

Just to be clear, I would've never said that to her face if she hadn't been so annoying about us being 'not proud enough' even though we repeatedly congratulated her and we meant it!

Okay so here we go. We're in the same training for a job in finance and pretty good friends. I also want to say that I really like her and she normally, is a super nice person if it's not about finances. This takes place in Europe so maybe a few things might work a little differently here. 

My family is really poor due to my dad being an asshole and my mom being naive in the past. It was sometimes heartbreaking as a kid for obvious reasons but now I just feel a mixture of sadness and frustration. But well, life sucks and I'm doing my best to become more financially secure.

We make about 1000 bucks a month. Recently my friend bought herself a really nice car and we were all really happy for her. She lives in a place a little out of town so it's kinda making life easier for her. 

However she just wouldn't stop bragging about how she did it all by herself and how strong she was to not spend it on clothes, traveling etc.. Another trainee (jokingly) made a comment about how that shouldn't be hard considering her dad has a pretty successful company.

She blew up about her dad 'only' contributing 10,000 dollars and the rest was her saving money from what she gets from her grandparents (1000 dollars on Christmas, her birthday, 500 for easter etc). and monthly a 100 dollars from her salary. 

I made a joke about her sounding like Trump and his 'small loan' and that even if saving the money instead of spending it was a good thing, it's not really self-made if she gets almost all of it as a gift.

Maybe that was me being petty because I have never ever received money from anyone as a gift (I know people don't owe me that ofc) additionally to paying 500 dollars for rent at home but other trainees and friends agreed with me.

She proceeded to tell us we just didn't understand and that we were assholes and stormed off. We still talk but it's not the same and I refuse to apologize for anything tbh. So am I the asshole?

TLDR: I'm not impressed by my 'weahlthy' friend saving up money for a car because she gets a lot of help and gifts and doesn't have to pay for anything at home."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvhlon	2019-06-01 05:43:42	CirockSalt	AITA for telling our houseguest her boyfriend can't stay the night?	"This is a perspective from my mother rather than mine, and I thought that I would get an outside perspective on this issue. I am on mobile so apologies for format.

For a little background: my Son's (S for short)  friend (who We will call HG for houseguest for the remainder of this story for storytelling purposes) came over to our city and stayed with us for about a week in January. We knew that her current situation at her house was not great, as she lived with an emotionally abusive mother and physically abusive stepfather. On the last night before she left, she confided in my son that she had feared for her safety back home. After S heard this, he told us and asked us if she could stay with us so she wouldn't end her own life, and 2 weeks later she has moved into our guest room of our house before we moved her to the basement about 3 weeks ago, and has been living rent free since day one.

* (also note, my son came home from college because of other issues he had in the school which is a different story and is planning to transfer to a university in state in the fall which he is really excited about).*

Fast forward to today. She is still living with us and now has a boyfriend (bf) she has been dating for about 2 and a half months. BF was supposed to be moving into an apartment within the next few days, and his mom has somehow not given him the address even though he signed the lease. So, this has led BF to sleep in his car and not showering over the past 2 days (though he has not had issues with food, as he is working in manual labor). 

This morning, HG made hints that she wanted to have him take a shower due to how badly he smells because of the aforementioned situation. I told her there were many places he can go to in town that had a hot shower readily available for him. Later in the day, HG then texts asking me if he can stay overnight. I say no, as we already have her and S in the house along with my parents arriving to visit in the next 2 weeks is already very stressful, even if it were for a short time. So, I am wondering what reddit thinks of this, as HG has been living with us rent free along with our son who is working in classes along with driving himself and HG to work almost every day.

bvhl75	2019-06-01 05:41:49		AITA for trolling my mom	"In context I got to a university out of state and was visiting for a short summer break before I went back to continue my research. Oh and my parents are immigrants. 

I am a 20F and I slept over at a guy friend’s house because I was too high to go home. It was chill that night; we just watched movies and music videos. I get home the next morning and my mom’s having this intervention with me about how I’m disgusting and that I was whoring myself out and because of it she and my dad stopped talking and they were going to quit their jobs and move away from each other, and I was being cut off financially (I got to a university with a ~75k tuition I’d be FUCKED). 

I dismissed it as her being overdramatic. But later that night she has an intervention with me about I am addicted to hooking up and partying and that this was all I did instead of studying, which I know for sure isn’t true because I saw like 3 library sunrises last finals season. 

She ended it with saying: “You’re not a respectable girl. No respectable man would ever want to and you appear lower class to everyone. I know that you’re just going to say I’m traditional, but the Americans also have a word for you: a slut.”

I immediately responded with: “A whom’st??” I’m in a weird whom’st phase. I’m a huge headass and if anyone calls me a slut, I’m going to snap back because I think it’s degrading for women. 

Well now my mom’s mad at me for being rude and non-apologetic. I feel bad, too, because I feel as if I further strained our relationship.

I run (a few) small businesses.

"Our daughter in grade 1 has got us complaints from her teacher and the school administration about her lunches. We tend to give her healthier stuff, stuff we eat at home anyways but try to make it more ""snack focused"" if that makes sense. A typical lunch might be a few slices from a baguette or some crackers, some cold cuts (prosciutto, salami, etc), olives, sundried tomatoes, etc. Or sometimes we'll give her things like rice pudding, sausage, once we even gave her some steak to bring to school. I'm just listing things we've got complaints over.

The school argues we're being ""abusive"" by giving her foods the other kids won't like, thus eliminating a ""sharing environment"". She hasn't been teased for her lunches and by her own admission likes what we give her. It's the teacher who thinks it's age inappropriate. I personally argue that what we normally give her is little different from a lunchable, what they suggested we give her.

bvhif5	2019-06-01 05:31:15	FrostyCeph	AITA for trying to get my brother to recognize an opponents injury?	"For some context before this issue, I play on a recreational soccer team with my brother and several other friends. This is something we have been doing for many years, and we enjoy it immensely. Because we live in a relatively small town, we typically keep the same players on our team each year (with minor changes) and our opponents’ teams do the same.

Due to my experience in the sport (just over 15 years), I have been the captain of the team for several seasons. I am a generally forgiving person, and I tend to try to get my team to play a clean game, even if our opponents don’t. 

A few years back our team played against a particularly dirty team, which I will refer to as “Orange Team,” which seemed to prioritize hurting our players over playing the sport. I recall one game where this team injured so many of our players we did not have enough to field a full 11 (from a ~17 player team). The most physically involved member of this team was one player who I will refer to as Jack.

Recently, our team played against Orange Team again. During the game, after physically harming one of our team members, Jack twisted his ankle and fell on the ground (it was clear it was more than just faking an injury). For those who don’t know, when a soccer player is injured to a point where they do not rise from the field, all the other players on the field kneel. I commanded my team to drop to one knee (despite having somewhat of a personal vendetta against Jack), and most of the complied. My brother and another team member refused, however. When I told them to kneel again, my brother responded with something along the lines of “No, it’s good he (Jack) got hurt.” 

This bothered me, and while I let it go for the moment so we could focus on the injury and continue playing the sport, I brought it up after the game again. I told my brother “You should have kneeled,” but he still adamantly refused, content he did the right thing. My coach also agreed, telling me my brother had the right not to kneel and I was in the wrong for having ordered him to do so.

I can completely empathize with my brother being so opposed to Jack, but I can’t bring myself to agree that it was right to break sportsman-like conduct in this situation. I pride my team on our clean play, and always look for the chance to be the ethically better team on the field.

Maybe I’m in the wrong, but I’m not entirely sure. What do you think?"	No A-holes here	0	0

One day she messages me with an ""emergency"". Her BF broke up with her on V-Day. I talked with her for a couple of hours and helped her feel better about it.

Things got pretty flirty with us. We've chat about sex and she's sent me pics of her body in skimpy clothing. She's younger so I never really put effort into pursuing that line. It's one of those ""nice if it happens"". Just looking for friends. We've gotten close and she's shared things about her life with me no one else knows.

Here's my issue: It seems she only ever wants to chat on IG. But anytime I try to hang out IN PERSON she ducks me. She agreed to a first invitation but it never materialized.

We were supposed to get lunch another time. The day before she went to a concert and got entirely too drunk. Her first time being that drunk. She was texting me the whole time and I made sure to keep her as safe as I could over text, reminding her to stay near her friends and eat plenty of food. She asked if she was being annoying and I said ""no, you text me as much as you need to tonight"" and she said ""I love you"". 

The next day she was too hung over. Okay no big deal but she never formally said ""I have to cancel. I'm sorry."" Never an apology. I said let's reschedule and she kinda glossed over that and changed the subject. So I definitely cooled off chatting with her since that.

Recently: her mom kicked her out. She messaged me desperately ""please respond please respond"" and began blowing up my DMs about it. I'm like ""yeah gee that sucks I'm sorry to hear that"" ~~but you've blown me off so much that I actually don't care~~.

After we chat I offered to take her to get breakfast or something to get some food, relax a bit, and help her sort her life out. She asked when I was working, she told me when she was working, we definitely had schedule match, she said ""I need to figure everything out"" and I said ""ok let me know"" and... nothing. For 2 days.

We see eachother at work, she's moved back with her mom. I said cool. She asked why I haven't been DMing her and I told her cuz she hasn't said anything to me. She said I left her hanging. She opened up her phone to prove it that the last thing I said was ""ok let me know"" and she said ""*what was I supposed to say to that?*"" and I said: ""A day and a time."" She kinda rolled her eyes at me and walked off.

I think I'm pretty done with her. She's always talking about ""yesterday I went to the beach with my friends"" or ""I had lunch with my friends"" or ""I did X with my friends"" and whenever I try to hang out she ducks. WIBTA if I ghosted her or just said ""I don't want to be your friend anymore. I only have time for people that have time for me.""? I kinda feel like she's just using me for an emotional safety blanket."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvhh7y	2019-06-01 05:26:39	Brickick	AITA for letting my brother see his kids tomorrow when his ex gf asked me not to?	"Title explains. But more backstory.

My brother and his ex (mother of his 2 kids) won’t let him see his boys because he won’t pay her more child support (so I hear). They’ve always had a volatile relationship filled with domestic issues. He has not been legitimized by the courts so she doesn’t have to let him see the boys and he also has been paying child support this whole time. He is in the process of being legitimized and while the judge didn’t order her to let him see the kids, he did encourage her to do so for the sake of the boys.

I agreed to watch the boys and not tell him a couple weeks ago. He was out of town that time I watched them so I figured he wouldn’t be around to see them anyway so I won’t tell him. 

Tomorrow I am going to watch them and he straight up asked me if I had seen them and I said yes and he is very upset that I didn’t tell him. So I agreed to let him see them tomorrow while I watch them. I know this will lead to her not letting me see the boys anymore but I figured it’s worth proving to my brother that I love him and support him and I know it’ll be good for the boys. 

AITA for letting him see them without telling her? They’re not in any danger. I will obviously have to confront her about it at the end of the day tomorrow bc I know the boys will tell her bc they haven’t seen him in a few months and are always saying how they miss him. 

I’m really dreading that confrontation bc she’s a little nutty but he is my brother after all and I know the boys will love to see him. She has used the boys as leverage ever since they were born to manipulate me and my parents to giving her what she wants. (I.e. if we can’t watch them when she asks, she will not let us see them or if we do anything she doesn’t like, we cannot see them.) 

I’m not looking forward to all this. I hate drama and there’s always drama with them.

Update: I talked to my brother and told him my concerns about him seeing the boys today and we agreed that he wouldn’t. I let him talk to them on the phone for a few minutes and I’m going to tell the mom everything later and tell her that I simply cannot watch them anymore with good conscience and not let him see them. He told me he is meeting with his lawyer on Monday and has the DNA and is legitimized so hopefully he will legally be able to see them soon and she won’t have much to say about it. I know it has really hurt him that I’ve done this, but I’m really just trying to do the best thing for everybody. Thanks for everybody’s responses."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
bvhfq3	2019-06-01 05:20:55		AITA for getting angry at my boyfriend after he cut off our date?	"My boyfriend (26) and I (25F) usually see each other almost everyday because we live like 10 mins apart and my job is like 4 mins away from his house. This week, things got kinda busy for him, so we didn't see each other for a couple of days. This of course made me miss him like crazy, so I was pretty excited to see him today.

Our usual routine is that he picks me up from work, we go to his house, and spend the rest of the evening/night alone together or with some friends. Today, he asked me if I wanted to go to a coffee shop after work or if I'd rather grab a beer later. I told him that I wanted to go to the coffee shop, and after that, we could go to his house and watch some Netflix or do something else.

We were finishing up at the coffee shop when he told me he'd drop me off early because he was going out with his friends tonight. I didn't say anything bc I thought ""Oh, okay, he wants to go out with his friends, nbd, at least we still have our dinner date"". Well, as we were getting inside the car he tells me ""I'm stuffed,"" *(he ordered a couple of biscuits at the coffee shop)*  ""so I don't think I'll be having dinner tonight, but I can still buy you a burger or something."" I tried to keep a smile and didn't say anything to him, but I couldn't help tearing up bc after not seeing each other four a couple of days, I was sad our date didn't last longer, and the only thing that remained (our dinner date) wasn't going to happen because he wasn't hungry after eating some stupid biscuits.

He noticed me crying, and when he asked me what was wrong, I told him that I thought our date was gonna be longer, and that I was sad bc I really enjoyed spending time with him. He said that since I picked the coffee shop option, he thought I wouldn't want to go out tonight with him and his friends. I asked him what had made him think that, because I didn't see how those two things related at all. He didn't even ask me if I wanted to go or not. I told him that if he wanted to go out with his friends without me, he could've just said so instead of making me feel like a chore to cross off his to-do list. 

(Part of why I got mad is that I didn't want to spend this particular Friday night at home, so if he had said anything earlier, at least I'd have made plans with some other friends.)

He got me a burger and we watched like 20 mins of Netflix when his friends called him. We got into his car, he dropped me off, and now I just feel sad, unappreciated and lonely.

He told me that he didn't see how not having dinner together and spending less time together affected the quality of it, plus, we'd still see each other tomorrow and on Sunday, and I get what he's getting at, but still, I told him many times that I missed him, and that I really wanted to spend some time with him this particular Friday night, and now I feel ridiculous for wanting that because it just feels very one-sided. He says I'm not appreciating the time he chooses to spend with me.

bvhez6	2019-06-01 05:18:12	yooneichorn	WIBTA if I ghosted my best friend?	"I'll try to keep this as short and simple as possible. I don't know how to have adult friendships anymore and I'm honestly prepared to be told I'm the asshole.

I have been ""best friends"" with this person for about 20 years (we're both about 25). We honestly fought A LOT as kids but we were always ""best friends"" and hung out as much as we could as we got older.

About four years ago I was pretty depressed and started ""partying"" a lot (I really just went downtown and bar-hopped) and made a bunch of new friends. I tried to co-mingle all these new friends with my best friend for various reasons but it was very casual. Sometimes the new friends would invite me to a party and my best friend would be angry with me for not inviting her. I can admit I probably should have, but they never really got close and I never felt like it was my place to invite someone to another person's party. My friend also started a good career at the time and I was still in college trying to figure things out. I worked very early in the morning and eventually stopped going out entirely because I couldn't function at work anymore. She took it personally and didn't think it was a good excuse since I didn't have a real job. We had a few nasty fights about all of this and kind of swept it under the rug.

Essentially over the last few years we drifted apart because of all this, but still tried to get lunch or drinks every few months. Here's the problem I'm having. Every conversation we have, I feel as if she's making a passive aggressive comment about me or my family or someone I was friends with at the time that we started drifting apart. Most of the time I write it off as me reading into things, but I just feel exhausted and sad after we hang out.

I have an appointment with my doctor next week to get everything checked out with me but I'd rather err on the side of caution. She's still acting carefree even though at night sometimes the lymph nodes in her throat swell so hard she has trouble breathing.

the idea of all this money racking up awaiting me after i graduate is terrifying. i have a part time job and i am planning of saving all this money (i get spending money from other random things so i’ll actually save it) and i want to pay it towards my fasfa. my parents really want me to pay them back and i know it’s selfish but i want it on my student loans. reading this back i sound like an asshole but my family is well off (middle class) and the tuition is manageable for my family. i am already commuting to school which is saving them money and i didn’t choose my top school because i wasn’t granted a scholarship there either.

bvhalg	2019-06-01 05:01:49		AITA for leaving without my friend?	"Last night, my friend (F21) and I (F21) went to another friend’s (M21) house just to hang out. Since I’m the one who has a car I told my friend that she could go with me and I would drive her back home at the end of the night. 
My friends started drinking and I was fine with that. I’m not a fan of alcohol and I also had to drive so I didn’t drink.
A few hours later I see my friends disappear into the bathroom with a girl that I don’t really know. When they come out they’re all touching their noses and laughing. I didn’t ask any questions but it was obvious to me that they were doing cocaine.
The night went on and the friend I brought with me started to feel very sick and she was throwing up a lot. She couldn’t even say words that made sense and I was terrified. We obviously helped her but it was so hard since she couldn’t even stand up on her own feet. 
After some time she wasn’t feeling as sick so she was just laying on the sofa. But I was honestly pissed off, I didn’t say anything but everyone could tell from my face. 
The reason why I was pissed off is because she told her mother I would bring her back home but how was I supposed to do that if she couldn’t even stand up?? I also felt very disappointed in her, that she would make such bad choices and expect me and everyone else around her to take care of her. It honestly made me feel awful because all of a sudden I was in a situation I didn’t sign up for. 
A few hours later she still wasn’t feeling well and we all knew she couldn’t arrive home like that. It was pretty late and I had to go home because my mom was blowing up my phone so my friend (whose we were in) and I decided that it was best for her to stay there and his mom would drive her home in the morning. 
I obviously felt the need to let her mom know that she was staying there and I just said “she wasn’t feeling well” since my friend was in such bad state that she couldn’t answer her phone.  Her mom replied to me saying “she was supposed to come home with you!! i’m going to sort things out to go pick her up”. I didn’t reply because I didn’t know what to do or say.
Today, when I woke up I texted her asking if she was ok and she just replied “yeah” but said nothing else all day. I honestly don’t know if she is pissed at me but I’m also kinda pissed at her.

There are two other people in this situation, who we'll call Steve and Joe. Steve is the one getting the divorce, and he's a bit self absorbed and irritating to everyone at times. Joe works more with him than I do and he's always talking about how he's fucking with something of his or fucking up his work. Joe also has a permanent shit eating grin, but can be serious when he needs to. 

Before Steve came into work I was chatting with Joe about how much of a handful he was yesterday. I then made an offhand comment about how I felt bad for his wife, as from what Steve has told us they don't get along too well. Joe then looks at me with his shit eating grin and then tells me that Steve's wife asked for a divorce. I immediately lost it because I thought he was fucking with me. He then corrects me and I immediately feel bad. I then hear later from Steve himself that his wife asked for a divorce over text. Later as I'm talking with Joe this subject comes up and we start laughing at the idea of being divorced over text and how it sounds like a bad SNL sketch.

So I have wanted to hang out with a good friend of mine for a few weeks now and we can never seem to find a good day until we found a good day next week. We originally planned a Dinner at her house with her husband to just chill and catch up.  
Problem: She wants to go out for a movie instead because her husband is an extra in a local movie and I really don't want to go to a movie and feel like bailing for 2 Reasons:  
1: I really don't like movies in general, they are ok but if I haven't hanged out with a friend for a few weeks or months what's the point of catching up if we're just going to a movie where we won't be able to catch up and just stare at a movie for 2 hrs?

2: I really don't like her Husband, obviously if I still want to be friends with her he comes with the package but honestly I feel that it will probably be something they would want to celebrate together and I would sort of feel like a third wheel.  
So anyways I feel like I should just bail and replan it to something later, what do you guys think, am I being an asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

&#x200B;

So as the title suggests, my best friend is a bit of a perfectionist. Normally I'd stay silent about this, but couldn't help but be worried about her; I've always felt it's impossible for anything to be perfect, and trying to attain that impossible ideal is incredibly unhealthy, both to herself and those around her. 

My quiet frustration about this boiled over just earlier today, when she said she felt ashamed about something she did that hurt me, but not guilty enough to apologize. She says that being ""perfect"" means never having to admit you're wrong, rather than being able to admit your faults. I really can't explain how frustrated this makes me, but what actively pisses me off is how she doesn't seem to give a shit that it hurt me, nor does she want to change it, as she doesn't see it as a problem.

"So earlier on today, my girlfriend and I were having a normal conversation when suddenly, a huge wave of depression came over me. Not something totally i usual for me but it’s really bad and I’m not in the best place.  

I informed her of what’s going on and asked her if she could talk so that I could vent a little bit and attempt to make myself feel better since she makes me happy. She accepted gladly and I called her to vent. This was at 12 AM, so pretty late but... she blew up my phone about 5 minutes prior to the call because she thought I fell asleep and still wanted to talk. 

She told me to just let it all out so i FaceTimed her and about 3 minutes into talking, I realized that she had fallen asleep. I poured my entire heart out and really made myself extremely vulnerable and raw to her and it just feels like a slap in the face to me and it made me feel even worse. It made me feel like she doesn’t care. 

The big kicker is that I normally hide all this stuff from her because I understand that my mental illness is a lot to handle at times, and she insists that I always tell her everything and begs me to. So I’ve started being more open and now i feel like that was a mistake. I understand that she could be super tired but I would’ve rather had her just tell me that rather than having this happen. 

It really hurts and as much as I care about her , I’m super angry and upset. I want to confront her about it and explain how it made me feel and how much of a slap in the face it feels like, and how much worse it made me feel, but I don’t want to get in a fight and make her feel bad if I’m being unreasonable and I just don’t know what to do with this.

I am 18M and go to the same uni as them. She’s just so sweet and he is an asshole. He has a history of treating previous girlfriends badly (very controlling). Honestly don’t know why she’s with him, but I guess she’s attracted to the bad boy type.

Last week,the three of us drove 8 hours to me and my cousin’s hometown. She originally planned to stay with my cousin and his friend for 3 weeks. They are in the same apartment building as my dad and I. 

Yesterday afternoon, I went down to see if she wanted to go the mall with me. I knocked and she answered, looking like she was really upset. My cousin was away with his friend on a fishing trip. She told me that she and my cousin got into an argument, apparently his roommate hit on [EDIT: like as in flirting with ]her while my cousin was away. She told my cousin, who didn’t believe her and accused her of cheating. She was crying and said she misses home.

I asked if I could help. She says she wants to go home but needs a ride to the train station so she can take the train back home. I offered to drive her to the train station, which is 4 hours away. She was very grateful, and asked me not to tell my cousin because she was scared of his reaction. I promised.

after she packed her things, we headed out. I drove her to the station before my cousin came home and noticed she was gone. I returned around midnight. When he asked me what happened, I told him the truth. He got extremely angry and we almost got into a fight. He told me to butt out of his relationships and to mind my own business.

His last job was terrible, hot, and didn't pay well. He didn't tell me he even applied for new jobs today, and that he already got and accepted one. 

We're in a LDR.

Obviously, i asked what he would be doing, pay difference, hours, etc after congratulating him. He says that it's 6 days a week, but 10 less hours (he hasn't answered if there's a lunch break, so it could be more than this), but 3$ more. I did the math, and with the new job, he'd be losing at least $1500 a year. He hardly ever has any bills, but after he kept pointing out how much more money he'd make, i finally pointed out that he was losing $60+ a paycheck. He got snippy and asked why I couldn't just be happy. I, again, told him I was happy for him but he needed to be aware of the financial change. 

I shut up and let him gush about it, following along. Eventually, he said I'd have more time with him and I should be so happy, and after the third or fourth time, i told him that i wouldn't get any more time with him, we'd be sleeping the extra hours he got, plus, now he works weekends. I was planning on visiting for the whole summer as a surprise, but am only visiting a month now because he lives in a different country, and I don't want to hang out with his mom 6/7 days a week. He doesn't know this, but this is part of why I was gloomy. 

He made a comment about how he needs to grow up, and I told him it was fine because he wouldn't stay long anyway, incase he doesn't like it, as he has told me since the beginning of our relationship, 4 years ago, that he was planning on schooling. He refused to answer whether he was still going, and told me to just go to bed.

AITA for not acting super enthusiastic instantly and actually checking the truths about the job?

extra info is that we're in our 20s, and i'm in my junior year of college at this point. i'm tired of him job hopping through low paying, physical labor jobs, and we've had many talks about this. i also encouraged him A LOT about the job, how good it was for his body and motivation, etc etc, but these were the points where I seemed assholish. 

tl;dr not jumping up and down for my bfs job like he expected. 

also, i don't need relationship advice, i just want to know if ITA in this specific instance."		1	0

So I tend to be a pretty jealous guy and I like to over think things but I know that being this way has caused problems in my past relationships so when I started dating my current girlfriend I really put this frame of mind to the side. So far everything has worked out great, we’ve been together for about 7 months and I’d have no reason to think she’s being unfaithful or anything like that. Today I decided to follow her spam Instagram account which is private. I requested to follow it and told her, but before she accepted the follow request she deleted a post from the account. Now the way I know that she deleted a post was because when I told her I requested to follow I had taken a screenshot of the account and sent it to her. This screenshot had the number of posts and when she accepted me later I noticed this number had gone down by one. I know I sound like a crazy person which is why I hate being like this but for some reason this is really irking me. I don’t really want to confront her about this because like I said earlier I’m really not trying to come off as jealous or insecure because I feel like me acting like this will drive her away. Up until this point I have not been this way at all with her. Anyways to wrap things up would I be the asshole for confronting her about this single deleted post?		1	0

We packed up her room (the essentials) from her Mom's house (divorced) as she wont be going back to live there...we're going straight from my house to her College dorm.  A few days ago, my daughter asks me for a ride to my friend Tony's house because she is getting a tattoo.  I was surprised because she never mentioned this to me before. It was definitely framed to me as if this was already approved, she just wanted to go with me to get it done. We stayed up all night looking at designs, coming up with colorways/shading, and deciding on location.  The next day we went to Tony's and she got a small 2"" x 4"" tattoo above her ankle.  I've known Tony since High School, he's been a tattoo artist for 20 years.  I completely trust everything he's associated with when it comes to tattoos.  He even did MY first tattoo when WE were in High School.  The entire experience was actually a blast for me.  I haven't felt that close to my daughter in years, we really bonded over the whole thing.  To see the guy who gave me my first tatt also give her her first made me shed a tear.  

&#x200B;

Of course the next day she posts pics online, and her Mom flips her shit.  She calls me screaming about how irresponsible I am.  I honestly didn't know her Mom wouldn't be OK with it.  She has tried her hardest to cut me out of all decision-making about Daughter, so the norm is they make the decisions amongst themselves and I'm just sometimes along for the ride (and to pay).  She's also cut me out of multiple milestones in Daughter's life.  Graduations, performances, games, etc.  Until Daughter was old enough to tell me directly, I was never invited so I missed a lot of moments.  

&#x200B;

Obviously Daughter was aware of this, which is why she simply stated to me ""I'm getting a tattoo"" instead of asking me.  I definitely reprimanded her for misleading me, but otherwise, whats the big deal?  Wife has been OK with her having sex since 13, picked her own High School and College, is fine with her moving across the country in a few months to attend and live by herself.  Why are we acting like she is not capable of deciding this on her own?  Would it be better if she gets it done 5 months from now from some shitty kid doing tatts out his dorm room with used needles?  

&#x200B;

Mom is livid.  She threatened to call the police.  Threatened to pick up Daughter and bring her back to her house.  Tried to make me take her to get the tattoo removed.  None of this is happening.  A culture was created in which I don't get input on things regarding Daughter.  A culture was created in which Mom allowed Daughter to make decisions for herself.  AITA here for not double checking with Mom that a tattoo is OK?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

bvh1x9	2019-06-01 04:29:23	sadeggy420	AITA for keeping my Ex’s nudes?	"So basically my ex and I were almost completely an online relationship even tho we originally met in person. 

When we first met, we sexted and things were fun but things got weird and we didn’t talk for a while, fast forward and we’re just flirty friends, then it gets back into sexting territory, and we are sending pics back and forth literally 5-6/week.

We both have taken screenshots and video captures what have you of everything. He makes things more “official”, we plan an actual date and shit, he blows me off and blames work which...was honestly believable at the time! Then I see my friend and she tells me about this ~~~amazing~~~ person and it turns out to be— my bf!!!!

We broke up obvi and things are awkward, but am I the asshole to keep his nudes? I know he still has mine saved, and I would never ever show his to anyone else, but I just feel really uncomfortable deleting his with the knowledge that he has mine :/

Edit: to the commenters who mentioned that it’s more about betrayal of trust than it is the actual nudes: you’ve hit the nail on the head and I thank you! I don’t feel as bad now about just keeping them locked far away (literally and figuratively!),  Thank you!"	Not enough info	0	0

bvh11q	2019-06-01 04:26:10	poopshute911	AITA for kicking my sisters boyfriend out and threatening him?	"So my sister and her boyfriend came for dinner at my place last night, and it was a fine time until after dinner when he made a joke about my girlfriend. My GF is bisexual, and he kept making jokes about how hot it would be to have a threesome with a girl, and watch her fuck another girl, and shit like that.

I told him to stop multiple times and he didnt, so after he made a comment to me about her ""fat dumper"" i kicked him out. He didnt want to leave, and made a scene refusing to leave my home so i grabbed him by the shirt and shoved him out into the sidewalk and told him not to come back until hes ready to apologize.

I figured that was the end of it, until this morning when i check my phone and get a bunch of texts from him and my sister. The basic mad person texts, death threats, saying their going to get a group of people to jump me, calling me and my girlfriend homophobic slurs. I simply replied ""bring you and any of your scrawny ass friends down here, and your getting slumped"" 

My mom told me i went to far and should have just cut off contact with them. 

AITA?

also me and my GF are both 21, my sister is 26, and her boyfriends 30. If that changes anything."	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvh0ml	2019-06-01 04:24:43		AITA for being annoyed with my boyfriend’s friend’s girlfriend seemingly always want my boyfriend to be involved in her relationship?	"That title is super confusing. I’m sorry. So my boyfriend use to live with his friend who is dating this girl. Before me, they all hung out and were great friends. I mean they still are, but my boyfriend obviously spends less time with them now. She seems to always want him to third wheel and it bothers me. I don’t think it bothers me because she’s leaving me out. I don’t really like her that much and her boyfriend does suggest double dates. 

A few examples would be: My bf and his friend were going on a trip, my bf cancelled since he couldn’t get vacation time from work. Her and her bf ended up deciding to go to the same place next year and she invited my bf. My bf said he’s saving his vacation time for me and she got upset.

The friend and girlfriend decided to move in together, and she asked my bf to join in. She said she has an extra bedroom for him even though she knows that him and I are planning to move in together in a few months. 

My bf and I watch this show together and she invited him and just him to THEIR night where they watch the same show.

I drive my bf to work since he got his car written off and I’m not really doing much since it’s summer. She offered that her and her bf can just drive him to work since “he’s on the way.” 

It’s just irritating and weird to me? My boyfriend doesn’t find it that strange and that she’s just being friendly. My boyfriend hasn’t done anything wrong and rejected all of it. I told him that it’s disrespectful for me and that I want to approach her about it. Am I in the wrong?"		1	0
bvgza9	2019-06-01 04:20:00	dieandflyaway	AITA for not going to my dads wedding?	"A bit of background for starters. Im still in my teens, and i live with my mom. Im the oldest of two other siblings, a brother and sister. My parents divorced a few years back, after thirteen years of physical and mental abuse from my dad. My sister was too young at the time to really understand what was going on so she was just happy with going in between the two houses. I ak strongly pro-mom. She has done everything she can for us and my dad is barely a quarter of that to me. My brother, on the other hand, is 100% pro-dad. He considers him a god that can do no wrong. He gets to the point of yelling at us when we dare disagree with something his says about our father. 

Anyways, i got the news a couple of days ago that my dad wpuld be getting married to his s.o., and honestly i was happy he found someone he liked. But i just didnt want to see him. He had horrible anger issues and his entire house (where i used to live) is just a wreck. He rented out my room, even, and i just didnt want to go back there. When my brother heard this, he stormed out the door, slamming it on his way out. I already felt bad for not going, but come on, there wasnt even going to be a reception. Just a courthouse. 

Later i found out that my dad got pissed off at my brother for defending himself against the guy who was living in my old bedroom- the guy had thrown a shoe at him, so my brother threw it back. My dad ended up shoving a table into my brother. Not pushing him into a table, no, he pushed the table into him. I knew something like that would inevitably happen, but idk. I havent visited him in months. Am i the asshole for not going and supporting him?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvgyez	2019-06-01 04:16:55	theaeao	"AITA because i throw away this ""junk"" every time?"	"A little backstory.  ex wife and i ""get along"" i put it in quotes because if youve been divorced you clearly have some big differences that cant be fixed.  I wont go to much into the past (today)  but what you need to know is we have kids and she knows she can ask me for help with just about anything. We ""get along"" fine enough.

She has some mental issues. So do i so do we all but hers are relevant to the topic. OCD and anxiety problems, alot of lazy and huge queen of the universe complex. Anyway She has junk.if youve been around ocd people they collect things differently. My grandma jewel had ""stuff"" piled high. My exwife has ""stuff"" mixed with garbage.She also has a landlord inspection coming. Not good.  Now the living areas stay clean with my help. Actually no they dont. She can avoid cps calls with my help once again a story for another day.

 but the garage... 
I could sit here all day talking about whats all in there from stuff she bought and never used to actual garbage bags filled with rotting garbage she was too lazy to throw outside. Instead ill talk about a single box because i think this one box explains the problem i face perfectly. 

The box came from me cleaning out her car for her 2 years ago. It has all the ""this might be important"" stuff in it from the car. I told her the first day ""look at this stuff. If its important take it out. That shouldn't mess with her ocd i wasnt asking her to get rid of anything just look at box put the shit you want in one of your piles. As soon as i left she put it in the garage. 5 times since then ive cleaned this garage. Each time ive brought the box out and mentioned it, each time she put it untouched back in the garage. Then i have to clean the garage rinse and repeat. I cant make progress. Shell let me throw out actual garbage thats just her laziness but in order to clean that i have to drag the junk out, clean and mop, drag all the junk back in. Its insane.

One final bit of important information is it wouldnt be a suprise if i did throw a bunch of junk out.  I do it every time she asks me to clean. She complains every time. Not my right yada yada but she always calls me to help her in times like these.  Because no one can make that garage pass inspection when its filled with junk.

I know me throwing shit away isnt going to cure her ocd its just what has to be done. Anyway im on reddit now and figure id put it up for an internet vote while i catch my breath outside. Lots of mold dust and just junk dust cant be around it to long in one go.



I know i have every right to refuse and let her lose her place. Her problem? Or atleast not in my control. I wont be doing that though."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Yeah blah blah make your high school relationship jokes whatever... anyways my girlfriend defends this guy at any chance she gets when I tell her how I feel about him and I've told her I'm upset about their friendship because of the way he treats me.

bvgy08	2019-06-01 04:15:34	InitialEmergency	AITA for telling my brother my mom brought friends to his apartment without permission.	"Background  Information: Currently I'm housesitting for my brother and his wife in  their fairly new apartment. It's a nice place with a good view in the  downtown area of a city. My parents are from a poorer nation and are fairly traditional people with my mom being semi conservative Muslim,  who is very proud of her culture and heritage. My brother is mostly just a typical American college student with a good job. There was already a bit of tension in their relationship but it was fairly good before this incident.

I'm housesitting for my brother when my mom calls and says that she was going to visit with a friend. I didn't really think much of it at the  time since i was just watching a movie. She shows up with her friend and we ended up going to a restaurant in downtown where another one of my mom's friends joins us. My mom decides to go the apartment and have some tea with her friends. She showed them around the entire apartment. She wanted to do this because she wanted to show of his accomplishments. I then realized she should probably ask for permission for this type of thing and mentioned it pretty lightly (I did this in front of her friends). In the end the visit ends up being pretty innocent with  nothing happening, only reason I mentioned the permission thing is I  know my brother is pretty defensive about his privacy. Anyway I end up  walking to her car and she was very upset and hurt about how embarrassed her in front of her friends by mentioning the whole permission thing (I do admit, I probably should have called after she got home but i did try to find a private moment but couldn't earlier.). I was pretty mad since I thought I was being fairly reasonable. I decided to text my  brother that she visited with friends without permission. Looking back now the way I texted was way overboard and may have escalated the situation. here's the main body of the text for fairness. ""I told her you should ask permission for these type of things she said 'you hurt  me"" how fucking self centered can a person be does she not understand your right to privacy.'.

Fast forward to the morning. I thought my brother would just end up giving her a slap on the wrist . I ended up getting a call from my brother telling me mom  was banned from the apartment and only my dad was allowed. I ended up waiting a while and called my mom. She was truly devastated. she said i stabbed her in the back and refused to listen to anything I had to say, and said some pretty harsh stuff, and that i should never grow up like my brother"". So it turns out one angry message from me caused a VERY deep rift between my family.

I know I could have phrased it better to my brother but was I in the right saying that she brought her friends over?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
bvgxtj	2019-06-01 04:14:55		AITA for being uncomfortable with gf smoking?	"This takes a little background so bear with me: I live in a state where marijuana is legal and i partake fairly often. I work part-time in the industry just for some extra cash and because i’m interested, and I have no problem with the activity itself in any way.

Before we met, my GF would also partake very regularly. She toned it down and eventually cut it out by the time we met, but she’s no amateur with marijuana. My GF has some diagnosed mental illness which she takes medicine and goes to therapy for. Her psychiatrist has expressed concern in the past about mixing marijuana and her medicines compounded with her mental illness. 

A few years into our relationship she began smoking with friends (never me for trauma-related reasons, irrelevant) and i was supportive of her having a safe, good time with her friends. After a few occasions, however, i began to notice her mood and attitude would be noticeably different (and worse) for days after she smoked. She would be rude, short-tempered, kind of lazy, and sometimes experience mood swings. We talked about my concern about how smoking may be effecting her, and since then she cut down further and now still smokes occasionally but much more rarely. 

For graduate school, GF moved cross country to an illegal state. Her brother gave her a vape pen and some concentrate (that i was unaware of) and apparently she has been puffing on it pretty regularly. First of all, i was seriously concerned with her using marijuana in an illegal state where getting caught with it could ruin her professional future (getting thrown out of school, felony charges). I figured it wasn’t my place to tell her what to do, so i never brought it up. Today, however, she’s been very moody with some pretty extreme mood swings, and i expressed concern about her medicine dosages (which change pretty frequently). She said it was probably just all of the stress of school mixed with vaping EVERY DAY that was messing up her mood.

I brought up how uncomfortable i was with her possibly jeopardizing her professional future and current mental state for vaping marijuana, and she got extremely angry at me. She said I smoke weed very often and she has always been supportive of it, and her doing so on her own time was no different. In the course of the argument it became obvious she didn’t even know marijuana was criminalized in the state she is living in, which made me even more uncomfortable. I felt justified in expressing my concern, but she is adamant i’m being a TA and i need to drop this issue and never bring it up again."		1	0
bvgxag	2019-06-01 04:13:06	koalalola	AITA for not going to my friends wedding because I didn’t get a plus one?	"So my friend Kelly is getting married, and I was planning on going to her wedding with my boyfriend, Mark. I was actually looking forward to it. 
For context, if it matters, Mark and I have been dating for about a year, and Kelly knows about Mark. They’ve never met, but she knows about him, obviously. 

The invitation came in today, and to my surprise, I didn’t get a plus one. These people have money, btw, if that matters. 

So now I don’t want to go. I won’t know anybody there! I’m not salty about it, I just don’t think I’ll have a good time. I literally won’t know anybody there. 

AITA for declining the invitation just because I didn’t get a plus one?

*Update (if anybody is interested):
I call my friend to congratulate her again on the wedding and tell her how honored I was to be invited. I reminded her I’m kind of introverted, but that it was very important to me to see them get married; and I asked if it would be okay for me to attend the ceremony but didn’t attend the reception. She flipped out, called me selfish and passive aggressive. She told me it was rude to skip the reception and I should just “suck it up”.
So I’ve decided not to attend the wedding."	No A-holes here	0	0
