bygcg2	2019-06-09 03:59:01	TheGaySpade	AITA for calling my best friend out and assuming the worst of her?	"Alright. This happened forever ago but she keeps bringing it up in arguments and making me feel like im a dick in the situations.

Lets call my friend..Lily (not real name)

To give context, she's a bit more out there with sex and relationships, I'm the prude and normally the voice of caution about it in our friend group and I don't judge her for what she does with her body or person, never have unless I consider it terrible. This is something she knows well enough.

It was, again, forever ago, we were both very underaged at the time (maybe..12-13) and she started dating a guy online. At the time she didn't have a phone and was grounded from it so I let her use mine. She told me he was 17, i believed her and even talked with him some, becoming friends to an extent.
To put it vaguely, she was sending stuff to him and having more than pg calls with him and I didn't intervene until a school dance came around and he was fantasizing about driving down and taking her.
She slipped up, saying it wouldn't happen because he was 26.
At the time, i was fuming. She not only lied to me but knew it was blatantly illegal. She and I had an all out war for a few days, her justifying it with love is love and Im being a dramatic baby that just doesn't understand and that im being judegemental, I tried making her choose between me and her boyfriend, she only got further upset with me when I called him a pedofile. I eventually calmed down, saying I wouldn't support it and she couldn't use my phone, she proceeded to call me every name in the book while I did the same, being pissed.


Long story short, she broke up while him on her own terms, still holding my reaction over my head in this next incident.


We were having a sleepover a while later, at the time I was talking to a guy named..uh Mike. Mike was an online friend and slightly over 18, but I was older and I had no interest in him at all, nothing but friends. 
He called me during the sleepover and we talked, I go to use the bathroom and come back in the middle of it, it was fine until later she was chatting with him on my phone and I see the following:


'So did you like seeing it??' Without anything else (she had been deleting the comversation)


Now, 'it' could mean anything but I just knew what it was and took the phone, asking. He said 'personality' but I just knew he was lying because..obviously it wasnt Lily asking what she saw and he wasnt dumb enough to answer.
We ended up having a fight over it, she used MY phone and MY friend to once again do things she knew I wouldn't approve of and while I was in the bathroom no less. She cried about how I assumed she was nothing but a whore (bringing up previous situation) and even later admitted that's what went down. It blew over quickly afterward until we have little fights now and again where she breaks out that I think her of nothing more than a slut. Sure, I didn't have much to go one besides a weird message and 'I just knew' along with her deleting context but I was right in the end.


Am I the asshole in these situations? I used to think no 100% but its just kinda been on my mind that I over reacted or I was thinking the worst of her or I should've kept to myself and let her be decently happy in her relationship even if I thought it wrong.

bygar7	2019-06-09 03:53:06		WIBTA if i took a break from our friendship because she got high?	"Context: Im not against smoking pot. I just like to keep the fact that i smoke lowkey because im still just 16. My school friends, however, are huge stoners. I’m totally fine with that.
We decided to take a day trip to my state’s pride festival and my school friends decided to smoke at the parade. I had come to the festival with two other friends (call them E and O) who I had known for a large portion of my life. E decided to go smoke with them, leaving me and O as the only sober people of the group. E has a low weed tolerance, so i was pretty nervous. 
When they came back I noticed that they were hit harder than they usually are. I didn’t think much of it until they mentioned that they had bought edibles from a random dude in an alleyway. Yeah, shady. I couldn’t believe how stupid of a choice it was but of course they were all having a good time and I didn’t have to give them a ride home so I didn’t care.
But E was hit hard. Her eyes looked red and watery and wide. She was moving slowly and was slurring on her words. She was crying and apologizing and eventually began to puke. A lot. I have a huge phobia of throw up so naturally I behaved a bit irrationally and called my mom out of fear (my mom is a huge stoner so she gave us advice). 
It was around 1 pm when she took the edibles and began to freak out. She couldn’t move for hours, sitting on a bench and throwing up whenever she moved. She eventually got a bit messy and i thought that there was no way she was going in my car like that. I told her to call her mom and have her help her, but she refused.
I knew she had a low tolerance, so the fact that she took edibles in a city was insane. I was mad at my other friends too, but it was my last straw with her. 
She has been making more and more stupid choices the older we get and she is also getting more disrespectful. We sat there for three hours watching her and eventually tottled off to the car. My car actually reeked of puke while she was in it.
We’ve been friends for about 6 years, so I feel terrible taking a break from our friendship. But she made an idiotic choice (and it wasn’t her first) and i dont think I can deal with her shit anymore. Unfortunately, that will affect our friend group’s dynamic so im utterly torn as what to do. I’m still appalled at my school friend’s stupidity, but we discussed it and we’re okay now. 
I just need to know if id be an asshole if i took a break from E for a bit. She isnt the person i first met 6 years ago anymore.

bygago	2019-06-09 03:52:02	nightkittynm	AITA for telling my mom she should demand payment for her services?	"My mother runs a baking business through online orders or orders directly from people in the community. It’s very successful and she gets great reviews and lots of commissions for speciality cakes, cupcakes, ect. Recently, she was asked to make a large, multi-tier cake and several dozen cupcakes for a party for my sister’s friend, whose family are my mothers neighbors. The cake was elaborate and included items in the design that were requested by the neighbors, all of which my mother purchased herself. Since this was my sister’s friend, my mother planned on giving them a serious discount even though she is not very close with the family. Normally, a cake like this plus the cupcakes would cost $450, she planned to charge them $200. 

My mom dropped off the cake the day of the party, and intended to send the parents the invoice after that, but before she did they texted her with something along the lines of - “The cake is wonderful! Thank you so much for doing this for us!” Basically the tone implied that they were taking the cake as a gift and did not intend on making a payment. In the past few days my mom has heard several similar comments, and her friend who works for that family says that she interprets it the same way - they don’t intend on paying my mom anything. Now, my mom doesn’t want to send the invoice because she thinks it would be too awkward, and is accepting that she’s going to be out all of the hours of labor over multiple days, money for ingredients, and money for the special decorations they requested, plus time lost when she could’ve been working for pay. My sister and I both think these people are taking serious advantage of her. 

To give some more details, each parent in this family makes six figures. They’ve ordered cakes from my mother before so they are familiar with the pricing.  

My mom does give discounts to friends, but she makes the offer to do that - people don’t just assume! She makes cakes for free only for people she’s really close to and they would have no way of knowing this and have no reason to assume it is the default. Clearly she should’ve been more direct from the get go, but I think even at this point she should send them the invoice and get her payment. I can’t stress enough how much work and money goes into a commission like this. 

Are my sister and I TA for telling our mother that she should ask for payment for her service? She thinks it’s too late and that we’re overreacting, but we think she’s letting people take advantage of her. We only know about this because she brought it up with us and clearly is bothered by it, but thinks there’s nothing to be done."	Not the A-hole	0	0
byga1c	2019-06-09 03:50:35		AITA for going to Hawaii for six months without my significant other?	"I used to live and work on a farm on Maui. Recently when my partner and I we're having a major fight they reached out about me returning for some seasonal work and I jumped at the opportunity.
It will give me time to focus and get my website off the ground while also enjoying my time and getting to know myself again. We have lived together for 3 years and I have seriously lost touch with who I am.
I am considering marrying this person and I'm also using the trip as a means to analyze the weight of that decision and if I would want to do it. My partner is aware of all of this. Today she lost her shit on me and is now acting like we are breaking up.
 AITA?


Edit: for clarification. When I accepted the offer she was supportive of it. I had consulted her. We we're in rough times and agreed the space would be good. But the job didn't start for another 7 months. So now it starts in 2 months and this is all happening.


Also edit for everyone going through my post history and literally harassing me: 
1) we are polyamorous we have always been polyamorous.
2) my partner recently discovered that they are asexual. Which has led to me reaching out to people for anonymous sex on the internet because I'm not openly poly and would hate for my co-workers to think I'm a cheater.
3) yta
4) I do have a mustache and it's really clean and I get compliments on it daily. So deal with that? I'll how any of this is your business.

I don't see why I needed to do this. This subreddit is pretty toxic if I have to explain every detail of my post history or risk being bullied.


Also: I noticed nobody commented on my posts from pureasoiaf. Is that not equally as relevant. Op is an asshole because he also likes game of thrones seems equal to being an asshole for being in a poly relationship."	Asshole	0	0

byg9nz	2019-06-09 03:49:09		AITA for Playing My TV Loud Despite My Roommate Getting Annoyed	"I saw another post on here similar to my situation so I wanted to see what people think.

To keep this short basically my hearing is terrible and as a result I have to play music, tv, pretty much anything pretty loud to be able to hear it. It’s my own fault just because I grew up not using hearing protection while using power tools, shooting, etc. all of which I did a lot.

Here’s the situation. My roommate and I are both in the military and live in the barracks together. Kind of important cuz it’s not like a rented apartment or college dorm or anything. There’s basically no way to move out and get a new roommate. We get along really well other than the fact that he hates how loud I play shit. He’ll spend all his time in here on the phone with his girlfriend or sleeping and expects me to just not make much noise while he does it. Problem is I can’t hear for shit. People need to literally shout my name 5 or 6 times while like 10 feet behind me before I even notice they’re there. Anyway we get along pretty well other than this one issue.

He thinks I should just watch tv quietly so he can loudly talk to his girlfriend about nothing and not have to hear it but I think it’s kind of unreasonable to expect me to watch shit in silent mode (for me) in my own room because he’s constantly on the phone or sleeping. What do y’all think?"	Asshole	1	0
byg947	2019-06-09 03:47:05	adultpotatojuice	WIBTA for telling my dad no?	"Hey guys. Just a little bit of backstory, my father (40+) and I (f 22) have had a really rocky relationship. We have gone years without speaking and we are only just sorting out our differences. I decided to move in with him 4 months ago, to help repair our relationship, to get into a work field that I am interested in and several other reasons.

Now, I have grown up with both of my biological parents, and my current step mum being alcoholics. I am a recovering alcoholic and I'm trying very hard to stop drinking. I am actually doing very well. 
In order to help get to sleep and such, instead of having a drink I will smoke a joint. I know its not the greatest, but it has less negative effects on me than alcohol does. 

I buy my own tobacco, weed, and I pay my way at the house. (Side note, when I give my dad extra money, I always ask him to please not buy alcohol with it. I also don't allow myself to buy alcohol with my own money.)
My dad also likes to smoke so its not rare to share joints with him, it has always been this way. 

Now, okay, I don't mind sharing what I have with the people around me, however I am starting to get irritated that my dad is regularly asking me for weed when he has been drinking, or is already drunk. I use it as a tool to not drink, but my father and step mum seem to use it to get more messed up. I always seem feel guilty if I tell him no, he cannot have any of my weed. So I end up just giving it to him anyway. 

Reddit, would I be the asshole if I told him he can't smoke what I have, if he's had or has alcohol?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

byg8it	2019-06-09 03:45:07		AITA for stealing a goat?	"Okay. So first off, the goat hasn't actually left the property. I stole it from my father and we both live on and assist maintaining the property.

There are three goats. They technically belong to my dad's friend. They have lived here before and I watched as my father let them live on broken glass and not take basic care of them in general.

They made an appearance on the property again yesterday. My dad said, early in the day, that the owners kind of just dropped them off and will apparently be back... whenever.

So today I saw that they were all chained to the same post and knotted together. No sign of water or my dad and by the circle of barren dirt I could tell they hadn't been moved all day. So I unlatched one and dismantled the 90s era mess of wire and took it home.

We bought an aerial run and set it up in my back yard and he seems super happy. Also set up a water trough. I got another tether for the two goats I left behind.

Left my dad a note saying ""Stole a goat. How much to buy all 3? -  The Greatest Daughter""

So... AITA and would I be more of an asshole if I also p much claimed all the goats until he either fights me for them (he won't) or the owners come back?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
byg6be	2019-06-09 03:37:19	embezla	AITA My friends kicked me out of our vacation plans	"Hey there reddit. I had to shorten this a ton and leave out a lot of things because of the character limit, but here's my situation.

I've got a few friends who we'll call Lilly and Max. We're an odd bunch, but we get along well. I also have a narcissistic mom who strictly controls what I do, where I go and who I see, so making plans is always difficult for me. I always make that clear to people and try my best despite this to be a decent friend. 

Not long ago, Lilly and her family invited me to come along on her trip to visit her aunt in California this summer. I was ecstatic. The best part is, my mom literally actually entertained the idea as well. I had the green light, so I figured she'd let me know when.

A short while later, I introduced Lilly and Max to each other and they INSTANTLY fell for each other. We were all cool and had a nice friend group. They've been dating a while now and they make each other very happy. We all hung out a few times when I was allowed, until what happened last time.

I came over and spent the day with them when Max started getting really touchy feely with not only Lilly, but also me. He kept touching me, putting his arm around me, making sexual remarks, insisting we cuddle and when I would shrug him off he'd get upset with me and make me feel bad. This kept happening, and I even told him to stop on multiple occasions to no avail. I felt powerless because I'm not very confrontational. I'm very sensitive to stuff like that and it really impacted me.

I talked about it to them both separately and worked things out- and I've been invited over since then- but Max always insists on being around when I come over, and gets upset if he's not there when I see her. I still don't feel comfortable yet and I don't want something like that to happen again, so I've been somewhat distant lately.

Apparently, too distant. The next thing I know, Max texted me and told me how excited he is because him and Lilly just bought the tickets to go to California together and they're leaving in a few days. You know, the trip I was invited to before they even met. I knew that Lilly invited him along and we were all excited to go together. I was upset. Only then did Max tell me that him and Lilly have been upset with me because I haven't been spending enough time with them, so they figured I ""didn't want to go anyways."" I never had any idea that either of them felt that way, I always try hard to ensure that I still value and care about them when I'm not around. This all really hurt me. I can't stop crying over it whenever I think about it, knowing they're leaving in three days and I won't be with them.

Am I the asshole for not spending a lot of time with them? I feel terrible for not being a reliable friend but I don't think I deserved this. What do you think, reddit?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Ever since I was a young girl she was always toxic. She'd see I'm hanging out with friends at like 2nd grade age and she'd come up and on front of them (all boys because that was or apartment complex) literally check my pants pulling them open""to make sure I'm wearing underwear"".  She would get drunk and start fights for nothing, and throw her in insecurities on anyone around her. This last time she took something we just spoke about how much it had hurt me and did exactly that herself ( calling me an emotional brick wall..I have severe depression and PTSD from my child hood) and said she hated talking to me. I'm in therapy now and I have progressed so much but Everytime I'm in contact with her I regress so much and I can't take it anymore. But I do love her dearly so I'm just super upset.

"So my friend A (19F) cheated on her now ex-boyfriend N (M20). She went on a school study abroad trip for two weeks and made out with a guy, once drunk, and then again sober. After the first time when she did it drunk, N asked her to not do it again, she would be back from her school trip in a few days and they could discuss it then. She then proceeded to cheat again, sober this time. I'm completely shocked she would do this, it's not at all what I would have expected from her, she has always been so caring and it seemed like she really loved her boyfriend, but I guess not. I'm not sure if I will continue being friends with her after this because I feel like what she did was a terrible thing to do to anyone in general, and especially to a guy she's been dating for 9 months exclusively. She doesn't seem like a great person anymore, but anyways moving on.

N now calls me once a day, (we were never friends before, except a bit through A) and he just vents, for an hour or two each day. I've heard all he's had to say, he's bashed A, told everyone what she did, all of his friends and hers, and he keeps telling me the same stories over and over again each day, and I don't want to hurt his feelings but I am starting to really not want to listen. He now tells me really private details about their sex life, how ""for the past few months she didn't initiate or she would just lie there"" and it makes me feel seriously uncomfortable. He's told me so many times how he was thinking about forgiving her but the person he loved ""is dead now and replaced with a monster"" and yes I agree A was fucked up for doing this to him. But I feel like there is nothing I can do to help him. Im not a therapist I don't have any advice besides ""don't take her back or beg for her"" (she has told me she doesn't want him at all anymore). 

I will most likely not be A's friend anymore, but I was never friends with N in the first place and he keeps saying ""Im the closest friend he has"" which is a bit uncomfortable to hear and it makes me feel like I need to be there for him 24/7. I told my boyfriend N calls me a lot and he said it's a bit weird for him to do this for 3 weeks straight, and I agree completely. So, WIBTA if I asked him to stop calling or to go to someone else with his issues? Please be honest if I'm being a complete jerk and he needs help I can continue to listen to him."	Not the A-hole	0	0
byg3z5	2019-06-09 03:29:07	TioSergio	AITA for telling my friend his word means nothing to me?	"Context..
I’ve known this friend for about 5 years, we’re pretty close and all in all, we’re very good friends and get along pretty well.
But he has this thing where he doesn’t really maintain his word, unless it’s for something that’s gonna be directly beneficial to him.
Basically, every time he says he’s gonna do something, I have second thoughts (as he never does it, excluding very specific circumstances). I’m not saying he’s a bad friend or anything, but I can’t take his word seriously anymore.

From some time now, every time he says he’s gonna do something, I reply in a very sarcastic way like “yeah, sure you will.”, “good luck with that, let me know how it went.”, or “is offer help, but we both know better.” And he started to get annoyed by it and confronted me, to which I just replied that his word meant absolutely nothing to me, but he was still a good friend.

Our friend group for kind of split in this, some of them agreed and said they’ve noticed that but never said anything, and others said I exaggerated and was a prick. This happens constantly, to the point that he “brags” when he manages to keep up his word (which in my opinion, enforces my point). 
He told me I’m being shit for constantly telling him I don’t believe in his word and that it means nothing to me, and I said I don’t care. He is welcome to prove me wrong, but I won’t lie or pretend to believe in it just for his sake.

Things like, we’re planning for a gathering and I ask someone to bring pizza or whatever, he says he’ll do it. I immediately ask someone else in private, and the friend in question “forgets” about it. The pizza comes with my back up friend any way, and he gets annoyed that I didn’t trust him, even though he actually fucked up. For the record, we always share things and he pays his bit, I’m just saying that he’s not reliable with anything that involves a tiny bit of effort.

He keeps confronting me and out friend group is divided on the matter. So, reddit.. AITA keeping on telling him his word means nothing to me?"	Asshole	0	0

So I am currently in school doing a nursing program I have clinical 2 days(11hrs) a week theory 3 days(8-9hrs) and weekend off I have an hour and half commute each way to both my clinical and theory I’m off on The Weekends 

My wife is supporting our family while I do this and work me 3, 12 hour over night shifts starting Friday’s till Monday 

We have three children now one of which is an infant 

A few years earlier I worked two jobs (60 hours a week) to put my wife through her program which was 4 days a week and in town. And we only had one child at that time and she was older (5) I never once bitched or complained about my long work days and she had ample time for studying and what not

Now back to my program my wife degrades me constantly telling me I’m worthless cause I don’t help with bills (obviously I can’t work) and expects to me to do everything around the house. During her 4 days off she literally sits on the couch watching reality tv shows majority of the day. She tells me that she did it fine when she was in her program but I try to explain that we have more children now one of which is 1 and it’s much harder to maintain peace in the house (I’m expected to keep everyone quiet while she sleeps before her next shift) which I try to accommodate but kids are kids and they don’t listen which leads me to getting frustrated and yelling and then she’ll wake up and come “reprimand” me in front of our kids. I’m to the point where I can no longer take my household or life I’m growing deeply depressed and I want to quit my program and get a divorce. I’ve tried talking to my wife but she blames everything on me and all the problems are because I’m an asshole to everyone.

byg21z	2019-06-09 03:22:34	eddieoctane	AITA for not wanting to go to cousin's wedding?	"My cousin is getting married the Saturday of Labor Day weekend. I don't really want to go at all. Am I the bad guy?

Some background:

My mom's side of the family used to be super close. And she is one of 6, so it's a big family. When I was 8, my  grandpop passed, and things kind of slowly drifted apart since then.

I really don't feel much family connection with my cousin. A few years ago, I wrecked my motorcycle pretty badly. I sustained a TBI (tennis ball sized dent in the back of my helmet, so I'm legitimately amazed it wasn't worse) and needed a steel plate and 6 screws to put my shoulder back together. The only person on my mom's side of the family I heard from was my grandmom. Also, while I was in the Navy, I would try to make it back ""home,"" but unless I made the effort to buy a plane ticket, get a hotel, rent a car, and drive everywhere, nobody really made time to see me, even though I was flying from southern California back to PA. And even now, I don't hear from anyone on my mom's side of the family (despite loving within 20 minutes of 90% of them) unless they call my mom and she forwards the message.

Then there's the date of the wedding. She chose to have a wedding near the Jersey shore on Labor Day weekend. It's a two hour drive for me on a good day, probably 3 with holiday traffic. That also means $150+/night for a cheap hotel room. It also happens to be two days after my 31st birthday, and I doubt anyone will even notice with the wedding going on.

I know part of my unwillingness to go does stem from her picking a date the same weekend as my birthday. And I feel like that's a little petty of me. But considering I've maybe seen my cousin face to face a handful of times in the last 5 years, I also feel like I was invited more out of some sense of obligation than a desire to actually have me there. And with the cost of a room, wedding gift, and probably needing to buy a suit, the $$$ start adding up.

I feel like most, if not all, of the complaints I'll hear if I don't go well be less ""we really missed you"" and more along the lines of ""you HAVE to go because she's family."" 

Am I an asshole for wanting to skip this? Am I just trying to justify a little bit of pettiness on my part, or am I letting that great Catholic guilt force me to do something I'd rather not, when it doesn't even feel much like family anymore?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
byg1xx	2019-06-09 03:22:11	r0cketappliances	AITA for bailing on my best friend?	My best friends boyfriend went on tour with his band about 3 weeks ago, and she’s been having a tough time being on her own since he left. I see her pretty often as she lives pretty close but lately I’ve been trying to spend as much time with her as possible because I know how hard it is for her. I’m a very introverted person and I get burnt out very easily if I don’t have enough alone time. I’ve also had a lot of things come up over the last couple weeks that I’ve put off in order to keep her company. Tonight we were supposed to go to a costume party that required a lot of effort over the week to get everything put together. I hit a breaking point today, everything that I had been putting off had finally caught up with me and all I wanted to do when I got home before the party was sit in bed and cry. I texted her and told her that I was not feeling up to going out, that I was having a hard time today and that I would just be miserable at the party. She reacted in a way that I didn’t expect, she immediately got really nasty and started blaming me for the fact that she had a chance to go see her boyfriends last show in a town close to home before he comes back tomorrow. I felt awful for bailing and I knew that she would be upset as she was excited for the party but I didn’t expect that. So I told her about all the things that I had been putting off to be there for her the last couple weeks and she told me that I was “blaming her for me not being able to get my shit together”. She’s telling me that I’ve hurt the two people that have been there for me because she couldn’t go see her boyfriend the night before he comes back home. She said she’s over our friendship and dropped off all my things that I had at her house. I feel like an asshole, I feel like shit today and I guess I just want to know if I’m right to feel this way right now. Thanks	Not the A-hole	0	0

He has had a lot of issues with dealing with our family members, he thinks nobody supports him, nobody cares for him even though our mom and now his wife works tirelessly to keep him happy and in check.

He never seriously worked for anything in his entire life except for offering free services to people in his community. He is well appreciated for his services. He never had a job, closed down his business. He is very rude to his wife, he need his food on time, every time, never helps in house. 

He gives away money to his friends who exploit him for his weaknesses. He can’t say no to anyone except his family. He was actually ecstatic when his business closed because he never wanted to work a day in his life. He is not confident in doing anything other than religious and community service. 

He has lost money in stock market and by lending to others. I don’t trust him with my money anymore.

Last week I asked him to send me his bank statement as I came to know from my mom that he loaned money to his friend again without our knowledge, but he refused and long story short I cut him off and we are not taking since last week.

He is in India and I used to send him $500 every month.

I only have a single grandparent left, and she is 90.

I'm planning a trip to see her (she's 1000 miles away) and I'm concerned that if things suddenly turn worse in the future, it could be my very last chance to have quality time with her, since many people will be around in such a circumstance, and I won't have her to myself.

The trick is that there are also wonderful cousins, aunts and uncles in her vicinity, and it would feel weird to go 1000 miles toward them, but not the last 3 miles to actually see them.

byg0gp	2019-06-09 03:17:12	justnotcoo1	AITA for letting the cat stay?	"When I started dating my SO I had 2 cats. One old grey tabby and a second cat that one of my kids dropped off at my house that was pregnant. My SO has an old dog. I am not a dog person, he is not a cat person. I know he loves his old mutt to death and I would never disparage the dog in his presence. It's a part of him. I have learned to really enjoy his pet and love it too. We are both older, our kids are out in the world mostly but mine are still a bit younger.  I have a 17 year old at home with me full time and a 10 year old part of the time. His 2 kids are both married and in their 20's. On the first date we talked about never wanting any more kids and not getting more pets. 

Well, life happened. The cat my kid dropped off at my house had a kitten. The kitten grew, my 17 year old who has had some pretty substantial emotional issues fell in love with the kitten. Like, these two beings are inseparable. The momma cat disappeared. 6 monthes later the kitten still exists in our house. My 17 year old is taking full ownership of the kitten. He has gotten the shots and has an appointment next week to get it fixed. He understands when he leaves our house he has to take little Arnold (cats name) with him. He will spend the next 2 years here at home for college in state but may have to travel after that. 

Boyfriend moved in about the time all this cat drama was happening. He is angry that the cat is still here and that I have not kept up my end of the no new pets deal. We had a big fight today and he said it was him or the cat. 

It's not the cat that I would be choosing though. It's my son I have to choose here. To get rid of his pet for a guy seems pretty wrong. So, I might be the asshole here. I dont know. I feel like I can't win this one either way."	Not the A-hole	0	0

byfztg	2019-06-09 03:15:00	skysder	AITA because I got mad at a friend for leaving me to play with someone else while we were online?	"Context:

To start off, I was playing a Minecraft survival game with my very good friend when a mutual we know from school joins our game. He starts demanding that I make him a moderator even though this is my custom world and I’ve been using it for nearly a year. He was being very persistent and asking me to turn him to creative mode and I kept saying no. I told him multiple times that this is a survival world and he’s going to stay in such mode.

Eventually he starts calling me names in the chat (just a bunch of swear words really) and he’s spamming the chat by spelling out each word with one letter. At the point I was really annoyed and took away his building privileges by setting him to “visitor” mode. 

He realizes I did that and starts cussing me out in the chat once more. This time however, he says to my friend;

“hey [FRIEND] let’s start our own survival world and leave [MY NAME]”. 

After asking three times for my friend to join him, my friend (who I was on a call with) said they were going to go and play with him. I asked her why and she didn’t give any clear or concise answer. I hung up and texted her asking why she did that. I was clearly angry and at the same time I felt like I was overacting a bit but she just decided to leave the game without any warning. After that she kept on ignoring me.

She still hasn’t replied but I’m not in too much of a hurry to find out her answer."	Asshole	0	0

I did not understand the reason behind this. He tried explaining but was too dunk to tell my why.

I told him he can have a chair from the kitchen if it helps but he went straight for my roomates doors.

I told that they are absent and they locked the doors to their rooms. I didn't want him to sleep in my room with me since i have never seen him before so i told him that he can't sleep here.

"So, Sunday night my friend/colleague and I were out at a local bar having a drink and it was quite hot outside.

byfx3j	2019-06-09 03:05:56		AITA for being mad that my mom excessively complains about favors done for her that aren’t exactly perfect?	"So, my mom just likes to complain about everything. She’ll spend at least thirty minutes a day complaining about people at her work or things that happened at work. Everything frustrates her and she just has anger issues. I would say 80% of the things that come out of her mouth are long-winded complaints. I’ve just learned to ignore these rants as much as I can. 


I’m in college (21F) and living at home because my job doesn’t pay well enough for me to move out. I’ve been saving for literally years but something always happens that drains my savings whether it’s car trouble, a health issue, or something else. I just don’t have the means to get out of the situation I’m in. 


I am very thankful that my parents allow me to live with them and pay very little in rent. I just don’t know what to do. 


**Anyway,** it’s my mom’s birthday tomorrow and she’s been asking for weeks for someone to bring the patio cushions and covers up from the basement, iron them, and put them outside. When my parents were out grocery shopping I brought all the cushions up, put all the covers on them, and put them outside. They’re tight enough that I didn’t think they needed to be ironed. The wrinkles are barely visible. I didn’t have time to iron them before they got home anyway. 


When my mom saw the cushions covers were on and outside she said “thank you but they’re so wrinkly!” And continued to complain about how we would have to take the covers off, iron them, and put them back on for the next 5 or so minutes. 


I don’t know how to tell her that complaining about a favor someone did for you to that extent is just not okay. If she had thanked me and then later said that we should iron them that would be fine but immediately taking back your appreciation with five minutes of complaining really makes me never want to do another favor for her ever again. 


So, am I being a complete asshole here? Remember, ESH (everyone is shitty here) is a thing, too. I’ll definitely take this down if people feel like i’m breaking rule 8. I just don’t know."	Asshole	1	0

me and my girlfriend have been dating for 2 years, I'm 25 and my girlfriend is 24. 

last week my brother shared a post from a weed lovers Facebook page and included a funny caption. he has 2 kids and almost never smokes weed, maeby once a month at the most, and the kids are never home when he does. he also has no weed paraphernalia at his house. 

my girlfriend saw the post and questioned me on it, I explained exactly what I just told you and reassured her that the kids are fine. 

I then get a call from my brother a few days later, telling me that someone called CPS on him as they just did a welfare check on his kids. I automatically knew it was my girlfriend and confronted her, she told me that weed is bad for you and she was only thinking in the kids best interests. 

I just started yelling at her. 

I told her that I had explained to her how little weed he uses and that it's never kept at the house, I was beyond mad and made sure she knew that, I explained that she called CPS on a man who smokes weed once a month and that she is the worst person I've ever met. this caused her to start crying and she sobbed In the shower for an hour, and then tried apologizing but I refused her apology i also told her to not even bother apologizing to my brother as he does not want to see her. 
I then broke up with her. 

now I've accepted that we have broken up but now that my brain has cleared up I think I went a step to far and really need outside judgment on this. 

I'm just a complete mess of emotions.

byfw09	2019-06-09 03:02:22		AITA for not letting my wife in my phone	"So.... had to repost for not putting AITA in the title. Oops. Noobs will be noobs

Mobile. So you know. I'm TA for that. 

I won't make it long, or in depth. My(24) life is an open book for my wife (23). Except for my phone. It's the ONLY thing I have to myself. My only privacy and it's important to me. We spend every waking moment together that we aren't at work. I honestly can't remember the last time I've done anything without her in 3 years. 

So, having something that is mine and not hers is important. Being able to browse reddit, look at porn, or bitch about shit to friends without her reading through and asking me questions is needed since its the only way for me to do anything without her. 

And when I say ONLY I mean only. Woman talks to me while I'm in the shitter for christ sake. 

Her point of view is that I'd only keep it from her if I was hiding something. My point of view is that since she is a part of every other aspect of my life aside from a physically demanding job with one 20 minute break per day, I need something that is mine. 

Note that this has been a rule of mine from day 1, and that while she doesn't care with her phone, I never touch it unless she specifically tells me to. I will reciprocate the boundary I ask for, I am not a hypocrite in this.

So reddit, AITA for insisting she keep off my phone? Do I seem like im hiding something? Since we are married do I just need to give in and get it over with?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
byfvwp	2019-06-09 03:02:05		WIBTA for asking my SO to reconsider a vacation with friends	"So, in about a week, my SO and I move into our first home together. Eleven days after the move, my SO leaves to go on a cross country road trip with his group of friends from high school.

Some backstory stuff: He knew about our move in date before the trip was planned. I feel like this is a huge step in our relationship, to move in together, and as soon as we move in, he is leaving for an entire two weeks. I will be stuck with the majority of unpacking by myself, as well as doing multiple other things alone that I feel should be done as a pair when living together.  I feel like I will get all used to the house while he's gone and he will come back feeling like a stranger in a home I am already comfortable in. 

This trip has been terribly planned from the start. One group member decided ALL the activities for everyone; no one else got a say. They have already lost money from booking/unbooking various places to stay. My SO did not even know the name of the town they are going to be staying in until a few days ago. This group is also notorious for just sitting in the house on their phones the entire time they go somewhere, even if there is a million fun things to do! My SO has been complaining about all this non-stop but still wants to go.

They will be driving 12 hours a day for 2 days straight. None of the drivers have ever made a trip like this before. This also costs more money than just flying, but no one likes that idea, apparently. My SO refuses to fly by himself because he thinks it will be a dick move to let everyone else drive. I don't really get this thought process but, whatever. 

Money is another issue, as half the people going are deep in debt/without jobs. My SO and I are having to spend a good chunk of money to move and he is expressing concerns about money now because of this trip but is unwilling to cut costs for the trip and instead complains about having to pay so much for our utilities. 

I would never EVER tell him what to do. I am not his mother, this is his money to spend, and I really do want him to be able to go have fun with his friends! I just feel like our move is not being taken into consideration. He also has had very little positive things to say about this vacation and says his main reason for going is to ""be able to say 'I told you so"" when it all falls apart."" That really rubbed me the wrong way for some reason. 

Would I be the asshole if I asked (not demanded) that he reconsider going on this trip? I wouldn't give him any ultimatums or any stupid shit like that, just have a conversation expressing my concerns and ask him to rethink things. I want to tell him why I am upset about this, but I also do not want to guilt him into not going, and have him resent me for that. I genuinely can't tell if I'm being an asshole for being so upset over this and would just like to know if I am in the wrong with this, please."		1	0

byfvcw	2019-06-09 03:00:16	notrealme123	AITA for not surprising my(27m) GF(28f) with gifts?	"Background: Been dating for 4 years, GF is terrible at receiving gifts because she cant hide her reactions well. I am great at it, I have received some gifts I would not purchase for myself but nevertheless expressed nothing but happiness to her because its about the thoughts.  She also has a very specific taste with what she likes and dont. No specific style or genre, if it clicks with her she gets obsessed over it, if she thinks its ugly, it could be a 50k diamond necklace and she would hate it. 

Year 1 when I was a broke student and didn't know about all of the above, I dipped into my savings to surprise her with a $200 necklace, and it was not received well. She didnt throw a fit or anything, just couldnt hide the fact that she didnt like the gift. I got a little sour over her reaction, we ended up talking it out and returned it for something else she liked. 

Since then, I've asked her to tell me exactly what she wants as gifts before big holidays. Sometimes when she has, I've gotten them for her and she loved it, still uses it to this day. When she doesnt, we usually plan a trip or a dinner (she loves good food) instead which I pay for. 

For our 4th year anniversary, same thing was communicated and she didnt mention there was anything she wanted. So we planned a weekend trip + dinner for us and it was implied throughout that there would be no gift (i didnt expect one from her either). When we checked in to our hotel, she surprised me with galaxy buds and I was ecstatic. But when I told her the trip was my gift, she expressed her disappointment. She then sort of vented that she wanted me to put more thoughts and surprise her with a gift once in a while without having to tell me what she wanted. 

I dont get why she pushes for this so much when she knows she picky and she wouldnt be able to hide her reactions to gifts she does not like. Theres also a part of me that makes me feel like I wasted my money when shes not happy about her gift.

The main reason he is my former friend is due to an incident where one of my other friends was teasing him and he started trying to beat me up. Why? I have no idea, he didn't go after the other guy. The other reasons I don't like him (and most others I know don't either) are because he is rude, rather stubborn and has a general lack of hygiene. He would repeatedly harass/annoy me and my friends and have significant disregard for our personal space. Due to the particular incident with him and the fact that I still have to interact with him afterwards, I hate him significantly more than most.

A few days ago, when two of my friends were walking to lunch, my former friend offers one of them a cigarette. They told me this story because they found it rather amusing that he smoked. Knowing full well that his mom was very strict and highly disapproved of him even considering smoking, and assuming she didn't know already, I messaged his mom telling her what I knew, to which she thanked me for telling her.

I felt like he was a jerk with his reaction and could’ve been nicer about how he didn’t want me there. I thought it was a good opportunity to go to a place I’ve always wanted to go while also seeing friends who would be there at the same time. I expressed and planned to do my own thing while I was there and only wanted to meet up with them for a day or two. I’ve expressed this again to him while also wishing him a good trip but with no response. I understand he wants to have his own time there but feel like he could’ve communicated it better when I asked what he thought.

We have new neighbours that moved in last year, and all summer, all day Saturday and Sunday, they host noisy parties where they scream, shout, and play loud music from about 2 pm until 1-2 am. I can hear them from every room in our house, including the basement. 

So, this summer it's finally nice enough to be outdoors, and their parties have started again. They also got a dog recently, and from the sound of it they've been throwing things at it and yelling at it too, as I'll hear a loud thud and then the dog screaming, followed by them yelling at it to shut up. 

I'm not a confrontational person, but I have gone to their door and asked them to please keep it down, and explained why. However, I only spoke to their housekeeper, and haven't been able to speak to the homeowner. 

WIBTA if I reported them to the city? They are technically in violation of the noise restrictions of the city, and I have videos and audio recordings to prove it. I also recently became aware that their dog is not licensed, so there would be a fine for that too. I'm also concerned that they're abusing their dog, given what I've heard recently. 

I was also thinking of leaving a copy of the relevant city policy in their mailbox and giving them a chance to change their behaviour before I reported them, but I thought that might be petty. That said, they are new to the area, so maybe they just haven't had close neighbours before?

Normally, I would have no problem reporting them. But my parents said I'm being an idiot, and that they have the right to party as much as they want. But don't I have a right to peace in my home as well? Per the city bylaws, I'm in the right, but I don't want to start a big fight.

Update: So what I ended up doing was taping the bylaw to their door this morning, because I feel I should give them a fair chance to correct their behaviour before getting fined or having the police called on them. I did call the city last night to ask about what would happen if I reported them, and in the process I found out that not only is there no dog licensed at their address, they also don't have the city-required fencing on their property to have a dog. So we'll see what happens."	Not the A-hole	0	0

byfr77	2019-06-09 02:46:25	Snullison	AITA for cancelling a trip w/a friend because i got a job	"Ive had a rough childhood and have basically had to raise myself. I lost my mother when I was 11 and at that time i hadnt seen my father in 6 years. We went to live with him. He didnt know how to take care of children all of the sudden. When I turned 15 I got a studentjob so Id have some money to buy clothes and food. I was a very closed person and never let anyone in. I started college.The first year went very well. I also left home and lived in a schoolresidency i could afford with my scholarship and the money i earned from my weekendjob. As the years went by i got very tired mentally. I became severely depressed and i felt lonely.i couldnt keep up. I started skipping school, lost friends, relationship was having troubles, i gained weight and got more depressed. I ended my 4.5 year relationship because i was so unhappy and just didnt know what to do anymore. After that I decided to quit school and take time for myself. To relax and to get away. 

A friend of mine. Lets call her Anne, proposed we go on a trip together. She was also in a though spot at home and needed time away to think and get away from it all. I proposed we go do volunteerwork on a farm in France for a montg. We started planning and picked out a farm (was via a website) We wanted to go ASAP so we planned a month in advance. All we'd need to pay was transportation.  
In the meantime i started applying for jobs. I got a bit scared because i knew id have to move out of the appartement soon. 
I got a jobinterview and immediately got the job. I was very very happy and excited. I told them about my plans to go to France and asked if it was ok for me to start when i returned. They agreed. 
After thinking it over I realised how much work i would have in preperation for the job. I had to look for an appartement, go back to sign my contract and get laptop, mental preperation,.. I also wanted to save every penny I have because id have to live on my own soon. I was thinking about cancelling France. It would mean i could start my job sooner. Also because by now it was 6 days until the trip and we didnt even book transportation yet. 
I approached Anne about having doubts but she read my message and didnt reply. I asked her if she wanted to meet up and talk about it. At that time i hadnt even made my decision yet and wanted to talk it over. She replied and told me that I shouldnd have applied and she was mad. She didnt say much. I understood her anger and her dissapointment, but i guess i had hoped she would also be more understanding. Up until now i wonder if i should have done things differently. I was upset myself that i had to cancel because i really wanted to go myself. I still stand by my choice because i needed to move forward. Create my own safety and start my life. This job is a big part of that and im proud. But i do still feel very bad. Im just not sure what i should have done otherwise. Amitheassholehere?"	Asshole	0	0
byfq7o	2019-06-09 02:43:18	hypepshen	AITA for being uncomfortable with my brother being gay?	"Recently, my brother [16M] came out as gay to our family, at dinner. Notably, my parents were pretty shocked at first, asking him if he was sure he was gay, but quickly turned to telling him they were proud of him and would support any decision he makes.

My [12F] sister was amused by the preceding, and told everyone she had seen it coming.

Outwardly, I (jokingly) told my bro that he should set up a Grindr account, to which my parents yelled “No!” at me. I’ve told him that I’m proud too that he felt comfortable enough to come out to us.

Inwardly, I don’t think I’ll ever look at my brother the same. I’m not against him being gay, but I’m just not totally comfortable with this, especially if he starts bringing other guys home in bed and such.

I haven’t expressed any of my misgivings to him,  and I never will. Personally, I think that makes this all okay.

But, when I talked to my sister about this, she called me a homophobe and an asshole, saying that we’re family and that I should support him, which is what I think I’ve been doing. I’ve only had thoughts about this, but haven’t taken and action or words about it.

So, AITA for being uncomfortable with my brother being gay?

EDIT: So I got a bunch of responses. Most YTA comments were about me being homophobic, and how this isn’t any of my business. I disagree with the homophobic part, but the not my business part I do agree with. Thanks!

Most NTA/NAH’s are about how it is okay to be uncomfortable, but I should gradually make my way to accepting him. 

This I agree with. I disagree with the NTA/NAH’s that say I’m on 14. Sure, I’m ‘only’ fourteen, but this means I’ve have 14 years to built family bond that should be stronger than this, and which I hope will become in the future.

Thanks for all the comments!"	Asshole	0	0
byfpuo	2019-06-09 02:42:04		AITA for not letting this lady in front of me?	"I was driving through construction, and the lane to my right was closing in a few blocks. Right lane merge left.

I try to keep a little room in front of me regardless, but Car A decided it was an invitation to merge in a few car lengths ahead of the merge.

That was frustrating, but what was even more frustrating was Car B and Car C zooming through the empty space past my lane at a near stand still, and them merging in front of Car A. It would be one thing if they had to clear an intersection or something, but the nearest available turnoff behind us was blocks back.

It's Car D I was likely the asshole to.

It was this white Porsche SUV, and it *would* have been in position to go well  behind me had Cars A-C not messed up the whole thing, but now I was positioned a car-length or two back.

I thought: ""Easy fix. I let through my share. I get it's bread and butter, but Car D had to have seen this butter already spread over too much bread. I'll just pop in front of her. All's fair. In love and construction traffic.""

But she didn't hold back, even when I made it clear I wasn't making way for her. She just kept pushing in until her rear fender grazed my front bumper.

I get that legally she was obliged to yield, and it wasn't the most considerate move on my part, but she had just buzzed right past two or three openings to cram in front of me!

my sister and me are not super close but I still love her and want the best for her. 
I'm 25f my sister is 27. 

my wedding is in 6 months and so I sent out the invitations, anyone that had a partner would get a extra little bit of info about having a plus one. 

I got a call from my sister asking me why she was not allowed a plus one, I told her that she did not have a partner so I did not include it.  turns out she has been dating this man for 2 weeks and wants to invite him. 
I told her that it was a no and that only she can go, she seemed annoyed and hung up. 

she then went crying to mum about it who kinda took her side, she also made a few cryptic posts that where clearly talking about me. and so I told my sister that if she was going to cry to people over not being able to bring her boyfriend of 2 weeks to my wedding, I would rather you not go. 
that caused her to burst into tears and I've not heard from her since.

byfot7	2019-06-09 02:38:32		AITA for telling my mom to “shut the f*ck up”?	So for context, I (18M) live with my grandfather and have for basically my entire life. I won’t get into details but this was basically because my mother was incapable of taking care of me. Recently over the past year or so my mom has been living with us on and off because she’s apparently gotten her act together and my grandfather is allowing it(even though multiple guys have showed up at my house demanding to know where she’s at and one guy even came by and shot at her dog). Well for the past week I was on a trip and while I was gone my mom had fixed some broken boards under my bed and had changed out my old mattress with a spare that we had. When I got back a few days ago she told me not to let my dog on my bed (which she can’t really do since it isn’t her house nor her dog nor her bed and I’m a legal adult) So fast forward to today and she was doing something around the house and she was in a pissed off mood and just yelling at me for little things (which isn’t new for her) Anyways she passed by my room and saw that the dog was on my bed and she went absolute ape-shit. She started yelling at me telling me how ungrateful I am and no matter how many times I tried to calm her down to just talk things out she was just incapable of having a conversation. She then got pissed at the dog and was saying that I was going to come home one day and that my dog would be gone. This isn’t the first time something like this has gone down and I guess the fact that she was threatening to take my dog set me off and I just told her to “shut the fuck up”. She then started yelling even louder and crying telling me that she’s done with me and she’ll never talk to me again. I don’t think I’m in the wrong here and I wanted another opinion.

byfndg	2019-06-09 02:33:48		AITA for hanging up on my boyfriend’s “mom”?	"My [24f] boyfriend [26m] have been dating just shy of two years. He calls his best friend’s mom “mom”, I haven’t met her yet. Anyways, he got last minute tickets from his mom to a video game expo at a hotel this morning, and left around noon with his best friend. I had not heard from him all day long except for one text at 3pm that was “this place is wild”. He was posting on his Snapchat story all day long, so I know he wasn’t kidnapped or anything. I had been texting him all day long- after 3- and he didn’t open any of them, read receipts, ya know. I have work tomorrow morning, at this point it’s 10pm and I’m getting ready for bed. I decide to call him. He answers and the conversation goes like this 

Him: hello?

Me: where have you been?

Him: *very clearly drunk* I’ve been sleeping

Me: you’ve been sleeping since three?

Him: yeah

Me: where are you sleeping

Him: I got a hotel room 

Me: you haven’t been sleeping since three I saw your snapchats 

Him: I’ve been sleeping since three, I’ll prove it 

So this is where I remember his mom is the event coordinator and actually has a hotel room herself, which they likely decided to crash there. He puts his mom on the phone at this point. 

Mom: hello?

Me: hey I’m just going to go, please take care of him

Mom: you don’t want to talk to him?

Me: no I really don’t, please have a good night 

And then I hang up. When I pressed the hang up key, I realized that she had been saying something but it was too late. Now I feel like an asshole for hanging up on a woman taking care of my drunk boyfriend. But part of me also thinks that it was a cheap move on his part to put me on the phone with his mom when he knew I was furious. I don’t want her to not like me. Should I be mad still when we talk tomorrow? Or AITA now for not talking to his mom?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
byfnct	2019-06-09 02:33:44		WIBTA if I told my friend I don’t want to hear about her previous relationship?	"Now, don’t read the title and assume I’m the asshole already. Hear me out.

My friend (f) went out with this guy who I guess had his ex over. I don’t think anything happened but my friend thinks something did. Anyways, they get in a fight and break up and 7-8 months later, she’s still on about it. Now I should probably mention that we went out 3-4 times and she broke up with me all those times for no reason (I really didn’t care). She also used me for money and shit all those times we went out. Every time I talk to her I expect to talk about normal things, not her previous relationship. Each time I hear another story about it I want to remind her of what she did to me and my cousin (he also went out with her and did the same thing to him). It got to the point where I almost told her I really don’t give two fucks. The only reason I haven’t said it is because I think I’d be an asshole for saying those things. Now I get it, being cheated on sucks I got cheated on twice, but every time I want to have a nice normal conversation she always has to bring up the previous relationship. I’ve even told her to go to an actual therapist if she’s having problems. 

So WIBTA if I told her I don’t care next time she brings it up?"		1	0

byfmih	2019-06-09 02:31:06	Blippetybloo	AITA for not being willing to use a tampon to go to a water park with my friends?	"Two friends and I made a plan to go to an amusement park tomorrow, which has a big water park we were planning to go to. We already bought our tickets, but our tickets are not restricted to a particular day, we can use our ticket for any day of the season. 

So my period just started, I've always used pads and I don't want to try a tampon. I know it's stupid, and I have no logical reason not to try it - but I just find it gross and I don't like the idea of the tampon staying inside my vagina for hours and collecting blood, it just seems really gross and I would not feel comfortable with it at all..it just seems so gross (again, it's not logical, my friend pointed out that pads are probably just as gross). 

My friend's trying to convince me to either use a tampon or wait in the side for the couple hours they spend in the water park. I frankly don't want to do either, I paid for this ticket and would rather spend it on another day that I can actually go to the water park and not waste up to 4-5 hours just doing nothing. One of the friend has a season pass, my other friend is only gonna go to the park tomorrow, she doesn't wanna pay for more visits, so tomorrow was the day we would all go and go to the water park and everything. 

But my friend is annoyed that I won't just use a tampon, she said ""it's not like you haven't had anything in your vagina before"" (I've had sex and my reason for not using a tampon is not really a religious one..my reasoning is just illogical and I agree that it's illogical but it's just something I don't want to try). 

AITA for probably bailing last minute on this plan and going another day instead? I know my friend is gonna be really upset if I bail...I know for sure she's going to be really annoyed and mad that I cancelled last minute.

Edit: thanks everyone for your insights, really appreciated them. I've talked to my friend and while she was, and still is, upset, we're okay now and she and I will just go another day. The other friend (without the season pass) will go tomorrow with my friend with the season pass."	No A-holes here	0	0

Bf and I have been together 6+ years, live together, etc. His family goes on a yearly trip to a major river and stay at a nice resort, take their boats out and have a good time. We went last year and had a lot of fun and I was looking forward to going again this year. 

Recently Bf and I went on a nice trip for our birthdays and both spent a good amount of money and we both have other responsibilities to take care of at the moment so we mutually decided that we were going to skip the river trip this year along with another trip we have been taking annually. 

River trip is a next weekend and he tells me last night that his dad has an extra room at the resort and wants Bf to go. He's now thinking of going and can make it work financially. Money isn't what I'm worried about but the problem is that since we said we weren't going I had made other plans that weekend- Saturday a birthday party for my best friend and Sunday is Father's Day so I was talking with my mom about what to do for my dad that day. 
He doesn't get why I'm a little upset that he's  planning on going but I'm mad because if I thought there was a chance we would still go I wouldn't have made other plans and it sucks that I'm going to miss out on a fun weekend. So, AITA? 

He doesn't see my point of view he doesn't see why I'd be upset that ""plans change"" and thinks a weeks notice is enough. I'm definitely more of a planner and he's more spontaneous and I don't want to bail on my friends birthday so this has caused an argument for sure. What could make me an asshole is that I told him I'll be mad at him if he goes and he thinks I'm letting my emotions get the best of me"		1	0

byfizo	2019-06-09 02:19:10	Vegetarian16	AITA for wanting to go home?	"I lived in Ohio & my cousin does travel nursing and right now she’s in Washington. She said I could come live with her and get a job because my home situation wasn’t that great. My cousin & her husband make good money & have a nice RV since they travel. I got here to Washington May 29th and after only a few days here, I wanted to go home. I missed everyone, my boyfriend, and my cats. On top of that, my other reasons for going home are as follows: 
My bed is small & I can’t even sit upright on it. I feel like they’re being aggressive with my dog. Their Rottweiler growled so the husband took him into their room where he beat him (or so I think based on the sounds) and yelled at him to the point where he made this full grown Rottweiler pee himself which broke my heart. My dog is a lab & I don’t want him to turn out to be aggressive. There is not enough food here. I constantly have to walk to a gas station to buy snacks so that I’m not starving. I have to cross a highway a few times & I don’t feel safe. Multiple times they’ve went to go eat and not offered to take me or get me something or even tell me they were leaving. I only know because I heard them. I would’ve even offered to buy my own food. Today, I only ate 2 bagels. 
I feel like I’m on my own and she’s just acting like a bitch. For example, I needed a crate for my dog on the plane ride back. I was carrying a giant crate with one hand and a puppy on a leash with the other & she didn’t offer to help me at all. I was bumping into things & even kicked something off of a shelf that I couldn’t pick up. Her husband acts like a total dick to me for no reason. Earlier today my puppy pooped on the floor & he said I should’ve taken him out for longer than 30 seconds. I took him out before I fed him and he peed but I hadn’t even gotten to take him out to poop yet. I heard them talking shit on me when they thought I was sleeping. They also say stuff to my face which they think is hilarious but isn’t funny at all. I’m a vegetarian & they’re vegan (although loosely) and they ate chicken for dinner which I was forced to eat because they had nothing else. I was worried it was going to make me sick since I haven’t eaten meat in almost 2 years but thankfully it hasn’t. They say they’re the mom & dad of my dog which sounds stupid but annoys me. They have 3 dogs of their own but they say “Come to mommy”, stuff like that. I paid for the dog. He’s mine. They put a picture of my dog on their fridge. I jokingly asked why & my cousin said “We have to have a picture of all the kids on the fridge.” My cousin is mad that I wanna go back. She said I’m the last person she’d expect to do this & basically she feels like she was walked all over & she doesn’t like it. I just miss home. She doesn’t understand. She has her husband. I have nobody. Anyway, am I the asshole for wanting to go home? No, my home life isn’t the best which is why I left but at least I’d be fed & be familiar with things."	Not the A-hole	0	0
byfixq	2019-06-09 02:19:01		AITA, but she’s bi-polar	I'm not going through the entire last 13years because it would tak too long. But my wife is on disability for fibromyalgia she was just granted this last year or so. I do all the cooking in the house, the majority of the cleaning. I work 40-50 hours a week and have been going to school for the past year so I can get a better job to get our family in a better place. This year alone she has been in the mental ward at the hospital twice. They finally diagnosed her as bi-polar. Due to issues we've had with money in years before now, I have my own checking account. Basically two or three times she has blown all our money and we've not had anything to pay bills. Anyway, now when she gets her disability, she gives me a portion to help with bills and she keeps the rest. She'll get her check and 2 days later she's broke. So she borrows money from me to do what she wants afterwards. We have 2 kids in the home. Currently, I work, take classes online, I do all the grocery shopping. I do the cooking.  I get home from work and she's laying in bed asleep. After this last stint in the hospital, she got out and has gotten three new tattoos and gotten her nose pierced. Which I hate. No offense to anyone that has one, but to me it's disgusting. Ok, no big deal. Just a marriage with no sex. Been happening for years right?  THEN she takes our 13 year old daughter and gets her nose pierced WITHOUT talking to me. This is an issue, I told her this was something she shouldn't have done. Anyway.. I eventually let it go. Then earlier this week I find out that she has stolen a credit card out of my wallet and has been using it for about 2 weeks. Spent about 400 bux on it. But I'm trying to get my credit in place so I can get us our own house. I am pissed beyond what you can imagine. I can not stand being lied to, whichd she has done several times in the past. Then finally this is the last straw. So I told her, I don't think I can get passed it. She asks if we are done and I reply pretty much. I did NOT kick her out of the house, but I cannot look at her the same way. There have been a lot of things going on that I have not mentioned because it would turn out to be a book on here. I have told her that right now she does not have to leave the home. We have 2 kids here and they want her around. But I cannot trust her again. Am I the asshole?	Not the A-hole	1	0

The group consisted of two guys (Ed and Chris), one girl (Maggie), and yours truly [M]. Our topic was about substance abuse. Mostly, things were great since we were brainstorming ideas and assigning roles to each member. While we were working, we talked about our personal lives to try and get to know each other. We discussed what high schools we went to, our family life, etc. Soon, the conversation took an awkward turn. Ed and Maggie began talking about their drinking, drugs, and sex. Maggie started talking about how she lost her virginity when she was 13 and how they boy she lost it to was 12. I was starting to feel quite uncomfortable. She was describing how it happened, which is when I interrupted her and politely asked her if she could please save it for later. She gave me a weird look and asked why. I said I didn't want to hear about how she lost her virginity when she was a minor. I explained that I wasn't comfortable hearing about two minors having sex. She did not take this well. An argument ensued, as she told me that ""people f*ck all the time, get over yourself"". I told her that's not the point, and she snaps with ""Keep that up, and you'll stay a virgin"". At that point, I packed up my belongings and left. So far, I haven't made any contact with them and I'm not sure how to proceed. AITA here?"	Not the A-hole	1	0
byfir4	2019-06-09 02:18:22	Throwaway08192283	AITA for ignoring someone at an event after they ignored me for 2 years?	"There is a woman I know who’s daughter goes to the same daycare as my daughter. They originally were in the same class together and in early 2017, the whole class got an invite to her daughters birthday party. I went and got a nice gift and didn’t really know her well, so I was excited to possibly meet a new friend. 

When I went there, she was extremely standoffish. I excitedly said hello to her and she just said “hi” and then walked away and didn’t speak to me the rest of the party. There were about 10 other kids there and I saw her speak with other parents. I thought it was odd but thought maybe she was just trying to cater to everyone. 

So, in the months following the party, every time I saw this woman at daycare while we were either dropping off or picking up our kids, she completely ignored me. I see her about 3 times a week. We would literally be walking towards each other in a small hallway, I would always attempt to make eye contact and say hi, and she would pretend she didn’t hear. After awhile I started ignoring her too but this was after several times over several months of trying to be nice if I saw her. She was always really talkative with other people, so I don’t know why she treated me that way. But I had no interest in finding out. 

So recently we were at a local carnival like event  and she saw me, called me by my name, and came up to me and asked me a question about finding something in the carnival, and I looked at her and  walked away from her. I didn’t say a word to her, even though there was no way she could think I didn’t hear her. 

My mom, and husband saw this happen.  She also ignores both of them and they agree that she’s not nice. But even they were like, whoa, you shouldn’t have done that. 

However I feel like, why should I be nice to someone who stuck their nose up to me for no reason for 2 years? AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
byfhzd	2019-06-09 02:15:49	forseti-spaghetti	AITA for being jealous of my best friend and girlfriend's closeness?	"  
First post to this reddit, since this whole situation has left me really distraught and I don't know if I'm in the wrong. Sorry if the names are confusing, I didn't really know what else to put.

&#x200B;

So me and my best friend (who I will refer to as B) have been friends for basically our whole lives, and we're very close. We live several states apart, so most of our communication is via the internet.  
A few months ago she introduced me to this other girl (who I will refer to as C) who she'd recently met, and we alongside a few other internet friends started talking.  
I'd notice that B and C were getting *really* close, and they would always say stuff like ""oh you're my best friend!"" ""you're the LOML"" and shit in right front of me (since we all chat in the same discord servers most of the time.) It made me pretty jealous, so I confronted B about it and she assured me C wasn't replacing me, and that we were still best friends.  
It still kinda irked me but whatever, I got over it. Me and C started talking a lot more and I developed a bit of a crush on her, and eventually we started dating.  
Things were going fine for a while, but recently I've started to feel more excluded. C and I don't talk as much, but apparently her and B talk *all the time.*  


I'm jealous because I feel like C likes B more than me, and that B acts like her and C are best friends. Am I the asshole here? I love both of them dearly, but their closeness bothers me."	Not enough info	0	0

byffxe	2019-06-09 02:09:15	hurt-andconfused	AITA for staying friends with someone who has been homophobic to another friend in the past?	"Throwaway and names changed to protect everyone’s privacy.

About 18 months - 2 years ago, my very close friend, Bill, came out to our extended friend group as gay. At the time they were met with unconditional support, (as far as I am aware) from everyone in the group. For context, we all attended a Christian high school, and some of us, though not myself and not Bill, identify as christian.

Around 8 months ago we were all discussing the ethics of christianity as it relates to issues of sexuality. One of my close friends, Josh, stated that his personal belief is that homosexuality is a sin, but no more or less grievous than the sin inherent in all of us. He stated that he believes God commands him to love unconditionally and to not judge lest he be judged. He has always been supportive and loving toward Bill, and never treated him the slightest bit differently after Bill came out, as far as I am aware.

Somewhat understandably, Bill took offence and decided to end his friendship with Josh. That’s his prerogative and I completely understand the choice he made. I disagree with Josh and since then we have had many conversations about the homophobia inherent in the statement that homosexual acts are a sin, even if this belief does not come with hatred or judgement. He has since changed his views on this issue and I feel comfortable calling him an incredibly close friend.

However, Bill has taken offence at the fact that I continue to hang out with Josh, and has made it known to me in no uncertain terms. He hasn’t come out and told me to stop hanging out with him, but he has expressed his frustration that I would hang out with “a bigot”.

Am I the asshole for being upset that Bill is inserting himself into my personal relationship with someone else? 

I don’t believe it is his business, and while I can understand why he would be insecure, I am really pissed off that he is angry with me. The way I see it, what is between him and Josh and myself and Josh are two completely separate matters. Am I an asshole for calling Bill on this and getting angry?

EDIT - I’m seeing some arguing in the comments. I have been trying my best to remain civil but I want to remind you all this is a sensitive topic for many LGBT people, and to be aware of how our speech may affect people struggling with their identity. The issue of this post was never whether the belief that homosexuality is a sin makes you an asshole or not. Homosexuality is not a sin, it is not a choice, it is a valid identity, and it would be shitty of me to hold these beliefs so strongly and not challenge people who hold the opposing belief out of respect for their religious values.

There is a way to have these conversations with religious people respectfully - but LGBT people are under NO OBLIGATION to educate and be patient with religious people who deny the validity of their existence.

The desk announces that the flight is going to be full and that they will check bags for free to make enough room for everyone. I am in boarding group 6 out of 9 and think that I don’t want to deal with the impending mess on the plane and I check my carryon, and keep my backpack that has a laptop, iPad, and my noise cancelling earphones. 

Desk comes over the loudspeaker again to beg for people to check their bags and they say specifically that group 8 and 9 will not have any space to put their bags, so please come and check them. 

So I board the plane and sit down and am the first person to put my backpack up above me in the bin. The plane and bins fill up fast and on comes “Karen”. She is searching every bin for space and finally comes all the way to my seat and says, “whose red bag is this?”

I reply that it is mine and she asks if I’ll move it to below the seat in front of me. And I just said, “no thanks!” She got an offended look and said, “why not?”  I told her that I’m over 6’ tall and I want to have my leg space so I don’t cramp up. She then dramatically sighs and I say, “you could have checked that bag for free, I was here first, don’t try to make me feel bad about it.”  She responded saying that she had a laptop in her bag and couldn’t check it, and I said, “so do I.”

The flight attendant observed the whole exchange and never stepped in, so I thought issue over and enjoyed the leg room!

On the way off the plane Karen was waiting for everyone to exit so she could go back to the end of the plane and get her suitcase, and as I walked by her she called me an asshole under her breath.

My boyfriend and I have a cute little rabbit about about 3 years old and she’s just the sweetest thing you’ve ever laid eyes on. I love her so much and take caring for her very seriously as do my boyfriend. We are great pet parents. We do have a same issue. When we first got her, she’s was given to use by a friend who moved to Nevada, we took lots of pictures to to remember cute moments. My boyfriend would usually share these photos with his friends, but mostly with a female friend of which he dated  before me for a short time. At first I was like no big whoops! She’s cute share it with world! But then it became so constant I started to feel weird about it. Like there would be times our rabbit would do something cute and I would snap a picture just for myself and he would almost instantly ask me to send it to his female friend or send it to him so he can send it to her. 

I know him and his female friend are huge animal lovers like myself but this made me feel weird about it. Like he only has interest in showing her first since she is literally the first person to get it MOST of the time. So now I start taking pictures when he’s not looking or around. 

Problem is he now knows I have the pictures and asked me to share them with him. I don’t want to because I’m 90% sure he’s just going to send them to her! 

I think he also uses these as a way to talk to her since she’s really friendly and sweet. I don’t think of him cheating or anything, but this behavior is weird, and embarrassing for me if it’s true that this is one of his reasons for doing so.  We spoke about this briefly and he said he just sends them to her for the same reason he does his other friends, because they like animals. But I didn’t really buy that since it’s never random, and she’s usually first. 

So AITA for not sending him the pictures of our pet rabbit?"		1	0

byfdnn	2019-06-09 02:02:05		AITA for not having a service for my husband because my mother wanted to dictate it?	"Hard core stuff here, a few years ago but still haunting me. 

My husband of 17 years took his own life. He was a non-believer, a self-described agnostic who hated organized religion of any kind. After the initial shock and heartbreak and cremation and visiting hours were over, it was time to plan a graveside service. His family is from out of state and attended the visitation at the funeral home, so my mother and I were to handle the planning. 

My family is very religious. I am not. My parents (dad is deceased) are Evangelical Christians. My mother assumed that a family friend pastor of theirs would be invited to conduct the service. I told her that my husband was a non-believer and would not want a Christian service that talked about Jesus and heaven. She got very upset with me and we argued about it for an hour. At one point she exclaimed, ""But what will I tell my family?!"" As if they aren't also my family. I told her that the service wasn't for her, it was for him and should be conducted in a way he would have wanted. We went round and round. In her view, he wasn't present to decide and we should do what was ""right"".

I had been through so much, I lost it. I don't quite remember what else I said, but for the first time in my life I screamed at her. I did finally say that if we could not have a service his way, there would be no graveside service at all. 

And there wasn't. 

His ashes were not buried, I have them in a wooden box at home. I retreated and spent several years working through my own grief.

I am still bothered by it. I could have planned something on my own, but the cemetery is three hours away and only family would have attended. So my entire family would stand disapprovingly through a secular service. His extended family, friends and co-workers all paid their respects at the funeral home. 

Was it better to honor his memory by refusing something he would have hated, or would it have been better to just do a Christian graveside service instead of nothing?"		1	0
byfdj7	2019-06-09 02:01:39	Agirlsthrowaway1234	AITA- For getting annoyed at my mother?	" I am 20 years old, can't move out atm

My mother hates me being independent. When I was 18 she would call me up telling me to come home. The reason? ""the street lights are on, it's going to be dark"" It was 6 pm and I was with a group of people. If I am cleaning my room she'll suddenly come in and start ""helping"". Going out?, she asks me where I am going, if I don't tell her or I'm vague she gets pissed, if I do she goes and searches up my exact travel route  then tries to explain it to me. When I was 18 but still in high school I decided to get McDonald for a treat. I was there for 10 minutes, she called me up asking where I was. I told her, she then said ""If I don't come straight home I have to call her and tell her"" I replied ""I would if I was going to be long"" she said ""Over 5 minutes you have to call""

 I was going on a trip, we are newish to the area and I had to take transport. On the transport things I saw something I wasn't familiar with (turns out they weren't important.) I knew the actual trip, the platforms I needed to be on,  I had my phone so I could easily check anyway. This is our conversation. 

**M (me) ""Hey mum, do you know what these mean? I thought they were acronyms for the stations or trains but they start with completely different letters""** H (her) ""Hold on.... Okay so first you get on this station here, and you need to go to platform 2"" (This did not answer anything it was basically just her looking up my trip) **M ""Oh sorry I don't need to know that, I already know, I was just wondering if you knew what they meant""** H (basically ignoring what I said) ""If you don't get that one you can get this one but you need to go on platform 1"" **M ""Yes I know that, I have my phone, I was just asking to see if you knew what these things are""** H (again ignoring)""Oh you can also get off at this station and change here"" **M ""I don't need to know that""** (I started getting a bit short here) H ""let me look up more travel"" **M ""No, don't**"" H ""No, no I'll help you"" **M ""I don't need help with that, I was just wondering if you knew what those things were""**H ""I don't know what they are....but if you get on at platform 5 here you can go travel to this platform""

(Imagine you were reading a book and had never seen a word, you ask someone what the word was and instead of just trying to help with that, they take the book from you, flip to the first page and start reading.)

Eventually I just got up and said ""Just don't worry about it, if you didn't know you should of just said""

Later she gives me the stations and platforms written down and says ""you need to use this, I wrote it down for you, so you have to take it"".  **M No I don't, I have my phone, I know the travel way, I just wanted to know if you knew what the acronyms were or if they were important. I can see the platforms and stations very clearly on my phone"".** She stormed off.

I thought the convo was over but  she went and told someone I was an ""ungrateful brat who didn't appreciate her help""

byfcuk	2019-06-09 01:59:35		AITAH for jumping to a conclusion effectively cancelling my plans with my SO?	"Calling her my SO is a stretch. We have feelings for each other and have made it very clear we just live pretty far from each other and seeing each other on a regular basis has proven difficult.

I’ve had to cancel our plans a few times. This is understandable to be upset at but today I was on my way to see her because we had plans to spend the night together. 

I was almost to her area when she texted me saying to forget about our plans. I assumed it’s because she had to work pretty early tomorrow morning or because she made plans. I hadn’t told her I was on my way yet but the plans were made a week ago and we’ve been talking about it since. After texting back if she was sure, I drove around for an hour and a half waiting for a response before driving back home. After getting home, she again texted doubling down by saying “just forget it”. 
I replied with “I already went home don’t worry” and “are you upset?”
I hadn’t even implied I was upset with her canceling, I didn’t want to make her feel like I might have been upset she had something come up and canceled. So I was very confused as to why she might be upset but the way she was texting was abnormal, so I asked. 

She replied with “you never came to begin with” and “no shit I’m upset”

It’s at this point I’m completely lost. The plans were set. And Idk what I did wrong. I was on my way like planned and she said forget it. Granted I never told her I was on my way. BUT the plans were made. At some point during our conversation I told her my day was tiring and that I was... well... tired. Apparently she took this as I’m not coming, but didn’t ask. So she just said don’t worry about it and to “just forget it”. She claims if she knew I was already on my way she wouldn’t have said that. She just wanted me to get rest. It’s clear miscommunication but now she is crying asking me to still come. I was bored and pretty lonely so I decided to have a few drinks and game after her canceling. I can’t drive which apparently also means I canceled again.

* 2000: My husband's parents separate. MIL was cheating and introduces the ""other"" man to my husband, then ten years old.
* 2001: MIL is diagnosed with cancer and gets back together with FIL. 
* 2014: MIL & FIL divorce again. Husband and I are living together. MIL moves in with us, but gets upset we're saving more money than her and refuses to pay rent. Husband asks her to leave. 
* 2015: MIL is diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Apologizes and begs to move back in. My husband says no unless she takes medication and can improve (thank god). MIL begins dating lots of men. They are actually quite nice and leave her once she has a bipolar episode.
* 2016: MIL has a relatively serious boyfriend and holds a Christmas without FIL. I catch on to the pattern that she doesn't want FIL to know she dates.
* 2017: The boyfriend leaves her. MIL starts making desperate passes at FIL at a birthday party she throws for him. Kisses him, tries to sleepover at his place. It is super uncomfortable. She keeps flirting with him but it doesn't work, so she's been dating since. 

I guess the better thing to do would be to be honest with MIL, but it doesn't seem worth it. She doesn't really bother keeping close ties with us. Once a year she gets lonely and wants to have dinner but it doesn't last long. Plus, we host Christmas now. 

My plan is just to go to events where FIL is, so I never have to meet MIL's boyfriends. That would mean my husband is meeting this guy on his own. I guess I just don't want to pretend to care about her or her boyfriends. And I'm tired of feigning interest when a sixty-year-old says things like ""I've met his parents, it's serious"" about a four-month relationship. I guess it's an asshole-ish thing to do. Or is it?"

I was interested in the job, mostly because in the interviews it sounded like it would be flexible and as long as I was getting my work done there wouldn’t be any problems. In the interview, he even said “we have a clock here, but it’s not for you.” 

My schedule is supposed to be 3 days outside of office where I am out marketing to businesses door to door. A big part of my job is taking notes about my experience and noting what I did for these days. The other 2 days are “admin days” where I do only computer work. I usually take my notes at the end of the day when I get home. This makes for roughly 10 hour days on these days. The other admin days, he wants me in office from 9 AM - 6 PM, even though I have voiced to him that I do not take lunch or breaks. Additionally, on these admin days, my work for the week is already done and he is just adding additional tasks that he comes up with out of the blue. I don’t feel like I should have to put in 48 hours over the week. Plus, apparently I am required to work 5 hours one Saturday per month, which was not mentioned in the interviews. These hours are not even accounting for the additional activities that are a defined part of my role, such as taking clients to dinners, attending events, etc. 

I tried to talk to him about this, and told him I was unhappy about being stuck in the office. I would much rather complete my work from home, and come into the office for meetings and inventory counts, as this was my expectation going into the job. He said perhaps in 6 months to a year we can revisit my spending more time doing work at home, but for now he needs me in office these days because he wants me to “learn more so I can get a license” (that we had not agreed upon my getting initially) and so “my coworkers will respect me.” In the office, I feel micromanaged and watched; there are cameras that record audio and video at every angle. I will not login to the WiFi on my laptop because apparently he is known for looking into peoples search history.

I am a great asset to his company and could help him grow a lot, demonstrated by the work I’ve already done, but I am not interested in continuing if I do not have freedom and cannot be happy. Accepting a low wage, (30K/year, no benefits until 1 year) in conjunction with the interview I had with him, made me think this would be a great job for a few years while I figure out who I am. 

But now, I am unhappy and prepared to quit. Am I being entitled? Am I the asshole?

Now, we're work friends and like to joke around with each other, but that shit stung. And on top of that my colleagues would be laughing at me for the rest of the week. I didn't have any witty remarks to make back, so I wait for a moment of silence before repeating what she said, except in her accent. She's Kenyan and has an African accent, so I exaggerated it a lot to sound like her, and added ""black people."" at the end, just like how she said white people.

Every one stopped laughing and looked really shocked. My colleague just laughed it off and went back to work, but everyone kept on giving me dirty looks throughout the day and didn't talk to me. Multiple people said some version of ""hey, that's not cool"", ""you're not funny"", or ""that was racist"", even though she was the one that made a joke about me first.

The next day I was told I was reported to HR by multiple people, and needed to come in for a discussion. The thing is SHE WASNT ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT REPORTED ME! That day, she literally apologized for her joke and we had no hard feeling between us, yet other people decided to get offended for her! She's the only African colleague we have, nobody else could've  been offended by the joke!

byf722	2019-06-09 01:40:57		AITA for saying I felt like this came with some strings attached.	"Parents had to mom grams into retirement home.  Decided to sell her house in the 55 and older community she was in.
       
 Parents came to me and said they are selling Grandmothers house and would buy another one of equal or lesser value and rent it to me.  I said ok.  Nice.
    

Parents look at houses .  I am somewhat involved but it's more there things. When I looked places in towns I liked it was not taken seriously.
  

 Dad drives up to some houses just being finished building . Same area as grandmothers house that they sold.
   

 Nice area but if had my choice, not where I would have made a purchass for myself as a long term.     But house is big upgrade from my other house I was renting.
   

So when me originally discuss rent dad asks me what i pay for my place. He said ok.  Pay that for this place, plus $200 for association.  Monthly rent is set at $1,015.00 plus utilities.  Below market rent too.  Should rent for $1,700.00. He then says I will not make any money off your rent.  What's left after taxes I will put in an account for you.  But if anything happens he says "" I will keep the money"". I say ok. Sounds good.
    
   
Now I have keept the place very nice.  They never had any problems with that.  To there credit they always respected my privacy and would never barge in or anything.  They live 15 min away. BTW
  
 I also own a home remodeling business. any  maintenance was taken care of.   I also did things such as installing nice 3/4"" hardwood floors in the whole first floor . Add ceiling fans, installed recessed lights in the upstairs. painted the whole place.  Didn't get to crazy  Cuz I never felt that I would buy it. But I knew that was always a possibility that I could purchase.
       

 The  issues that I had with the place was I felt at times it was held over my head as far as expectations for me too do things for them. It had some strings attached.  
He started to get mad because I didn't take him out enough and treat for dinner.  When we would go out I normally would pay for my own.  Sometimes he would pay and I pay tip. Most times I would pay for the whole meal, when I  would invite out and pick the place. 

And  whenever there would be an argument about something, (and it was never an argument  to do with the actual house).  He would say things like "" you know after all we're doing for you and you you're going to act like this.""  ""Whose parents do this for there kids""  ""I worry about you being entitled"".  ""I'm not doing this for your brother""   
 It just got old.  And I kinda knew prior something like this would happen.

 We got into an argument once and the next time I saw him he was saying he was gonna start taking the money he puts in seperste account from rent and keep to him self.  Happend twice.  He never actually did it."	Not enough info	1	0

This sudden transition has been understandably difficult for her, but for the most part she’s been a good sport about her new diet. I’ve been really good about supporting her, too, constantly searching for new gluten free recipes and restaurants to help make things easier. Recently, however, we got in a huge fight while we were out to eat. The server dropped off a basket of fresh, steaming pita bread and I instinctively took a bite. She got really upset because “not being able to eat pita is the saddest part about this.” She then claimed that she’s totally okay with me eating other gluten products in front of her, but pita is a no-go bc she misses it most of all. 

I followed that up by taking the largest bite of all.

We had a lot of things in common, from anime, to music, sports and videogames. He didn't seem to be obsessed with anime girls until recently. I keep hearing how ""X is cute"", ""Y so sweet"", anime girls are life, top of the world and 2D > 3D. To be honest, I thought (hoped?!) he is meme-ing around, but this started to affect me a lot. I didn't watch anime anymore, I somehow felt like I'm a bit too old for it (25) and I didn't have that much time  anyway. I've also started disliking it because of his obsession with anime girls.

&#x200B;

Now, I thought I might be just overthinking it, because hey, we all like someone - let's say I really have a passion for Cpt. America and I think he is handsome. I thought that I am the problem and I tried my best to change, to be more understanding and become more attractive for him. I started working in gaming industry, I went to gym a bit more, I tried my best to think of ways to become more awesome in his eyes. A thing that is worth mentioning is that I have never questioned his hobbies / kinks / whatever. I have always been open and if his new hobby was building a car from 0, I was the one searching for parts on google. Also searching for anime girls stickers for that car. 

&#x200B;

Recently I've been a bit tired from overworking and I couldn't resist anymore to hear how anime girls are the best thing ever. I've told him that I need attention too and he should chill with the anime girls, because I am jealous. I realize how stupid it sounds, but think about trying your best every day, being tired from work and having a person that tells you that a character from anime is cute, while you get 0 nice words. 

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for telling him that I'm jealous and he should chill with that? I felt disrespected, not appreciated and ignored for so long and I had to bring this up.

&#x200B;

He said I have something against ""his hobby"", but I would say it's more like a fetish. So, I don't know - should I be mad at myself for not respecting ""his hobby""? Not that it matters anymore, since we broke up because I was jealous, but I'd least like to apologize if I was rude towards him."	Not the A-hole	0	0

It will include his house and I suspect a small RRSP. He is very traditional and has probably left me the house but I don't know for sure. He is still living.

I plan to, if at all possible, cut my sister out of this will after my father passes.

She is and has been for most of my life an unreasonable asshole to me and my parents. She has a super short temper, tries to control everyone around her and is wildly unpleasant to be around. The only reason I am able to maintain any sort of relationship with her is because I keep my distance.

I hate how she treated my mother and treats my father. However they loved and love her, and wouldn't want me to do this. It will probably end our relationship forever.

I encourage my father to take trips and spent his money, maybe sell his house and move somewhere smaller. I don't particularly need the house or money and it's not a large estate.

byexjt	2019-06-09 01:11:34		AITA For Being Ungrateful for My Parent's Birthday Gift?	"Hi all. Looking for a little guidance and judgment here.

I (30f) come from a family that is pretty big on gift giving and cards and celebrations and all that. Even my husband's side of the family is that way, and I am grateful for it. I also live 1500 miles across the country from nearly all of my relatives (including parents and sister). Admittedly, I am a very forgetful person and sometimes my gifts and cards arrive a little late, but I always send something. And it is always something that I put a lot of time and thought into. I want my gifts to mean something to the recipient and for them to know that I care about them. 

Additionally, my mom is a pretty controlling and narcissistic person. So when it comes to special events, like family birthdays and holidays, I am expected to send cards, gifts, and then be available to FaceTime with the family for the occasion. Failing to do these things always results in her disappoint and guilt tripping. 

Anyway, when I went to college, my dad added me to their AAA membership. It was very nice of them and has come in handy a couple of times. It renews and they are charged every year around my birthday. For the past three years or so, for my birthday, I have received a card from them with my new AAA card inside. This was fine, if not a little frustrating. I am essentially getting their renewed AAA membership for my birthday. 

Last June, I turned 30 years old, and my in-laws had us over for a beautiful dinner in celebration and gave me a couple of very nice presents. My husband and I then celebrated with our friends. A few of days later, the mail comes and my parent's card is included. I guess maybe I was hoping for something different, but again, it was just the card and the renewed AAA membership. I'm not gonna lie, I was very upset. After the genuine effort that my in-laws and friends put in to make me feel appreciated on my birthday, this felt impersonal and completely devoid of thought. 

I've never said anything to them before because of the aforementioned mother. She is very quick to accuse you of being ungrateful and self-absorbed, and I am not sure how to approach it without her blowing up. I am now approaching my 31st birthday and expecting the same thing again. Should I say something? WIBTA for saying something? AITA for being selfish and ungrateful? I realize many people get nothing from their parents for their birthdays and I should probably be happy to get this at all. It just feels very unbalanced from my perspective."		1	0

As he was finishing his transaction and everyone else was getting drinks, he put his credit card into the chip reader. I tapped him on the shoulder and asked, ""May I please borrow your card?"" He laughed derisively and looked at me funny and said no. I clarified that I meant the discount card, not the credit card, and was met with another derisive laugh as he took his card out and walked away.

I held up my card to the cashier and told her that I had the card, I was just testing him to see if he would let me borrow it. I figured it would be harmless, since it literally costs him nothing to let me use it. Given his reaction, though, I might have been out of line.

About 5 months ago SO and I took in her sister, thinking that we were helping a 20, soon to be 21-year-old get on her feet. It's kinda your basic Cinderella story - mom divorces dad, step-dad is a less than upstanding citizen (think mental and emotional abuse).

Turns out, we're doing no such thing. We're basically giving her free room and board right now. All she does all day is either sit in her room or the living room in our apartment, eating our food, using our dishes, and basically...doing nothing with her life. Any time she's confronted with the fact that she's going nowhere, or the fact that she's not doing anything, she gets upset and starts crying. She gets a stipend from her mother - $120/month - that she uses for whatever she wants to spend it on. She has no idea the value of money because she's never had a job, she never finished high school, doesn't have a GED, isn't looking for a job, and spends all day on pinterest, looking at wedding dresses and other teenage girl type stuff, and occasionally 'studying'. In the five months she's been living with us, she hasn't accomplished anything but take 1 of 4 GED test portions and after three months of us nagging her to do it, and see a therapist to help her get over the crap her step-dad put her through.

Tonight, she decided to go out to eat - which I'm cool with - it's her money, but at the same time, she should be spending it on other things - like updating her wardrobe, getting herself some furniture, study materials, self-improvement, her own food, anything to help her become self-sufficient. I'm getting frustrated with her lack of...anything - no ambition, no desire for self-improvement, nothing. We want to help her become self-sufficient including understanding the importance and value of money and don't think that she will understand that until she has to start spending it on things that she has to spend it on rather than things she wants. My SO and I don't want to start having kids until she's gone (and we're at a point in our lives where we kinda want kids soon) because we don't want her anywhere around any kid we have. She's too immature and irresponsible.

So, what we want to do, is start charging her a percentage of her 'income' as rent to help her realize that life isn't all sunshine and daisies, that sometimes your money has to go to things that you don't want it to (like rent, bills, insurance, etc) to help her realize and learn the value of money. I'm not wanting to take a ridiculous amount or anything unreasonable. Right now, the number we're thinking of is only $20 - leaving her with $100 to do whatever she wants with. We don't need the money - I've got a job that pays enough for all our needs plus hers. But we're tired of her doing nothing with her life and not learning how the world works.

byeuhd	2019-06-09 01:02:29	Rerollercoaster	WIBTA if I take a better salaried position, if that leaves my friend/colleage worse off?	"I'm a family doctor/general practitioner. I've been sick with a long-term illness and I'm just returning to practice. I work part-time right now at a clinic owned by a colleague of mine. I don't have my own panel of patients, I just see the ""overflow"" of patients that are ""attached"" to her, but can't get into her because she's overbooked.

For myself, I'm not actually overbooked, I'm often underbooked. Largely this is because I don't have my own panel. Some days there's enough patients to just barely fill the hours I book to be at clinic (say 4/hour, which is really quite light), some days there's large gaps. Since I'm paid per-patient, that means that some days I make average money, some days I make very little. I have loans and a mortgage to pay, and am stressing over my lowered income.

My friend/colleague, the owner, is a lovely person. She's enthusiastic and excited and has been very kind to let me take on this kind of position, which reduces my responsibilities in terms of long-term follow up (in case I get sick again). Not everyone would allow this, as she takes the majority of liability. She has suggested several times that she would like to add more patients to her own panel as long as she can keep me as an associate to see overflow. She would remain the ""most responsible physician (MRP),"" basically the place where the buck stops. (The natural consequences of adding more patients would be that the amount of overflow would increase, thus filling my hours and making me more productive financially for the clinic and for myself).

I'm really hesitant about that proposal and have expressed this in terms of gentle refusal to my friend. If I become significantly ill again and have to leave practice, she would be left in the lurch. My illness is not terminal, but has a waxing and waning course of severity.

Here's the AITA: I have had a first interview with a telemedicine company, and am slated to have a second, final interview. I think it is likely I will get this position. There will be some small health benefits, flexibility, no MRP responsibility, and an easy readiness to step away for illness/leave. It will strongly limit some of the draining interactions and heavy paperwork that can come with in-person clinics. In addition, it pays a salary per hour, instead of being paid per-patient. This is critical for me; it improves and stabilizes my income significantly. There is also no volume requirement - that is, I don't HAVE to see a certain number of patients an hour to make that salary. 

If I take the telemedicine position, I would probably reduce my hours at my colleague's clinic. I don't think I have the energy or capacity to do both at this time. 

WIBTA if I committed to more time with this telemedicine position for its stability? If I take the telemedicine position, how should I tell my colleague? I feel like I'm betraying her."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"So my relationship has been kind of stressful with my boyfriend recently. There was some conflicts and fighting about a variety of things over about the course of a week. We’re a college couple, he’s going to be graduating in a semester. At the end of the week my boyfriend tells me a big reason he’s been so on edge recently is because he’s stressed about the new level of commitment and obligation he isn’t sure he’s ready for since we’re getting a place together. We talk it out and everything seems okay for now.

I go visit my family while in town for work, and I separately talk to my mom and her boyfriend about the situation I’ve been having with my boyfriend. That I really wish he’s just talk stuff out with me instead of becoming all passive aggressive, and that I’d like him to not be so insecure about these types of things. They understand our situation, so they give me some advice(“give him compliments more often, men often need more validation from their significant other than they’d like to admit”, “there’s this book I think was written before you were born, it really explains the communications differences between men and women, you guys should read it, it helped me be more open about what was bothering me”).

I go home and tell my boyfriend about the advice they gave me to see what they thought of it. And oh does it get bad FAST.

He starts calling me a snitch, saying I can’t keep my mouth shut about our problems. He says he hates people like me, people that just feel the need to tell people about his business. I point out that it’s not HIS business, it’s OUR business. He then says that if I HAVE to talk about the stuff going on between us with my parents, to generalize, talk about a problem I’m having with “someone” rather than a problem I’m having with “him”. I proceed to point out that they would figure out immoderately that I was talking about him. “You don’t know that” he replied.

I tell him exactly what I told them, and he starts saying how my parents will now start to seeing him as an insecure abusive boyfriend, when HE tells his parents nothing but good things about me. He says what I told them made me entirely look like the victim even though everything he got mad about was my fault, that I’ve been a terrible girlfriend. Me not initiating sex, me being on my phone too much, me playing too much video games and I’m a klutz. With those, yeah, I’m in the wrong, and I’ve been making a conscious effort to do better. But then he adds on me spilling his business to my family. And if I HAVE to talk to my family again about the problems we have, I have to preface about all the ways I screw it up(mentioned previously) and that I’m the main reason we fight. So in the end, it was my fault and I agreed to his terms.

"My girlfriend leaves out of town Sunday morning to another state for a work conference. I was going to borrow her car for those two days since my car was in the shop getting fixed till Monday. Today her parents angrily called her demanding I not drive her car because even though she pays for the insurance, and she pays for the full car payment (and has always paid for the payment, she was not old enough in high school to directly take out a loan for the car but she paid her parents money to pay for it by proxy) . Their reasoning was since the title is in their name since they “purchased” it for her in high school, I should not be driving it. I put purchased in quotations because all they did was sign a paper for a loan, and my girlfriend paid them via her part time job when she was 17, so they have put ZERO physical money towards this car, all it has is their name on the title. 

My girlfriend and I feel it should be her choice whether or not I borrow it since it will only be for two days, but her parents have made this into a point of contention and told her very explicitly not for me to drive it.

byerwa	2019-06-09 00:54:56	Graynesz	AITA for feeling disrespected because my dad smoked in my car	"So, for backstory, I'm 19 years old and I got my license about a month ago, because I couldnt get it sooner for medical reasons (I'm perfectly able to drive safely daily, dont worry).

More backstory. Me, my dad, and my stepmom have only had 1 car to drive for quite a while, until sometime last year when my stepmom got my aunts old car. So then we had 2, and the one that we had was my dads. Then, my dad got a new truck last December, so the car that was once the only car we had has been collecting dust until I got my license a month ago. 

(Important info) Well, before I started driving it, we needed to renew the registration and all that. So my dad and I went, and we didnt change it to be under my name... we kept it under my step moms name. Why? Because I didnt push enough to get it under my name, plus my dad didnt want to stay at the secretary of state forever (idk I guess we dont have DMV's in my part of michigan). I also paid $100.00 for the registration, btw.

So earlier, my dad and I went to get new rotors because when I break, it's really bumpy and just not smooth. Idk, I'm not a car person. Obviously, I paid for everything, spent over $150.00.

My dad KNOWS I hate it when he smokes in the car. I ALWAYS have, not only because of the smell, but because I have asthma, but the smell too because it's in the car that I drive everyday. He says I'm being ridiculous when I cover my face and that I only hate the smell - he doesnt think it affects my breathing. Well, second hand smoke DOES affect my breathing, and I cover my face if I cant get away from it. Before, when they would drive me places because I didnt have my license - If my parents were really stressed in the car, I dont care about it that much, it helps them cope or w.e, but I still cover my face. So I ask him ""are you seriously smoking in my car right now?"" And he tells me ""YOUR car? Did you sign for it?"" 

That really put things into perspective for me. I need to drive to get to work, and.. I really think these are intrusive thoughts right now, but my parents could just screw me over whenever they want. Despite trying to buy parts for the car that I drive to fix it (with the help of my dad), I'm spending money on a car that isnt even under my name when it should be. I try to do things for myself, but they're very thoughtful (or so I think) and like to help me with everything new that I do, and I appreciate it. I would never think in a million years that they would be the type of people to screw me over in a way that I could literally be carless, jobless, and homeless. I strongly think that I'm just having intrusive thoughts, but it's also very real and could happen..

I may have missed a few details here and there, but I tried to make is as clear as possible for readers.

byertm	2019-06-09 00:54:40	GammaBreak	AITA for requesting a (temporary) refund from an artist I hired after a ~4 month project is being delayed to over a year?	"I wrote a comic script last year that I wanted to see come to fruition. I had an acquaintance/contact look over my script, and they liked it, and referred me to an artist they knew and worked with several times. This artist did not speak English very well, so my contact volunteered to sort of bridge the gap (they were in the same country).

I had made it clear initially that while I didn't have a set deadline, I wanted to have it move at a reasonable and consistent pace. The artist quoted that he could get it done in 4 months, which my contact thought was a bit tight, so I assured them that there was some flexibility to that. We agreed that I'd pay half for the initial sketchwork of each page in a batch, review and approve the pages, then pay the other half for the completed pages. Repeat per each batch.

So work got underway the last few days of January after my initial payment for batch 1. The first batch of images was delivered the first week of April. So already, a bit slower than initially expected, as the first batch wasn't even a quarter of the full comic, but like I said, so long as it keeps moving, I was flexible, and the pages were coming out great. Finished full payment for batch 1, and I paid for the half of batch 2 about a day or 2 later. This would have been the second week of April.

Shortly after, my contact informed me that the artist had a stress injury. Nothing major, he just needed to take a break from drawing for about a week, and mine wasn't the only project he was working on. Not a problem.

2 weeks later, now entering May, my contact informed me that due to a deadline, the artist couldn't work on my project until June, but once he finished his current project, the entire month of June would be dedicated to mine. No one would be pleased to hear a delay, but again, it was only a little under a month, and with no set deadline, I didn't really mind it.

Today, a little over a week into June, my contact notified me that due to other projects, the artist was completely shelving my script for at least the next 4 months (citing October; not a specific day, just the general month). My contact admitted that they did not know anything about this, and if they had, they would have warned me about these sorts of delays.

And to be honest, had I known it was going to take more than an entire year to do the comic when the artist initially quoted me 4 months, I would have definitely considered another artist. So I asked that my last payment for batch 2 ($250 USD) be refunded, and that when the artist was ready to start again, I would pay him the amount back. He literally has not started a single sketch from the second batch in over a month, despite having been paid for 2 months.

In part, I asked for the refund because of something my contact told me after notifying me. They said something to the effect of ""delays are very common with artists"", so I took this to also mean ""it's likely going to be later than October""."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"a couple months ago me (f 20) and my bf (m21) of three years, began planning a trip to Florida with some of our closest friends who are couples. Everything was good, until my bf (who is living with his mom while finishing uni) told his mom about it and she told him he couldnt go. Now we both know how overbearing she is but we didnt expect her to object and to try to guilt him out of it. She started to complain about how it made her nervous and uncomfortable to think of him going somewhere with me and away from her. We've already bought the tickets and booked the hotel and when he told her this she said she would compensate him. He is 21 years old, helps with the bills, and goes to work and school full time, HE DESERVES THIS TRIP. I am seriously getting tired of her guilting him for doing things without her!! she has her own life, travels to europe for two weeks at a time frequently, WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM GOING TO FLORIDA? anyway, HES ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT BAILING ON THE TRIP and this made me feel so sad, angry, and betrayed. How am i supposed to go on this couples trip without him? it hurt me so much that he couldn't stand up to his mom, for the sake of the trip we have been saving up for. We started arguing because i called his mom manipulative, unfair, ugly, and selfish for always keeping him away from what he wants for himself, for the sake of herself. he went on to call me heartless and said that i wouldnt understand bc my mom isnt with me bc she's dead. this really hurt me. i know what its like to have a strict parent and its way different from a toxic one

i made him leave and in my anger and sadness i texted his mother confessing to her the resentment i have towards her for never supporting her son and for always being a selfish manipulative mother. i also told her how unfair it was for her to treat me like a stranger, i scolded her for all the shitty things she has said to my bf who is always so respectful and obedient to her, i called her out for going on all these trips all over europe, never taking him, then getting mad at him for planning his own... i went off on her and my bf was not happy about it

His mom isnt confrontational so she never replied. my bf called me and was talking about how ridiculous i am and about how upset his mom is and how he gets that i trying to defend him but i overstepped, i told him that i dont feel bad about doing it and that i dont care if shes upset and that she deserves it, thats when he blew up and called me an asshole and a cold hearted bitch. hes never talked to me like that before, we get along really well and this was the first time hes called me anything like that. after the call, i told my friend about it and she said that she understood why i was so upset but that i was being too harsh his mom ruined my trip but i shouldve let him handle it, instead of soiling the small relationship i do have with his mom. part of me thinks shes right...

byeq7q	2019-06-09 00:49:52	agentlithium	AITA for getting mad at my friends?	"My friends have been together for a year now. We went to school together and I was the one who set them up. One of them goes to uni in another province and when she comes home, we all hang out together. In the last few months, however, the atmosphere has been noticeably different to me. When we're together, it's like I'm not even there. I have to carry every conversation. If we watch a movie, they whisper and giggle among themselves the whole time. When I hang out with either of them alone, they just text the other one.

I mentioned to them before that I was feeling like I was inserting myself in the middle of their relationship. I encouraged them to spend time alone together more, but they both insisted that they wanted to hang with me. This lead to them inviting me into situations I really should not have been in (i.e. my friend's last night in town ended in a dead-silent night drive with her GF weeping in the car. I've done the LDR thing myself for a lot longer and farther so I know what that feels like, but I've never put a friend in that position) Basically, I feel intrusive whenever I'm with them and it's uncomfortable, but they continue to invite me out.

They invited me out one day and I didn't say a word unless prompted. It was a stupid way to handle things, I admit, but they hardly spoke the whole time, let alone to me. I ended up sending one of them a very bluntly worded text afterward. Now, I hate conflict, but I felt like they were only inviting me places out of pity and, although inadvertently, it was bringing me down. I felt unwanted. I'd rather just stay home so they could have fun together.

My friend went OFF on me. She called out everything I've ever done, things that had nothing to do with this. I roast her for the music she listens to sometimes and she brought that up like I was attacking her when she roasts me just the same. She read me for not trying to insert myself into the situation more and how she and her GF were trying, but it was my fault that they couldn't make me feel welcome. She even capped it off with an ""I'm sorry YOU feel that way.""

I pussied out immediately. I frantically apologized for being childish and wanting attention and took everything I said back. She maintained I was out of line but accepted my apology. She invited me on another drive a short while ago and we had a laugh, but again, I was the one keeping the conversation going.

My best friend was mad that I didn't stand my ground because she thinks I should have called them out. Better to be happy than win an argument, but the offensive response and the ass-backwards 'apology' I received still doesn't really sit right with me. I acknowledge I was being petty and I shouldn't have brought it up at all, but I just don't like how quick she was to absolve herself of any wrongdoing and turn everything on me.

Am I totally in the wrong here? I'm still scared that I cost myself two of my closest friends over nothing."	No A-holes here	0	0

Near the end of college I started going to a Protestant student church with some of my friends (who I actually met in the College Democrats, it was a liberal church though) and go to a non-denominational church now. My mom doesn't seem to understand that I'm not Catholic, she seems to think I still identify as that fundamentally but just go to a different church because I'm mad about their position on LGBT rights or female priests, but I still HAVE to be Catholic deep down because ""everyone brought up Catholic is that way."" It makes zero sense to me but has hardly impacted my life.

A few months ago her and some friends were in my city visiting and she asked if I wanted to come to dinner with her. I agreed and met them at the restaurant. It was a Friday and during Lent. My mom ordered fish and vegetables sides, when it came my turn to order I ordered a burger. My mom kind of looked at me and said ""fish sandwich? It's Friday..."" I just brushed her off and told the waitress no, I was getting the burger.

My mom seemed shocked and upset. She never brought it up there or later but I realize she was assuming I was still following Catholic dietary rules during Lent even if my church doesn't require them. At least it was something she could pretend was the case, I blew that wide open.

byep92	2019-06-09 00:46:48	Kurnath	WIBTA if I gave an anonymous tip to the police over my marijuana-smoking neighbor?	"Let me start by saying that I really don't care if people smoke weed. Even if its illegal, people can do it all they want. That being said, there are some issues I am having with my next-door neighbor in my apartment complex.

&#x200B;

These are the reasons why I am considering reporting them to the police:

* The smell of marijuana is very badly seeping over into my apartment, whether the windows are open or not. The bottom floor reeks of the stuff and I can smell it on the second floor as well. You can even smell it outside, in fact.
* I have some pre-existing lung problems. The fumes are bad enough that it is actually causing my chronic lung pain to reemerge, which I thought I had finally gotten over.
* My landlord is aware of the problem but has not acted despite the neighbor 2 doors down complaining as well. My neighbor only smokes in the evenings after the landlord office is closed, so I can't ask them to show up then either. Marijuana is illegal where I live and my neighbor is obviously violating their lease agreement as well. My landlord has supposedly warned them so I don't think me asking them to tone it down would be effective.

So, WIBTA if I gave an anonymous tip to law enforcement over this? I hate to be a stick-in-the-mud over marijuana but the smell is quite repulsive. Honestly, I am slightly concerned about retaliation as well."	Not the A-hole	0	0

"I (late twenties M) was at the rooftop terrace at my condo building today enjoying a rare sunny day which I haven’t experienced in a while. There were a group of friends bbqing, another group of gals (early twenties) with a dog chatting on a bench, and old creepy dude who kept periodically stripping starting with his shirt, under shirt and finally his jeans until he was wearing nothing but his briefs. It definitely creeped me the fuck out but wasn’t enough to get me to leave. I had my headphones on and was sunbathing on a lounger when I heard loud barking that startled me. 

That was my cue to  leave. I got up and one of the ladies from the dog group asked me if I minded if she took the leash off the dog. I said “not at all, as long as it makes him happy and quiet”. I was already leaving anyway so I didn’t care. I got up, got dressed and was heading to the exit when the dog started approaching me. I had a shitty incident with a neighbor’s dog once which made me terrified of dogs. I glared at the dog in the eyes which caused him to suddenly jump back and start barking. The owner (I’m guessing) ran towards me and said “he’s very friendly, he’s still a baby so he’s easily spooked”. I snapped back at her “he’s also super fuckin’ loud”. Her face turned bright red and I could feel everyone giving me dirty looks. One of the girls from the bbq group approached the dog, knelt and asked if she could pet him. I took my things and headed out with an eerie silence behind me. 

I’m feeling kinda awkward about it, I feel like I might’ve embarrassed her in front of her friends when she was just trying to be friendly. AITA?"		1	0

When we entered, the pub was rather full with few seats, although there was an empty seat available at the bar. I sat down and my friend pulled a seat up. 

Around 5 minutes after sitting and talking, a gentleman approached me, physically grabbed my arm and moved it and picked up a drink and a tin that was beside my arm on the arm. I asked was everything okay, since he physically grabbed my arm and apologised believing I may have accidentally nudged him. He then turns to the barmaid and states 'I guess I can't even go to the toilet without having my seat stolen'. 

The barmaid then awkwardly smiles at me to which I turn to the gentlemen and say words to the effect of 'I hadn't realised you were sat here, would you like your seat back, I don't mind moving'. He says no, its fine, he will be leaving soon. I turn around and speak to my friend and not two minutes later he says 'are you not going to move then?' and at this point I say, no, I asked if you'd like me to move and you said you were leaving, you were very rude and physically grabbed my arm and had you been polite in the first instance I would have done but your attitude has been foul.

(If this breaches any rules, I am sorry personally, I don't think he is the asshole in this situation, but he genuinely feels bad, and thinks i'm not exactly impartial, as he's my best bud)

Anways, with that out of the way, i'll write the rest of this in first person to make it easier to follow.

&#x200B;

I play an MMO called Final Fantasy with my friends, we have an FC ( Free company, kind of like a guild in other games)  we raid and generally we are all close, we even met up quite recently. At the time of all this happening I was with this girl.

&#x200B;

Everything was going alright for a while.  Until she had a disagreement with my FC leader

&#x200B;

Eventually she didn't feel so comfortable in the FC and left.

then we started having a few communication issues, and broke up. I was absolute crushed and i vented to my raid team and they supported me through it, during the break up, she did a few things that hurt me, and i vented about them too. So really my raid team only got the worst of our relationship.

The raid leader, made me promise, that i'd not get back with her, and if i did start talking to her, i was to tell him immediately.

over time, a mutual friend of ours spotted we were miserable without each other. She decided to play matchmaker and bonk our heads together and we quickly realised what we were missing.

&#x200B;

We had grown so much during the time apart and realised how important we were to each other, we became more devoted and in tune with each other, vowing to listen and talk about our problems more, being honest.

I didn't tell my raid leader right away, i wanted to give my girlfriend time to prove she had changed, and to just enjoy being with her again before having to explain it.

&#x200B;

As i was preparing to explain it, the raid leader became irate at me one day, apparently my friends ex, had been shit talking him to the Raid leader, and now the Raid leader was all up in my face for being friends with such a 'lowlife'

This really put me off telling him, scared that he'd react the same way with my girlfriend

&#x200B;

This put it off for a while, but after a few weeks of seeing my therapist, and building up confidence, i finally had the courage to tell him.

&#x200B;

He EXPLODED at me for 'lying' to him and 'betraying' him and his trust, telling me how little tolerance he has for liars, he started a vote going in the FC discord if i should be kicked for the outrageous crime of being with someone i love.

&#x200B;

His girlfriend, someone who had previously been nice to me, private messaged me, telling me 'You are a vile person'

As soon as we get the chickens, we get into the car. Less than 2 seconds later one of my siblings starts eating the chicken and I get angry for two reasons. The first is that my sibling might eat the whole chicken. The second, is that there is no trash bin in my car and if my sibling finished eating the chicken, where will the bones be discarded? I don't want the bones to be thrown into the bag where the rest of the uneaten chicken is because that is disgusting. So I asked where the chicken would be discarded. The response is in the bag.

My roommate is super religious. Like, holy shit religious. Which is fine, everyone has their thing. But she’s asked me to not have sex in the apartment even if she isn’t here. 

I understand her not wanting me doing the coitus if she’s here because god knows I don’t want to be doing that shit with anyone around. But when she’s not there? That’s a bit excessive to me. So I’ve been ignoring that. 

The other day she came home while me and my SO were bumping uglies and left a package by my door. I’m not sure if she heard or not but I’ve been avoiding her ever since.

I’m feeling like a massive asshole right now. (Also this isn’t her only “rule” for the apartment that I pay to live in)."	Not the A-hole	1	0

byebob	2019-06-09 00:06:51	GrinoSuave	AITA for refusing to let my family continue to borrow money from me?	"So I just got a text from my mom asking to borrow $300 for a couple of weeks. I usually get these types of text messages from her and my sister once a month. I have already let my mother borrow $100 from the last month, that I haven't gotten back yet. Usually, she pays me back sooner than this, since this is the longest she has gone without paying me back, but I'm getting irritated that they keep asking me for money for the past couple of years now.

&#x200B;

I have cut my sister off of giving her money since I found out she ""borrowed"" money from me to get my mom's car out of the pound (because my sister was driving the car on a suspended license and got in a fender bender). She kept saying she didn't have money, so I paid the pound fee of $400 so my mother can have a car. As soon as I paid that fee, my sister, who is 36 years old now, bought a plane ticket to Dallas and got a hotel to go to some get-rich-quick pyramid scheme convention. She asks me for money still and even asks for my credit for a car and a home, but I refused to help her since the Dallas scheme she pulled.

&#x200B;

My mom is not a bad person, and I love her dearly, but I hit a point where enough is enough. When I took her out for mothers day, she was telling me my sister, who she and her daughter lives with our mother, does not help pay any bills in the home and does not help pay for the rent. This irked me a lot, as now I'm seeing that I'm giving money because my sister is not helping my mother at all. Now my brother moved into their home from another state, and he has been responsible so far with helping and just got a job and will get paid in 3 weeks.

&#x200B;

I have the money to help, but I feel like now I'm in a situation where they need to start helping themselves without my assistance. As this is usually when they talk to me, they never conversate with me at any other times; just when they need my help

My brother who is almost 25 and our mutual, lifelong, childhood friend who is male and also 25 have had a sort of relationship since they were in their early teens. Although, outside of the 'relationship' they have together they have both had both long and short term girlfriends. When they're together and any time they meet, they are affectionate towards each other hold hands and behave in a manner (in front of everyone) that would indicate that they are in a relationship. They then both never comment on it or act like it even happens. I met with them both last week and they, who are both in relationships currently, were sharing a hotel room and behaving like they usually do. I casually asked my brother what their relationship is to each other and if he is bisexual. He blew up at me and was incredibly angry.

bye95p	2019-06-08 23:59:12	gobbluth45	AITA for not giving a single mother a refund	"Throwaway account. I’m a videographer in the entertainment industry working mainly with semi famous rappers on music videos and live shows. The people I work with for the most part aren’t rich but do well enough so they can afford rent and have some disposable income. I also have some clients who are flat broke and save for months just to hire me. 

This one rapper, a single mother who is gaining a following hired and paid me $500 to shoot a show. I had her sign a contract which clearly states my refund policy (must give a 72 hour notice for a full refund, 2 days for half refund and less than 48 hours is no refund and you must pay the entire amount agreed upon if not already paid upfront. This applies for any reason) 

This woman canceled on me the day of the show because something was wrong with the venue (I called and verified, they had an electrical problem).  She told me she wanted her money back. I was sympathetic and told her I wouldn’t refund her because I could have booked another event that day but I can give her a discount on the next show. 

She flipped out. Basically said “fuck the contract” and that I need to have sympathy and think of her child and that she could possibly be getting evicted from her apartment and has been eating ramen noodles for a month.  

Now I hate being guilt tripped. She signed the contract, knew what she was getting into and knew my refund policy. I don’t think I should have to forfeit $500 for the sake of a child that I have nothing to do with because of something that is not my fault. 

Now she’s saying she’s gonna take me to court (she won’t even have the time to try filing the suit) Her friends are spamming my Instagram with angry comments and I’ve even gotten some threats of violence. 2 other potential clients said they’re not gonna hire me anymore because I won’t sympathize with a single mother.  

I have lots of other people supporting me in this situation and I know it’s gonna blow over so I’m not worried. But AITA? If I am, I’ll change my refund policy going forward but I’m honoring this contract. 

TLDR: Single mother client cancelled on me. I won’t refund her because of my policy that she agreed to and now I’m getting hate on social media."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bye7v6	2019-06-08 23:55:09	MidLaneMusic	AITA for being mad at my friend for missing my bands first show?	"Backstory you need: I moved to Portland about a year ago specifically to achieve more in the music world. A few months ago I joined a fantastic band as their lead guitar, and only a month after joining we lined up our debut gig. I met my friend through the job I have and she has become one of my closest friends out here in Portland. We relate a lot on stuff like artistic careers and enjoying other people's creativity. 

A few nights ago the band and I did our show and it was incredible. It was my first live show with a full band and we killed it. Got an encore and a few more gigs set up right afterwards. The downside was only 15 minutes after the show the open mic starts up, which I have performed in and enjoy but I've already left. Every other band member had gone to their respective friends and family that came, and I did have one good friend come but he works mornings so he left right before me. Any band mate would've been fine with me joining them at their table but I don't like intruding so I left with a few tears. 

So to the whole point being my friend, she had known for 2 months what the date of my show was and where, and we had talked a whole lot at work about how excited I was for it and how much it meant to me as a debut show. Cut to the day of, she lets me know she has class and can't make it. Knowing her this was valid so I don't think she's lying to me, but I'm very mad she didn't realize this months ago. A big part of my selfish excitement of the show was her seeing how good I am at guitar and being able to hang out with her outside of work. 

I worked with her this afternoon only for an hour and normally I love talking to her, and she was clearly excited to talk about the show, but I felt so angry towards her and I still can't fully grasp why. So AITA for being mad at her 3 days after she couldn't make it to my show?"	Asshole	0	0

I have a very difficult relationship with my mother. She’s bipolar and very emotionally manipulative. She does take her meds and such, but she is just extremely self centered and very unstable.

About two years ago, my 20 year old cousin ran away from home. He came back after months being gone. His parents and my family were relief that he came back alive.

The reason why he ran from home was because he felt pressure to go to college and work after finishing high school. I understand if he want to take a gap year and take time to do something he wants to do. Totally understandable. BUT what he did instead was stay in his room and didn’t leave the house for almost a year. 

I saw his parents were struggling financially but they were afraid to tell him to get a job because they though it might trigger him to running from home again. After hearing that I took my cousin out for dinner. During dinner I discuss with him it has any future plan or ambition he want to achieve. He said no and ignored me the whole dinner. This was where I had enough, I told him in a serious tone “What the hell do you want to with your life? Sleep and eat? You aren’t rich. You aren’t a kid anymore. You parents are struggling right now. Don’t you want to help even a little bit? At least work part time to help your parent out even if a little bit” He stayed quiet. After that we finish dinner and when home. 

Few days later I was told by my aunt to mind my own business. Because I am stressing out her son aka my cousin. Then my grandma pitch in saying to leave my cousin alone."		1	0

I drove her there since we were going shopping after. While we’re waiting for our drinks, she shows me a picture of the pink mohawk guy with his boyfriends and their husbands. She called them a whores. Said they should just break up since they obviously have trust issues and can’t handle being in a committed relationship. 

I was appalled. We’re been friends for years and at most we’d laugh at how crazy tumblr bios. But she never showed this kind of behavior to real people/in person. Our friends are all types of LGBTQ people. She was the first person I came out to. 

I asked if she knew what a polysexual relationship was. She just said “yea it’s what Projared, Heidi, and Holly did.” I explained to her what it was and that it’s not open relationship or glorified cheating. She just said it was weird and the guy was obviously a player. I called her an ignorant asshole. 

I got so mad, I left her at the restaurant (I paid for my drink) and drove home. I felt that if I stayed and continued to listen I’d cause a scene. 

She recently texted me saying after I left, the tables next us started talking about her. An older woman called her a bigot on the way out. She had to take the train home. She said it was just her opinion and that I’m overreacting. That I’m a terrible friend for ditching her.

About a year and a half ago, we were just chilling at her place. I forgot I had a homework assignment due at midnight, so she let me use her computer to do it.

Well her homepage was reddit and I noticed she had over 900 messages. I knew she Reddits but the first thing that came to my mind was “Man, she has to be a karma whore to the extreme; what the fuck does she comment on?” So I went to her profile when I discovered, oops, that was her NSFW account. I x’d out almost immediately, finished my homework, and then just left it at that.

A week later, I was feeling horny, and I remembered about her account. It took a bit of digging, but I managed to find her account again, and spanked it to her. Ever since, I pretty much regularly masturbate to her. It’s not that I want to have sex with her, BUT she is hot, and the taboo nature of looking at someone I knew kept it alluring.

Anyways, I majored fucked up when hanging out with her today. Her boyfriend’s birthday was coming up, and she asked what she should give him. Like an idiot, I answered “you should give him a strip tease with those fishnets you have.” IDK why the fuck I said that; I had fishnets in my head because I spanked it that morning, and I forgot to realize that it was actually HER who posted a picture of herself in fishnets a couple days ago. She asked “how did I now she had fishnets” and I tried to just say I was joking, but I eventually admitted I knew her NSFW account.

She asked for how long and I was honest; for the better part of a year. She was **furious**.  She said those pictures are private pictures, and that they were not meant for my eyes. In all honesty, I think she’s being kind of ridiculous. How are you posting pictures of yourself online, then you’re mad that people jerk off to the pictures you post online?

I apologized for hurting her but maintained that SHE posted those pictures, and I just happened to find them (I didn’t mention I found them on her computer, but to my defense, she does have some identifying markings and a couple pictures where she shows most of her face; if she was trying for anonymity, she did a shit job). She said if I found her account, I should’ve just pretend I didn’t, and that she feels gross and violated and she wanted me to leave.

I feel like I’m going insane. If they were on her phone or something, I’d *completely* understand, but she invited herself to be jerked off to by the pictures she posted. Was I really unreasonable in jerking off to publicly posted pictures?

EDIT so I feel the need to explain that she wasn’t bothered by the “sexual” undertones in the joke at all. That’s just how we joke around, and if it wasn’t for the the fact that she just posted the fishnet pic, she would’ve laughed it off because that’s just how our relationship is. Also I’ve realized I now fucked up. I’m going to talk to her.

—-

**HUGE UPDATE**: So I tried calling her. She understandably didn’t answer, so I  decided to text her a huge apology instead. I also decided to call her boyfriend to apologize to him personally. To my surprise, he did pick up. I told him that I was sorry about everything and I’ve crossed some serious boundaries and that I’ll step away from the friendship if it’d make him comfortable. 

Well, he was completely confused and asked me to clarify. I told him that I figured my friend told him what happened, but the gist was that I found her NSFW account and hid it from her, and I violated her trust and I’m sorry. 

Well, he had absolutely NO idea what NSFW account I was talking about. So I sent him a link and he was dumbfounded. *He didn’t know the account existed*. I had no idea; I just assumed because they were dating, she’d of course tell him. 

He appreciated the fact that I told him, and he views as what she did as cheating, and confided is me that he’s going to break up with her.  I feel horrible for causing all of this drama. I’m a shit friend, and most definitely lost one of the best I’ve had, even if she was cheating. 

Ah well; life moves on. Here’s to a better tomorrow


—-


LAST EDIT because I’m getting a lot of replies 

I didn’t tell him to hurt her. Like I said, I was planning on stepping away from the friendship. Which is why I said above 

>	I’ll step away from the friendship if it’d make him comfortable. 

I told him because I assumed he knew about the NSFW account. You know, because they’re monogamous? And posting your naked body regularly on Reddit is typically something you tell your monogamous boyfriend. 

People are asking why I felt the need to apologize to him and not her. You just didn’t read the damn post. I tried apologizing to her. I called her. She didn’t answer. So I texted her instead. 

I just decided that IN ADDITION, I was going to apologize to him. Because I disrespected their relationship. 

I was asked “hey, why didn’t you rat her out a year ago?”

Because you numb-nuts; I DIDNT KNOW THAT HE WAS UNAWARE OF THE NSFW ACCOUNT. Why would I think she’s hiding a NSFW porn account from her boyfriend? That’s CLEARLY something you tell your SO. Jesus fucking Christ. 

I didn’t want to break them up. I wanted to apologize because I was told by 300 people that I’m a piece of shit. I tried, and I just made it worst. 

But it WASNT malicious. Period. And at the end of the day, she was (either by omission or explicitly) lying to him about this account. That’s not okay in a monogamous relationship, and she deserved to be called out. 

I’m NOT saying I’m not TA. On the contrary, I’m a huge piece of shit. Keep calling me a piece of shit; I deserve it. 

But stop saying I did this to hurt her. Stop saying I did this to ruin her relationship. I fucked up. I know. But none of this was malicious. None.

bydy8a	2019-06-08 23:26:13	ShittyUncle69	WIBTA for purposely avoiding to go to a traditionnal family vacation because my baby nephew will go as well?	"To start off, I (22 M) don't like babies and toddlers; I'm not a really patient person, and their behavior irritates me. Furthermore, the behavior used by adults to sometimes interact with babies and toddlers irritate me as well (such as baby talk and whatnot).

That being said, about a year ago, one of my sisters and my BIL had a baby, and they've been coming home about once per month and a half for about a day since then (I still live with my parents whereas they don't). From their few visits, I've noticed that albeit they're good parents, my nephew cries \*a lot\*, which I find really annoying.

I don't lose control over babies and toddlers, but I avoid contact with them as much as possible. When it gets really bad (albeit rare), I sometimes retreat for a few minutes to have a change of ideas. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate or dislike my nephew, I rather hate how he cries a lot and how annoying the other adults act around him. Please note that I don't have resent against my sister and BIL over them having a baby, they are good people and absolutely have the right to start a family and I have nothing against that.

One of our family tradition is  leaving for a week to a beach town in the US (I live in Canada) with my parents and siblings.

This afternoon, I just learned from my mom that my sister and BIL judged that my nephew is capable of going with us to the beach town, and thus will come with us to our traditionnal vacation.

As I was thinking about this, I'm thinking that it will be difficult to bear with my nephew for a full week since I need short breaks when he's there for only a day; I judged that it would be better for everyone if I were to stay home rather than go with them since I would have difficulty to tolerate my nephew.

When I was alone with my mom, I told her what I was thinking, and she said that she was thinking about it as well and had the very same thoughts. She also said that albeit she understood the logic behind the decision, that she would be devastated since my younger sister (19F) can't come because her job won't let her take vacations; we obviously wouldn't be telling the rest of the family that reason, I could actually give an excuse related to my job and vacation scheduling in order not to offend my sister/BIL.

WIBTA (or rather would I be \*an\* asshole) towards the rest of my family if I were to ditch the family tradition only because my nephew would be coming as well?

\*\*TL;DR\*\*: I hate babies. Nephew younger than a year old is coming with rest of family in a vacation for a week. I don't think I'll be able to tolerate him. I'm thinking of staying home instead. Does that make me an asshole or not?

&#x200B;

EDIT 1: I feel like I need to clarify this point since it's been mentionned a few times. I'm not outing him or consider him out of our family at all, I just have difficulty standing babies. It's absolutely not up to me to decide who's in or who's out."	No A-holes here	0	0

"My friend and I were out shopping, and it basically came up that I don't like to buy clothes in malls (I grew up poor, I have  weird feeling about spending lots of money on clothes). She got hurt and said she didn't want to be the only one shopping, and that she never wanted to shop with me again. I like shopping, but just didn't want to buy (everything at a mall is expensive). We left. Again, I like shopping to walk around and talk and find some cool things and styles, but don't like to buy right away (I'd rather be thrifting, using online discounts, clearance, etc). 

I took this encounter as we can enjoy the act of shopping even when not buying- and spending time together. But she sees it as we drove all the way to shop, so leaving without buying was a waste of time. She basically gave me the cold shoulder for the rest of the day. I understand we could have communicated this better before we went, but it already happened- so AITA for wasting my friend's time and making her feel like I only went because she wanted to?"

bydwue	2019-06-08 23:22:04	javajuiced	WIBTA if I didn’t attend my sister’s graduation?	"Hi all, this is my first post after lurking for a while. I decided to make my first post because of something that happened recently.

I’m 17f and I just graduated high school last week. It was really exciting and I was hoping for all of my family to be in attendance since I never thought I would be able to graduate. I didn’t plan on being at graduation as I tried to end my own life earlier this year in January. 

My sister is a 14f and she plays travel softball. A few days before my graduation, my mom asks me if it’s okay that my sister doesn’t attend my graduation. Of course I asked why, and she told me it was so my sister could play softball. A few weeks before this, we all agreed that my sister would play one day in the tournament (Saturday), and the next day (Sunday) she wouldn’t play so she could attend my graduation. I ended up telling my mom that if she wouldn’t attend my graduation, I wouldn’t attend her middle school graduation, which is about 10 days after my graduation.

My mom and sister are pretty pissed off at the fact that I kept my word and that I’m not going to my sisters middle school graduation this week. I came here to see if I’m overreacting. So, WIBTA if I didn’t show up to her graduation?

EDIT: There were a few comments about how I was talking about holding a grudge for a few years. I only said that I wasn’t going to go to her high school graduation because I was trying to change her mind. I’m going to go to that. I was asking about not attending her middle school graduation, which is in a few days from now."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I have been living with this roommate for almost a year now and we have always been good friends. Recently he has started rapping or writing in his free time. I had no problem with this. 

In the past month, a song came out that he was really into. Since then, he has been rapping a single verse from this song over and over again for 45-60 minutes at a time. I have asked him to maybe just do it less as it was kind of annoying hearing the same thing over and over again. This brings me to today. 

I was sitting in my room and he was rapping that one verse loudly over and over so I decided to say something. I mentioned that he had repeated the same thing about 30-40 times and just asked that he not do it on the weekend (I have my son on the weekend and can't wear headphones to block it out for obvious reasons). I have no issue with him doing this on weekdays. I also mention that if I was singing one song on repeat for that long he would also be slightly annoyed. He got upset and said he would just deal with it because it's me ""doing my thing."" He seemed hurt by what I had said and left the apartment rather quickly

bydufj	2019-06-08 23:14:39		AITA after my GF got blind drunk and vomited all over me and our bed?	"She is not great at handling her booze, and vomits quite frequently. She enjoys casual drinking but is not an alcholoic - it puts a strain on our relationship as i care for her health and i also have to tale responsibilty for her drinking.

About a year ago, she drank too much on her birthday and ended up being so drunk she was blacked out and ended up vomiting in our bed. At the time, i did what was necessary, i cleaned it up and looked after her. When she felt better i told her that seeing her in that state really scared me and that while i cleaned her up, it was something that i didn't enjoy. She agreed per se, but kept reitorating that she cant really keep count of drinking and enjoys getting swept up in the enjoyment, and that vomiting it out is a way of making her fell better. 

She has drank and vommed since - nothing as severe, i remind her of my stress about her health but she plays it down. 

Fast track a few hours ago, her friend and her were going out this evening. I came home after seeing a friend and went to bed. She ended up coming home at about 6am completely wasted with her friend laughing loudly, bumping into things and making a loud raquet, she came in talking to me so loudly as if she wasnt even aware i was sleeping and got into bed. I was pretty annoyed... just at her lack of considering me sleeping and what we've talked about. 

Half an hour later she sits up and proceeds to vomit a full meal and booze all over me and our bed. For a few minutes she didnt realise what had happened and was trying to shovel the vomit away from her. I got up and took the doona that was full of buckets of vomit and scooped it into a bag and and washed up. 

I came in and she just looked at me and asked me what was wrong, confused, i told her she vomited everywhere and she finally understood. I lost it and told that i was sick of doing this, that i have had enough and that she needed to grow up and that i was over her drinking. I called her selfish and that she doesnt consider me or her health and that i had to clean up after her. 

She said that she went out and had a good time, that this doesn't happen often and that she cant control her drinking when shes in the moment, that i was accusing her of doing this deliberalty and often to annoy me. That she cant help vomiting and that i dont support her through it. that i have shamed her in this instance and made her feel small, that i am holding this over her head as blackmail and guilt and now whenever she gets drunk shell be staying at her friends because i havent supported her. 

I said that had she been sick from a virus, and vomited id be there to clean up without judgement - but i cant keep looking after her shit choices.

bydu8c	2019-06-08 23:14:05	fenshanks	WIBTA if I quit my job over previously approved then revoked time off?	"Im a vet tech at a small under staffed hospital (5 doctors to 5 techs). End of Feb my single and solitary mum was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm which might have required open heart surgery if big enough. I told management that if she needed surgery, I would need to take time to care for her. We are an immigrant family and my brother and I are her only family in the US.

&#x200B;

Before I found this out, I had requested to swap a few working days (4 12s in the start of the week) so I could have a long weekend at the end of June for a person reason. This was approved.

&#x200B;

I stupidly told the lead tech (lower management, and a friend) that the reason I wanted time off was to have some stress free time to play FFXIV, as there is a new expansion that weekend. I am a pretty introverted person and many, if not all, of my friends are online. It is important to me. 

&#x200B;

It was clear in April that my mum would need surgery. The job gave me nearly 3 weeks and a lecture about how hard it was going to be on the team. I booked my trip. In the weeks leading up to my trip (after the surgery had already happened; my brother took care of the start), I was treated very poorly by my coworkers.

&#x200B;

Comments like ""don't complain, youre going on vacation"" or ""think about how hard it will be on us while youre on vacation."" I was made to feel guilty, and I was. I felt bad about leaving them short handed but I reminded them it wasn't a vacation. Mum's ribs were broken for the surgery, she couldn't shower alone, couldn't wipe her own ass and needed a diaper for a week.

&#x200B;

I went to take care of her, which was a full time job. I was mostly alone w/ her for 3 weeks and stayed away from FB/insta. There were 3 nights where a family friend took pity on me and offered to cover for a few hours so I could get a break. On these days, when things weren't so dark, I posted on FB. I got a tattoo (which took 30mins), I sat in the hot tub for an hour after being in the ER for 9, and I had dinner with an old friend. So, I shared them because my world was crashing and it made me feel better.

&#x200B;

I am back now and I have been met with hostility. Lead tech stated it was bullshit I got to laze around because of what she saw on FB. What was I supposed to say? ""LOL cleaning shit off my adult mother's ass...again?""

&#x200B;

She also revealed that management has plans to revoke the time off I requested very early in the year. I have no official word on this so I will bring it to them calmly, but this might be it for me. I did not take a vacation. I went to watch my mum become a frail old lady over the course of 3 weeks. I busted my ass @ work before & now after my trip. 

At this point it isn't even about a game, it's that I am not being valued.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I took 3 weeks to care for my mum after major surgery and now management is revoking a previously approved schedule-shift request because I ""just took loads of time off"". If I quit, AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

Now this guy is totally different, he's way more mature obviously and really cares about me and my character and my career plans it's just not describable how well he makes me feel.

byds2u	2019-06-08 23:07:35	Sarz122	WIBTA for quitting my job?	"    I graduated high school a month ago, and have been looking for a job for the past two. I've applied to over 30 different positions/places and have only landed two interviews. The first place to interview me never said anything back to me after, (Figure I probably didn't do too good, as it was my first interview), but the second interview it seems I did everything right, as I was hired immediately. I applied, was called within 12 hours of the application and hired within 48. 
    I'm still in training, but 3/5 days done with it as of today. I work in a truck stop, and to be honest, I do like it. The people are cool, and so far I've made friends with all of the people I've come across, and we really just kind of hit it off in general. Sadly, I'm in what feels like quite the pickle. I enjoy this job and the people, but I applied to another job I really wanted before this one, and I only took it because I needed some money. I have a pretty good chance of getting this job, as it's entry level, and my father works for the company so he can reference for me.
     The reason I'm heavily considering it, aside from getting to keep my super cool beard I had to shave for this job, is that my father is getting remarried in a month. I'm sure some of your are like ""What's the big deal Sarz122?"" Well, he intends to be leaving to move in with his wife. Which means that I'll be left with the house on the land my family owns to pay the bills, and I don't think (and neither does my father) that I'll be able to live comfortably (if at all) with part-time.

I was at the store earlier today in the frozen food aisle. I saw a guy in a wheelchair. I saw him with one item and then saw him open the door again and it seemed like he was staring at the top shelf. As I passed by ~20 seconds later, I said, “Sir, did you need me to get something off the top shelf for you?” I normally don’t interfere when something isn’t my business and I have no clue what came over me today. I tried to sound as deadpan/neutral/not sickly-sweet as humanly possible.

He said, “No,” and sounded really angry about it, which I absolutely understand. I said, “Okay,” and walked away. He yelled, “BYE.” I didn’t say anything, just got what I needed and pretended I wasn’t super embarrassed.

This happened a couple hours ago and I feel sick thinking about how I must have patronized him. I honestly should’ve apologized but I didn’t want to force him to interact with me more.

No, not always, but for most of my life (which isn't long then, so I hope I will grow out of this). I just got rejected so much in the former years, the only one not invited to a birthday, always set alone during breaks, etc. I don't think that it was ever really bad, but I just am a weak, stupid person that now has trouble with it. I just can't do normal social stuff. I mean, yeah I can, but I find it hard to reach out to people. (I am telling this to explain my behavior, though I guess that doesn't justifty the act). Talking to people I don't know is terrifying, I find it hard to talk to my aunts and uncles.  And it isn't that I didn't have 'friends', they just weren't really friends and never long. And I am bad at keeping relationships with my friends. I just never learned how to bc i didn't have them and I think that after not having friends, now I don't need them. Or try to tell myself I don't. Because right now I do have one friend, that I met at school. And since I left school the only way we can communicate is trough texts. And I ignore her texts. I think that for two weeks now I can see she has send me a text, but I ignore it. Don't open the app. I do this a lot of times. Eventually the guilt makes me open it and respond. I just don't want to respond. She is a great friend, an amazing friend and even though I don't know what loving friends is, I love her. But, I can't bring myself to respond. Because I will have to talk and I guess in my head there is a little voice saying 'ur going to fucking screw it all up and she is going to never talk with you again'.

"INFO: I (22M) am in possesion of my old family house that my father build around 23 years ago. Long story short everybody left the house and i was left alone here with astronomical bills. Started renting rooms to university students (great expirience) and then switched to ukrainian immigrants who mirate to seek better QoL. I turned to them instead of natives because they are ussualy ok with having a roommate (or even ask for one, probably to have sb to talk to in their language) but in the end its about the money, instead of one student who pays me 1X i get two guys who pay me 1.8X for the same room. Also students need a place to stay for a very strict period of time (obviously) and its just easier for me to menage the migrants who come/go more often.

&#x200B;

Problems:Those are young people (ussualy older than me tho) have no habits of cleaning anything around them and are suprised when i tell them to mop the floor (they have separate bathroom and stuff). They can go 4 days w/o showering   
dont take their shoes off and are constantly spilling coffe/suggar on the floor/countertop. And are generally really unpleasant to live with.

loose transcript of conversation because we both speak each other languages very badly which leads to a mix of languages that would be comical to hear to a bystander

him - im busy with work and i dont have time to do it (hes a taxi/uber or something and i see him slacking off fairly often)

me - we are all busy here and somehow we all find some time to clean

him - you dont work so you can clean the house, im very tired (i do work, just not everyday 9-5 job)

me \*(i fucking snap because i hate being abused)\* well either you will take the trash and clean now or go pack your things. Im not your fucking maid here \*i admit i actually insulted him here but its hard to translate\*

him - mumbles and curses and very slowly stands up to take the trash out.

Forgot to say while they have a separate floor and bathroom there is only one big kitchen for everyone.

Now i know that those people run from whatever the fuck is happening in ukrain (general poverty, shitty QoL) but things they do sometimes are borderline disgusting. Im not somebody who goes around with white gloves but i expect things to be civilized, not dirt casualy laying on the floor for days because dude doesnt sees it as a problem.

Obviously he has his own problems but i feel like im entitled to setting my own rules while renting rooms, on the other hand i dont want to be a tyrant who abuses their situation.

TL;DR Dude who rents room in my house refuses to clean and i told him to pack the trash or pack his bags and leave."	Not the A-hole	0	0

bydixy	2019-06-08 22:41:12		AITA for asking my mom to get a different brand of cat food for my cat?	"My mom got a whole entire bag of Purina Meow Mix and other grocery store cat foods which have been notorious for being unhealthy and sometimes even lethal towards cats. We adopted a stray a week or so ago and it's understandable that she got this food in a rush, but I'm worried because that cat is still sickly and has yellow mushy/diarrhea-ish poop, so I want to give it some healthier food, (we've taken it to the vet to get all its vaccinations btw). I asked my mom if we could get some healthier cat food because of all the evidence of these particular cat foods poisoning cats but she got extremely angry. She says that I'm wasting food. It feels like I invalidated all her efforts to help the cat and I know that she's really sensitive to this sort of stuff when it comes to food. Even with us, she always gets junk food for us and refuses to stop buying it and then blames me that I'm not fit because it's my choice to eat it even though it's gotten to the point where I'm addicted to the junk food she gets. I even get really bad withdrawals sometimes when I try to stop eating them. I want the cat to be the healthiest it can be and we have no financial problem when it comes to getting better food for the cat, but my mom has the ""eat what we have"" mentality even if it's not healthy, but it's logical and understandable (I guess). Any advice?"		1	0
bydhqf	2019-06-08 22:37:45		AITA for asking my mot to wear her wedding necklace?	"Context: y’all know what a wedding ring is, right? Same thing except Hindu women wear a gold necklace instead of a ring.

So, my mom hasn’t really been wearing it for about 5 yrs., she works in warehouse management and it’s not a great idea to wear a thick gold necklace in a warehouse. Now, she either works in her office for 3/5 days or from home 2/5 days.

I hadn’t given it much thought until recently, but I asked her to start wearing it again and I became a little pushy. This was a part of a much larger context heavy conversation. I don’t want to get into it.

She said before that the necklace was heavy and she didn’t like wearing it, and she has told me that if it was thinner she’d be more comfortable. But it’d been a few years since I asked her and she hasn’t really put in any effort to acquire a thinner strand.

There was also a short scare where it got lost inside of the house. We found it eventually, but that wouldn’t have happened if she had just been wearing it.

I just feel kinda uncomfortable/weirded out from her not wearing it.

***Note** I have a good relationship with my mom. I just feel that I may have been a bit of a dick to her.

This is a throwaway account because my parents know my main one. Recently after rummaging through a closet looking for a charger I found 2 packs of 20 cigarettes both almost empty. I immediately knew they were my mother’s. I love my mother a lot and can’t stand the fact that she has recently (I’m not sure it is recent) smoked 17 cigarettes. When I was 6 my mom claimed to quit smoking, around 2 years later I saw her putting a pack of cigarettes in her purse. I decided to confront her and let’s just say it didn’t end well. I realize many people smoke but I really do care for my mothers health. I’ve decided to keep a count of how many are left in the box daily.

Reddit: there are many ways to go about confronting her, but I need the one  in which my mother can hear my concern without freaking out about me snooping around...

bydh5w	2019-06-08 22:36:08		AITA for not using tickets that cost my dad $200?	"My family is from a small town, and there’s a big concert held there every year that’s a pretty big deal - and for the inconvenience of the town basically being shut down for this concert, some residents get free tickets to it.

We don’t qualify for free tickets anymore, but as it’s a small town you’ll always know someone who has spare tickets they’re not using.  

I haven’t lived with my dad in this town since I was a kid and my parents divorced, but we still keep in contact. I asked him last year if he’d know anybody who didn’t want their free tickets, and if so would he ask for them for me, and he said that was no problem, he’d get them easily.

Fast forward to this month. My life is incredibly hectic at the minute, a close family member died abroad, I had final exams and was moving house all at the same time. I’m still running around like a headless chicken, so I asked my dad if there would be any other family members who would appreciate the tickets because I wasn’t sure I’d make it to the concert after all. He asked if I was sure, I thanked him for getting them but said in case I can’t make it I wouldn’t want them to be wasted, so to pass them on to another family member.

On the day of the concert, he started telling other family members that he was incredibly angry because he ended up having to pay $200 for the tickets because he couldn’t get them for free after all and now I had just casually decided I didn’t want to go anymore.

I feel so incredibly guilty about it. I would have found a way to either go or get him his money back if I’d known he paid for them, but he hasn’t said it to me, he’s only saying it in secret to others so I’m not supposed to know he paid for them.

bydg8n	2019-06-08 22:33:30		AITA for spending time with my married friend?	"I became friends with a woman five years ago from work. She is 10 years older than me. At the time I met her, she was not married- she was dating a man. For reference, I met her when I was 19, I’m 24 now and I am a very openly (and obviously) gay woman. 
She ends up marrying that man soon after we met. I did not see her for a short period of time after she married. All good, we live different lives. 
About two years ago, we reconnected at a bar and had a good time talking, just like before. Except, we really got so much closer. Since then, we have met up occasionally to talk more. We have several common interests and just naturally enjoy each other’s company. 
Last night, she invited me over to her home (married so she of course lives with her husband). I had never met him before. You’re probably wondering why I have never met her husband. We don’t live very close to each other so it’s often that we see each other at a bar halfway or for lunch during the workday or weekend. I decided to make the drive over since a few other mutual friends of ours were going to be there. 
Let me get to the point: I end up meeting the husband, “Dave”, and he is wondering why I am there, hanging out with my friend who is older and why I came over (he is also ten years older). His body language and behavior tells me that he is suspicious of me. I make conversation with him and everyone there, even people I never met before. But of course I am spending slightly more time with my friend. 
Since my friend and I naturally make good conversation, and I don’t see her often, we end up talking for a while. It gets to the point where “Dave” is constantly interrupting our conversation and interjecting himself. He would frequently make reference to the fact that he was fucking my friend in a “subtle” manner. (Territorial?) Of course everyone is drinking so that may be a factor to this behavior. I did my best to respectfully respond to “Dave” when he approached me, but as the night went on he began to approach me in a more belligerent manner. I decided to instead talk for a while to a guy that I had just met that night. We discussed music extensively, but I was mostly trying to just get “Dave” off my back. 
For another point of context, my friend is very touchy- she will frequently grab my arm or touch my hair in a light and playful way. This doesn’t bother me, a lot of my friends do this. But I made it a point to NOT reciprocate this last night. At one point she was rubbing my shoulders and was suggesting that I rub her shoulders. (I did not!) So yeah, I get it. This may have also been an influence to “Dave’s” behavior. 
So, with all of that being said, am I the asshole for coming over to see my friend and spending most of the time there talking to just her? I feel like I can’t accurately judge this situation. I would like to discuss the situation with her more but I don’t know what to say."		1	0

bydcg6	2019-06-08 22:22:22	Lunarwolf12	AITA for picking out an expensive group gift for mother's day.	"My parents are hard to shop for and sometimes won't tell us what they wanted for mother's day. My mother's laptop was breaking down. I asked my two siblings to go in on a midrange laptop for her that costed a little over $500 and they both agreed. At the time, my older sister was a little reluctant as her normal price range is $25-40. She might have felt pressured because my little sister was in and dad heard our plan and offered to pay a portion if we just told him how much. I picked out the laptop and paid for it, but told my older sister she was in charge of dividing up how much each person owed (she has a job dealing with money and I already did most of the work and wasn't doing this too.) 

Yesterday I reminded her that she hasn't divided up the bill. One of my sisters put in less money (which all of us knew would happen) so we needed to figure out who would cover the amount leftover. We subtract little sisters portion and all that's left is to find out how much we want my dad to pay. She askes me if we can do it a diffetent way: divide the cost in four and have my dad pay a fourth and the portion little sister didn't pay. I said no as it's a mother's day present and he was already being kind offering to pay anything. She settles for subtracting little sisters portion then each paying a third. Then she gets mad at me that she spent more than she normally would and it was my idea. AITA? Should I let my dad pay the same as me and older sister? Was it wrong of me to suggest getting my mother a more expensive but useful gift?

Background info:

1. Older sister makes the most and has a decent job she had to get a masters degree for. She has paid off her student loans and isn't hurting for money.

2. Little sister lives at home, is in community collage and has a part time job. She doesn't have a lot of money.

bydagb	2019-06-08 22:16:23	dark_phoenix86	AITA for deciding to leave my rock band because of an offensive remark by one of my bandmates?	"  

I am in a local rock band with some of my really good friends, including a guy named Adam (not his real name) who has this really weird sense of humor. We’ve been friends for years because of our shared interest in music. Anyway, he got a knack for really crazy elaborate pranks and would occasionally embarrass us in public just for fun. Most of the time his pranks were harmless and I have to say, really creative and funny af, though sometimes he made me really embarrassed that I had to excuse myself immediately. One of his recurring jokes (and his favorite) whenever one of us was hanging out with him was the gay prank. He would say something really embarrassing casually, loud enough for everyone else to hear to give the impression that we’re a gay couple.

Like that one time we were standing in line at a department store, and he started telling me casually like “Hey baby, I went to that shop today and got you that cute pink butthole you like.” I was absolutely mortified and got really upset with him but of course when he told our friends about it later, everyone started laughing their asses off, to my dismay. I thought he needed to tone it down a little bit just in case it backfired or something. But he would not listen.

Last week, we were hanging out at our usual favorite coffee shop with some of our old friends that we had not seen for ages and Adam of course could always be counted upon. We were talking about our first masturbation attempt when suddenly he casually blurted out to me like “Hey, why don’t you tell them about that one time your uncle helped you polish the riffle?”. Some were laughing (including my bandmates) but the rest knew he had gone too far this time.

To say I was embarrassed was an understatement. I felt hurt and betrayed that he, as my friend, could have the heart to make fun of such a traumatizing experience I had to endure as a child. That’s when I decided that I’d had enough of his stupid jokes. I stood up from my seat, called him an asshole and told them I no longer wanted to be associated with the band for good.

Later the next day he tried to reach me through my phone several times but I ignored him so he sent me a long heartfelt text telling me that he felt bad and did not mean to humiliate me in front of so many people and that he would apologize to me in public if necessary. But I was so furious with him so I texted him back to tell him that I would not change my mind since I had a feeling he was not sincerely feeling sorry for his action, he only cared about the band falling apart since we have already submitted our band to participate in an upcoming rock festival we’d been practicing for for months. And I am still feeling hurt that he could be so insensitive and act like such an asshole.

My friends think I am overreacting and should not let it affect the rest of the band. Am I The Asshole?

 When I was born, my parents were 16 and 17 and obviously were not married and had no money. I never went hungry, and I am grateful, but I never really had much beyond that growing up like my half-siblings, 1, 2, 3, 5, do now. Fast forward about 3 years after I am born,  like most young couples, my parents divorce and stay single for a while. Not only that, my parents have a terrible relationship sometimes not even on speaking terms, and my father moves 8 hours away and I visit my father in the summer. I continue to bounce around school to school and house to house until I eventually graduate, which happened last year. During HS, my father remarried to somebody that is also working, becomes financially stable and has 4 kids. 

This is not the case for any of my younger siblings (all my father's) as they get everything they want. Tablets, games, the newest toys, and 2 married parents that aren't constantly worried about money like I did when I was younger. They have even set up a college fund which I never even dreamed of.

I am not ashamed to admit I am jealous, but I am wondering if this makes me an asshole."	Not the A-hole	1	0

byd988	2019-06-08 22:13:00	Woodgnome	AITA for asking the person sitting next to me to stop recording a symphony concert for her daugther?	"I just came home from a theme symphony concert playing popular movie/TV fantasy themes (Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, etc.).

During the first half the lady next to me had her phone out recording/taking pictures intermittently - no biggie, not what I would do, but it wasn't bothered initially. After the intermission she went into non-stop recording until I had enough and asked her to stop (I was waiting for a pause between performances, but they were performing a suite, so it might have been 15-20 minutes into the second half). For me that meant having someone waving their phone (on lowest light setting) just within my peripherial vision, focusing and zooming in/out non-stop - disturbing enough that my attention was now on her and her phone instead of the concert.

The conversation went something like this:

- Me: ""I'm sorry, could I ask you to put your phone down for the remainder of the concert?""
- Her: ""Why?""
- Me: ""Because it's sort of distrubing.""
- Her (holding her phone up at recording height): ""This is disturbing to you?""
- Me (trying to cut it short, because the orchestra started playing again - even though I wanted to explain that I don't want to be annoying or anything like that, she's just doing something diverts my attention away from something I paid a fair amount of money to enjoy): ""Well... Yes.""
- Her: ""But it's for my daughter!""

At that point I rolled my eyes at her and leaned back in my chair, because what could I possibly say to that without appearing to be a complete asshole? What I really wanted to say, though, was ""WHY DIDN'T YOU BUY A TICKET FOR HER THEN!!!??"". She paused recording for a couple minutes, but went back to it not long thereafter. I spent the rest of the concert torn between being annoyed, feeling a bit rude and failing at enjoying the concert.

Mind you, this is a symphony orchestra owned by Danish national television that records many of their concerts (including *every* theme concert I've attended) with multiple cameras and not only posts it to their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGtAoge4_OloSgbXMyoh5vw), but often also show the concerts in full length on one of the national TV channels (which are open to everyone as long as they access the site from within Denmark). Granted, they do have one of their cameras mounted on telescopic camera crane, which can be quite annoying, but it's always in the same spot, so you can get seats where it's not an issue."

We both spilt the dishes and party cleaning for a while, very well if I could add. Then I got a new job, it pays quite a bit more then my previous gig but has me working weird hours all the time.

My SO said that she couldn't quite afford living at our current apartment with her old job, which she has recently got a new one that's close to on par with my current income.

I proposed an agreement for her to clean and me to pay all the utilities and extra bills other then rent. She agreed happily.

I think it might be taking a tole on her and I honestly feel bad but it's at least 350 A month for utilities. For that money im pretty sure I could have someone come in and clean once or twice a month.

In recent months she has kinda let cleaning go to the wayside, as well as buying a 2016 newish car. The cleaning had kinda fine to the wayside and I'm kinda worried I'm just paying for nothing other then our happiness and internet of course.

Last night a gay bar shut down an entire city block for the night to throw a massive block party in the center of the city. I met up with one of my gay friends who introduced me to another of his gay friends and 2 of our other straight friends all went out to have fun.

at the gay bar, i was getting hit on a bit and told the guys i was flattered but straight, most were cool with it and that was that but one guy got mad and told me that if i was straight, i shouldn’t be hanging out at a gay bar during pride. he got all pissed off and stormed away.

then we decided to go back to my friend’s apartment around the corner to smoke a little weed before coming back out to party. i found a rainbow headband he had gotten at a party this week and decided to throw it on for the festivities.

we went to another bar and i was outside smoking when this girl came up to me and, seemed like she was flirting. she literally just came up and handed me her phone and told me she wants my number because she thought i had a “good energy” and wanted to hang out when we weren’t drunk outside of a bar at 3am.

she was pretty cute, i made some small talk with her and gave her my number, then her guy friends who i guess were gay came up to her and said i was cute and she tried to match us up i think but i told her i was straight and all of them pushed a little bit like “you don’t like guys at all?” and “wow, i totally thought you were queer.”  and everyone looked visibly disappointed before cutting the conversation short and leaving.

i still plan on going to the parade tomorrow with my friends and likely being colorful and drinking in the gayborhood all day, but i don’t want to be a constant disappointment to everyone, haha.

it’s not even like i’m new to the gay bar scene. i’ve been to gay bars quite a few times with my gay friends, it’s just during pride, i guess, for some reason a lot more people have a problem with me participating as an ally.

byd7bk	2019-06-08 22:07:41	Schwizz5	AITA for being upset that my wife doesn't do more around the house?	"My wife and I both work second shift, her at an office and I at a factory. I have weekends off, and her ""weekend"" is Monday and Tuesday, normally. 

I've recently voiced to her that it feels like I am doing the majority share of the housework, and household duties. She disagrees with me of course. On a regular basis, I am the one who wakes up early with the kids and gets them around for school. I do 98% of the grocery shopping during the week and cooking on the weekends. I also do 100% of the washing of dishes and laundry, taking out trash, yard work. Before I go into work most days I will sleep and mop floors if they need them, and most days it's needed because we have 3 dogs and two cats who shed like it's their job. 

What she would do on a regular basis is pick up the kids from school, and help them with homework if she can. More often than not I'm called at work to help with math and grammar. 

On my days off, if she is working, she will leave me with a list of stuff to do, and if it isn't done when she gets home she gets really pissed off as if I had a time limit. On her days off, most of her time is spent relaxing because she's ""exhausted"" from her job. Her reason for doing this is because has to work weekends, and I told her it doesn't matter because she still gets two days off in a row. She doesn't cook, most meals are either fast food or she calls up her mom to take her and the kids out to eat, which she does most of the time. So when I come home that night, I either have their leftovers or I have to make my own food. 

The only things that she doesn't exclusively is clean the bathroom and fold the clean laundry, which she lets pile up to five baskets full before she does it, and then complains that there is so much of it. 

Next week we are going on vacation and I have been working all week trying to get the house in shape before we go. Earlier this week when she had the chance to help out in that regard, she chose instead to go shopping with her mom. Then later in the week gave me a list of stuff that still needed done and that I would have to do it because she works this weekend. I got upset and told her that it would have been nice if she had done some of the things on her list to help out, and I said she was being lazy. She got pissed and left to hang out with a friend. Today, I have mowed the yard, cleaned the garage, done 3 loads of laundry, did dishes, swept and mopped all the floors, and cooked 2 meals for our kids. I'm exhausted, and then was so pleased to get a call from my wife saying she wasn't coming home after work, she's going to go play bingo with some of her work friends.

I am kind of anti social and have social anxiety so I have a hard time getting close to people and being around anyone besides my direct family is hard-ish. The 2 people I interacted with the most(out of 5), I'd say we're moving too quickly. I don't mean it in a weird way, but at the same time weird, at least I thought so. Hugging, grabbing (hugging) from behind, putting/resting their chins on top of my head, patting my head and picking me up. This made me extremely uncomfortable. I didn't want to deal with that so I slowly started to distance my self from them. This quickly turned into flat out ignoring them. One of the two talked to me and I told her why I was ignoring them. I agreed to talk to her again because she wasn't as physical as the other one.

byd678	2019-06-08 22:04:49		AITA for leveraging my mother’s cancer diagnosis to cleanse my academic record?	I’m applying to highly selective universities soon and I had a couple of ‘W’ grades (withdrawn) on my transcript that would surely prevent me from acceptance. I took these W grades because I was not doing as well as I would have liked in the classes and it’s better to have a W than a grade that could tank my GPA. At the same time that I had to take these W grades, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. This didn’t affect me much because it was under control and they discovered it very early, but I leveraged this to my counselor and put on a fake crying show to have these W marks removed from my record. I told my mother that I did this and she said that she doesn’t mind, but my friends seem to think I’m an asshole for doing it because I didn’t have an actual reason to remove those Ws and I was abusing a system in place for people that actually had good reasons. I think that even though it’s abusing the system, it won’t make enough of a difference that it’ll matter in the long run accept for increasing my chances to get in to schools, plus my mother didn’t have a problem with it.

byd5b4	2019-06-08 22:02:33	MagicRat3	AITA for not wanting to hang out with my close friend when his girlfriend is around?	"Recently my close friend started dating a girl who I find unbelievably unattractive (I feel like an asshole just saying that but I really can't mentally get around that) and she is extremely insecure. She is always giving him crap about everything and is just a terrible girlfriend in general. She has threatened to break up with him over random crap all the time and has gotten pissed off at him for no reason.

My friend has kept asking me to hang out with him and his girlfriend and I've been saying no. Honestly, it's because I think she is very unattractive, insecure, and immature. But it also is because my friend is known for being irreverent and a bit of a daredevil which is why we got along so well, but when he is with her he seems to be sucking up to her every wish. Ever since meeting her, he has completely changed a lot of his personality, especially when he is around her. I went to hang out with them once and she seemed uncomfortable, and I really disliked just kind of sitting and watching them be gross and kind of whining about each other in a flirty way.

I kind of also dislike her for convincing my friend to cancel a trip that him and I had planned because her tattoo was messed up, but she was out of town for the week and didn't show up back in the area until *after* the trip would have been over.

But I feel like I could handle more of her if she wasn't so unattractive and insecure which I feel is kind of asshole-ish.

EDIT: I think I am the asshole for focusing on her looks. Will be an attitude I need to work on. But I'm not sure about being annoyed by her insecurity."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

This wasn't my school's prom, and I was just going in with a group of friends from that school and without a date. I already owned a black suit(black pants, suit jacket, tie, and a white button down with some brown shoes) because of the private school I go to. She figured I was being too boring and that should be for Senior Prom, so she wanted to go shopping for a new suit. I told her that I objected many times, but she took it as being ungrateful and rude. All I wanted to do was dress sharp and see if I can meet new people. She wanted the same, but wanted something other than a ""traditional black suit"" and more colorful.

So she dragged me along to the mall and she picked out a dark blue suit. I said ""heck no, blue is my least favorite color,"" to which she looked at me with an annoyed look and said, ""you're gonna wear it."" I'm still telling her that I dont want to wear that and she shouldn't be able to determine what kind of suit I want to wear. She wasn't having any of it and wouldn't comment, until I strongly said, ""mom listen, I don't want to wear that thing and you shouldn't be able to make me, especially if it's not your prom.""

She said, ""I am your mother and you will do as I say and listen to me no matter what, you have no right to speak to me that way."" 

Throughout the way of trying it on and bringing it to the cash register, I expressed my displeasure, but she's still thinking I'm an ""ungrateful little bastard"" and that ""I dont see or appreciate the things [she's] trying to do for me."" After Junior prom, it was the same thing, but I dont say a word and I dont feel like I should apologize for something I never wanted her to do, and disliked the idea in the first place.

Basically, I have told her she is out of line which she didn't appreciate. I told her in private and respectfully so she wouldn't get too defensive about it.

She hasn't taken it well and has stopped talking to me and trying to turn people against me. It seems crazy she would do this all to hide her secret.

I'm in a situation I didn't ask to be put in. Her husband and family have turned on me, giving me the cold shoulder. I can't reveal her secret to clear my name as her husband would be angry I didn't say anything sooner but also it would mess up her family (they have kids involved).

So am I the asshole for keeping quiet, even though I'm getting grief in return? Even the husband is being a dick to me and he has no idea I've been defending him! 

I can see what kind of person she is now, even if it all comes out one day I have no desire to be friends with her. I no longer trust her after she turned on me (And turned everybody else) I have stopped talking to her now, but unfortu6see her most days and have no choice but to bump into her.

Nobody seems to have questioned that this is very unusual, surely they must think something has gone off or that there's more to the story.

byd22s	2019-06-08 21:53:47	annoyedroommate1	AITA Being a bad roommate on purpose.	"&#x200B;

So, my roommate and I are both university students and share a room in our dorm. The room is small, honestly it's not big enough for 2 people but we're kinda tolerating our situation.

&#x200B;

At first, everything was fine. She seemed nice and we even hanged out for a bit. However, soon I noticed major differences between our lifestyles. I am an introvert with a few friends and she is an extrovert with many friends. Even our habits and routines were different. I was okay with that, I understand that different people exist and that living with roommates can't be easy so I was open for compromises. Every time she said something bothered her, such as me watching shows without earphones, I would fix it in order to not bother her. As time passed, she would complain about more and more things, such as me leaving a mug on my table or not taking out the trash (I was not using that bin, only her). No matter how much I tried to be a good roommate in her eyes, it never worked.

&#x200B;

Soon I started to avoid my room. I would leave at 8AM and return at 8PM, spending half my day taking my classes and the other half studying in the university library. Even at my dorm, I would go to the studying hall so that I would not bother her. I started to resent my room and avoid it at all cost because she was so suffocating all the time. She also (still) does some stuff that I hate, such as studying in the room with lights on until 2AM when I just want to sleep, not locking the door at night and opening the window and curtains during the evening (while the lights are on) which made me feel unsafe because anyone could see into my room (plus the mosquitoes bit me a lot). No matter how many times I have told her this, she refused make a compromise and kept saying that ""I need to get used to living with other people"" or if she somehow did listen to me, she would be obviously irritated because how dare I.

&#x200B;

Anyways, recently I decided to put an end to this and started doing the things I wanted to do. I started listening to music without earphones (not loudly, people outside the room could not hear it) which she hates (I guess she really hates the Beatles), started being messy (even though I also hate it) and started to close the window/turn the light off/other stuff that bother her. When she would ask me to stop, I would just say that ""She needs to get used to living with other people"" and that I will not stop because this is also my room and I also pay rent. 

However, today she started yelling at me, calling me insane and threatening that she's going to complain about me. She attacked me with some false info (straight-up lies about her behaviour) while I was calm. I just told her that I am going to continue behaving like this because I don't want to follow her orders. It's not like she can't use the studying hall (I use it all the time) or compromise. I also live here.

"In February I ordered (online) two shirts from a small business because they contain funny, witty, or political sayings across the front and back and I like supporting small businesses. 
The owner of the business does pretty much everything on their own so they note a 6-8 week turnover for orders. 
After a while I kind of forgot I ordered them, but remembered and have emailed the owner twice. After not hearing back over email I sent a Facebook message (we're friends on Facebook). Still nothing, though I can see that she hasn't read my Facebook messages.

bycym1	2019-06-08 21:44:12	GreenScreenMonster	WIBTA if I gave my best friend a reality check?	"My best friend and I are both in our mid-twenties, and I feel frustrated by her lack of motivation over the past year. We both graduated from undergrad over a year ago. She took a gap year and afterward wanted to enter a professional degree program at a certain university that she, unfortunately, didn’t get into. This program is offered elsewhere, but she isn’t interested in going. Complicating things, this profession has always been difficult to enter, but within the last few months, positions decreased severely. This means if you want a job in this field, you likely must move, sometimes to remote areas or out of the country. She didn’t think of a backup plan and is in limbo for another year while she waits to reapply for the same program. I should note that this program is about $20,000.

In the gap year that she wasn’t in school and waiting to enter this program, she settled for a part-time retail job with minimal hours, as she refuses to work weekends. This wouldn’t bother me if it wasn’t for the fact she accumulated serious debt in undergrad (+$40,000) and I feel like she’s wasted a golden opportunity to pay off debt and save for future education by working as much as possible, since she doesn’t pay rent, has her own car, and has no dependents. I can understand not wanting to be a general labourer as a career after you’ve obtained a degree in something radically different, but I feel there is a responsibility to pay off the debt, and it’s just for a year.

Right now, she has few (resume proven) marketable skills and would benefit from doing an internship or a one-year post-grad diploma in a related field. The problem is, doing something like that would likely require leaving our hometown/the few cities she wants to live in. Additionally, she’s expressed that she doesn’t have an interest in some of these professions since they earn significantly less than her ideal profession.

I have spoken to her directly about her mental health, and she was confused but appreciative when I brought it up, so I don’t think there is a serious mental health issue like depression holding back her motivation.

WIBTA if I had a “come to Jesus talk”, laying out that she needs to prepare for the reality that she will have to move if she wants to pursue her ideal profession, or if she wants to stay close to our hometown, she may not be able to enter her ideal profession? The reason I think this would make me TA is that I don’t think another person (who isn’t a parent) saying she needs to get her shit together is all that useful. Plus, I admittedly don’t know that much about options she would have with a BA in English, so blind leading the blind. Also, I’ll probably come off as patronizing, since I’ve found a full-time job in my field and appear to have my shit together, but this is only due to the amount of hustle I put into internships during undergrad and my willingness to move around.

Thanks for reading!

Update: Hi everyone! Just wanted to say thanks for reading and commenting, I really do appreciate it. To reiterate a response that I gave in the comments, I definitely was expecting to be the asshole and I am glad to be called out on my hypothetical behaviour. To clarify something, I don’t expect my best friend to follow my “life plan” for her, rather I want to give her a heads up about how difficult the job market can be, especially if you’re limiting your search to three cities all close together. I wish I could say that I was a super ambitious go-getter and that’s why I have so much internship experience, but it was a requirement of my program to have a certain number of internships to graduate. Getting my first internship felt sort of like surviving the zombie apocalypse (I had 50+ applications and 2 interviews), and many of my friends didn’t get a job, and I only got one then because my employer had to do a second round of interviews. Graduating feels a lot like applying for that first internship again, as you quickly realize no one owes you a job despite all your great experiences. That being said, you got to let people figure their lives out for themselves and I shouldn’t be judgemental that she’s still doing that. One thing I would want to point out is that she would be fantastic in her ideal profession and I really want her to succeed, but I also want to understand that she isn't willing to move around in order to pursue it. 

P.S. We’ve been best friends for over twenty years (since kindergarten) and we talk almost every day despite me living all over the place, she’s basically my sister and I don’t foresee me or her ever breaking our bond. 😊"	Asshole	0	0

&#x200B;

I really need honest opinions since I am utterly torn on what to do at this point, I am honestly afraid I am the asshole here.

&#x200B;

So to give a little pretext,  I am a 21 year old guy with a very troubled family history,I wont go into detail since it would take up an entire books worth of space, let's just say my childhood was horrible.

&#x200B;

So let's start, my youth was an absolute mess, I have a brother{Several years older} with several severe behavioral issues, this essentially resulted in him taking up all my mothers attention when we were little and it resulted in me being humiliated by him all the time, alongside emotional abuse, physical abuse, far beyond the level of normal brotherly fights so to say

&#x200B;

My highschool years were arguably even worse, I ended up getting extremely sick and was out of commission for 2 years, what was worse was the fact that my family apart from my parents did not believe I was sick/faking it, my brother was jealous of the attention I was getting as a result of being sick and all my friends ditched me.

&#x200B;

So now we just skip ahead to today, I am now still living at home and basically being told I am lazy and a bother to everyone because I am not functioning well, I am extremely anxious about everything, have extreme issues connecting with people, I have extreme trust issues with people going to the extent of me cutting friendships short because I assume they will just hurt me when they get to close, as for relationships, I seem to have lost all desire for them. I seem to be emotionally inept, like I don't seem to know what things like love and caring about feel like, like I have had relationships where I just end up being utterly confused when she tells me she loves me or something of the like, it's like I can't fathom the concept of someone loving me and I don't know how to love her. And well I have reached the point where in my head I am so utterly unhappy and without the ability to fix myself where I literally tell myself to keep living for simplistic shit like ""Oh, this and that game is coming out next month."". So recently I have made a deal with myself, I need to get a job, need to move out, get a decent degree and cut ties with my family to even have a chance of someday functioning as a normal human being, but there is one problem, my mother, she is the only person who ever cared about me and if I keep her around it means keeping my entire family around {Don't have enough characters left to explain why} So, what should I do and am I an asshole for even contemplating this?"		1	0

bycwap	2019-06-08 21:37:53		AITA for getting annoyed when other families take over my campsite?	"I get it. I live in a crowded city. There’s a lot of people and it’s almost impossible to go out and enjoy nature without encountering other people trying to do the same thing.

Last weekend I went out to a campsite outside of town. I took a half a day off work so I could get out early and stake out a spot for myself and some friends that would allow us to do the whole thing. Have a fire, stay up and have a few drinks, listen to music. 

When we arrived there was nobody there. Perfect. We had the whole lake to scope around and find the perfect spot. There were a couple of sites next to us but everything was empty. There was no way things would fill up. I tried to find a site where we could have some privacy and not annoy other families when things got a little crowded eventually. 

We find our spot. Set up camp and less than 2 hours later, the only other family we’ve seen shows up and sets up camp. RIGHT NEXT TO US. The entire lake and all the campsites were still empty. There were acres of land with other campsites they could have enjoyed. They had 2 kids and were very respectful, but I knew if anything, we would end up being the rude ones as a group of young campers having a good time staying up late. 

Sure enough 10pm rolls around. “Quiet time hours.”
The husband promptly walks over to our campsite to inform us we have to turn our music OFF as he had children trying to sleep. I was frustrated by this and I let everyone know, including him as he had plenty of other space to have his quiet time.

My friends quickly pointed out that he’s right and there’s not much we can do in this situation. So we ended up calling it an early night as that interaction killed the whole vibe for most of us."		1	0

bycv66	2019-06-08 21:34:44	AshtonTheInfinitieth	WIBTA? Planning to leave my family as soon as I can and never look back	"My parents are religious (I'm agnostic; they don't know), I'm nonbinary (they know and think I'm making it up/transgender isn't a real thing), and the entire family is a ball of stress.

We do agree on some things (e.g. libertarian ideology). But whenever I'm around my female parental unit (hereafter referred to as fpu) I feel stifled. I hate being around her. 

She told me that if I married someone who wasn't from her ('our') religion, she would disown me, mourn me as if I were dead, write me out of her will. Neither of my parents support same sex marriage and they'd probably try to dissuade me from marrying someone of the same sex as me. Probably wouldn't come to the wedding. Good. I wouldn't want them there to ruin my happy day.

Recently she called me an it, which I think was because she was tired and anxious and overworked. She hasn't apologised, and acts as if it never happened. I've asked her multiple times not to call me 'pretty girl' or things of that nature and she still does it. I've given up on getting her to stop.

She makes jokes sometimes how I'm her only daughter and she wishes I would (let her play with my hair/enjoy clothes shopping with her/wear jewelry). I'm pretty sure she's half joking. She has a PhD in psychology and jokes about how I'm 'separating and individuating'.

But she let me go to a nonreligious college. She didn't kick me out when she forced me out of the closet. She let me wear pants. I could have it so much worse. I'm not physically abused.

Fpu is trying to be a good parent, and raise her kids religious. She wants me to be happy. But currently the two things are mutually exclusive for me, and she would probably force me to go back to a religious school if she knew, probably would take away my internet access. She took away my phone a few nights ago with no warning and no explanation. The next day when I asked her about it, she said she didn't want me going on my phone at night. Wtf; she could have just told me not to do that. I told her so and she didn't have much of a response. She never did anything like that before.

When I turned nine she bought me roller blades for my birthday. I remember being very excited about the present but terrified that she'd get angry at me for something. More recently I stay in my room a lot because I can't stand being around her. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't type of situation. She tends to be in permanent bad moods and I don't want to be the person who pisses her off then, so the easiest thing to do is stay away.

I don't know how to tell her that she's trying to get me to be happy and religious wrong, so I'm not going to tell her until I'm financially independent, if ever.

I don't think she's a narcissist, as she doesn't match most of the traits listed in the resources in r/raisedbynarcissists. I'm probably just overreacting, right?

A bit of backstory. We're going to vacation next week and we booked the flight about a month ago.

So It's vacation so I stay up pretty late but always sleep around 12am. So 12am hits and I decide to sleep when my mom went in my room to ask me to get the luggages for her to pack. We live in a small house so the luggages are in a small little corner behind my bed that are stacked. I was really wanting some sleep at this point so I wanted it as done as quickly as possible. When I asked which one she specifically wanted she said ""That one at the very bottom."" These were not that heavy being empty but they're large so when I place the others on my bed to try and get the last one I started complaining to myself that she could've done this earlier. She was free from 7-12 sitting at the bed playing Toon Blast or whatever and watching TV, combined with my sleep deprivation I was getting pretty negative. When I finally reach the bottom my mom said ""Why didn't you just hold the other stack to against the wall (there were two stacks, I took both down, plus they're held by the wall on one side, and my guitar box ((mostly empty, pretty heavy)) on a crappy old coffee table that'll most likely make it fall and damage my stuff on the other side of the box. And I knew I had to take the other stack down as the last one was huge and the other stack clearly will get in the way, so I explained this rather aggressively because of my sleep (or lack thereof) and I thought it was the end of it. Until she said aggressively in return ""What kind of boy scout are you if you can't figure this stuff out?"" 

More backstory

At Grade 9th you have to attend some Boy Scouting, basically Mandatory Military Service but less extreme and more about keeping our school's peace and order. Few weeks ago the school gave out a letter which the parents have to sign basically outlining what my basic duties are and my timings. It CLEARLY said on the paper that it was mandatory you sign and I also told my mom same day that letter was given was it was mandatory. She clearly didn't give a flip cus when my dad came home for both of them to sign she asked ""So is he joining?"" because in these types of letters there's usually an option to not join so maybe she got used to the old system, but there was no box for you to check if you want to opt out and once again had they read the letter it states mandatory. 

So when she said that Boy Scout comment at me I went full on mad and screamed at her that it was mandatory and I'm forced either way anyway. Coupled with the fact that she decides fixing our stuff nearly last min made me super mad.

She got mad too and I got mad.

I fixed the luggages she didn't take back to the pile and thought about what had just happened.

I'm kinda relieved that it happened as otherwise she would've woken me up to do the same stuff and I don't like being woken up so I knew it would've turned out worse.

byctjr	2019-06-08 21:30:19	rsbronn	AITA for kind of wanting to stop being friends with an online friend?	"I'm a guy and I met this girl online a few months ago. We're both early 20s. We've just been friends and we spent a lot of time talking and watching stuff, I care about her a lot but I'm not really interested in the way the friendship is currently going. 

She's slept with a lot of guys in the last year and goes on about them in conversations. I've tried giving her advice about it all through the many conversations she's brought up some guy. But in the past few days, she has been talking about a guy who she's ""using"" to get to another guy who is famous, and she said the famous guys friend tried flirting with her but she turned him down because ""she would never"" sleep with him. Fast forward a day or two, and this girl randomly tells me that she slept with the guy she said she would never have slept with. 

I'm not interested in the girl that much in terms of an online relationship or meeting her in the future. but I just feel it's weird and think she might view me as something I'm not. She said to me the other day that ""sometimes I think you're a girl"" because I understand how she feels about guys and I took that very offense as a straight male. I don't want to be a guy who is used simply to relay this girls boy problems, I want a friend who I can talk to and watch stuff with which is what we were for the first couple of months or so. She's just turned really weird and I don't know how to approach her about this, I'm just fed up or all the boys she brings up to me. I don't know why she does it."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
byct8s	2019-06-08 21:29:25	Whatever_ho	AITA for quitting my job?	"Backround info:

I (18f) have been working in a gas station while going to school for about a year and a half now. My boss was a friend of my mother but recently gave the job to his own mom. Most of my coworkers have been here for over a decade and I'm the only one under 30.


Now, i've been wanting to leave for a while now because this job stresses me out and it's hard on my anxiety. I know every job has it's problem but this one is just too much.

New management is also very poor, I get she's starting, but after a month she's still incapable of doing the basics. The shop is now a mess, we're missing a lot of products, schedules are all over the place etc.

The last problem is that we can't keep new employees and as time goes on, people quit. There's less and less staff and we get a whole lot of hours. For instance, i asked for about 25h/week and I've done an average of 32 in the last couple weeks. Some had to 60+ hours a week.


So here comes my problem, I quit yesterday and gave my notice. My boss said nothing, but when I came in to work this morning there was nothing but complaining. My coworkers were whining about how many hours they would have to do when I leave and one tried to change my mind. I was even told that if I stayed I might get promoted. I'm starting to feel bad for them, especially since 3 of the 10 employees left are planning on leaving in the next month or so. We also had to start closing at night from lack of staff.


I feel like i'm putting everyone else in trouble and betraying them just because i'm tired of this job, especially since i've known them for a while and me leaving puts more work on everyone else.


TL,DR: I quit the job I hate and i'm putting everyone else in a bad spot because of it.

bycptf	2019-06-08 21:20:02	TypicalVegetarian	AITA for being annoyed with my sister for yelling at me for money concerns?	"So I have had a complicated last few months. I had a great job in the US and then sold almost everything I own to move to a new country. My sister ended up moving from NY to another state where she would need a car to get to work. I had a fully paid off car as is and figured it was perfect timing so I gave it to her, along with about $1,000 worth of kitchen stuff, and my beloved Nintendo Switch and a few games which I told her she could sell to make money.

She didn't say thank you or some verbally appreciative of it when I gave her it all but she's not a vocally supportive person to begin with so I just let it slide. Well, after a few months abroad, I had to return home for medical reasons and moved to the state she did as well since we have a ton of family here and I want to be around family. She offered to let me stay at her place while I get a job and I obliged as we've always been really close.

Everything was fine until about two weeks ago. She had helped cover some of my expenses like 2 dinners, and a little things like towels and garbage cans.... stuff to fill out my room and everything! Totalling about $175 more or less. I figured I'd ""add it to my tab"" and just pay her back once I got a job. Now I've had a ton of interviews and have one offer from a great company right now, am expecting to receive a better offer on Monday, and am in the process of interviewing for my dream position that would see me earning nearly 6 figures at a pretty young age. So naturally, I want to keep interviewing and get that job.

However, she said we should get a new couch for the new place we were moving into and found a great deal on Facebook for a couch worth $300. I said hell yeah, great deal let's do it. I didn't realize that because I wanted a new couch, that meant I had to pay for the entire thing, thought we'd split the cost.

So she has been hassling me about money and telling me to just accept one of my current offers and not go for the dream job because I wouldn't start working it, for at least 20 days or so and she wants to be paid back now. I think this is ridiculous because the sheer difference in how much more money this is just makes sense to at least go for. Mind you, the offers I have don't have to be responded to until the 26th of this month.... meaning I have time to make a decision and interview.

Apologies for the wall of text but I wanted to get all of the objective facts out there. So in short:

I gave her a fully paid off car
$1,000 worth of Kitchen Stuff
A Nintendo Switch she sold for $300

She's given me a place to stay for a month so far (not rent-free, I paid my half)

Covered the cost of a couch

Paid for some of my meals

Has chastised me dozens of times over beign stressed about money, seemingly blind to the fact that I gave her a car, and made it so she didn't have to spend hundreds on anything for a kitchen.

I didn't know she left until I got out of the shower, searched the house to find her, texted her, and then called her because I didn't recieve a response. When she got back I got mad at her and said told her why. She didnt tell me she was leaving or where she was going. She thinks I'm overreacting but I really don't feel like that. I told her that her not telling me is bad because if something happens how am I supposed to even help if I don't know where she went or even what direction she was going.

bycmus	2019-06-08 21:12:11	CP3deservesaring	AITA for not being friends with someone I used to like (and still have feelings for)?	"So I (M 19) had been into this girl (F 19) I had met online on a Discord chat last summer, which before you start kicking my ass, we were both headed to the same University. We had talked nearly every day since like May up until September, when school was about to begin. There was this pre-college camping trip that we went to, but we ended up in different groups. Both her and I had never been in a relationship before, and on the camping trip, each person in your group is supposed to talk about themselves and how their path ended up bringing them to this university. Evidently, this girl’s group probably told her that I wasn’t worth it especially since we had only really met online before. Which makes sense if you think about it, but when I asked her to dance after the camping trip not only did she say she was dancing with her new friends, one of them told me to “chill” multiple times. It took all of me not to fight this dude, but I left in shame and ranted about it to her later, and she didn’t take a side. I said that she had a lot to think about and stopped talking to her.

Anyways, fast forward to the end of our first year, and she had hinted that she thought about what I had told her a lot, regretted making those friends that she never talks to anymore, and wanted to be friends. She’s currently dating someone that I don’t know, but I know she is although she didn’t mention him at all when we hung out. Spending those two hours with her, which after the end she opened her arms for a hug, and I held her for so long that she said “wow you really missed me”, which I replied “just a little bit” before leaving, made me so so happy for the rest of the day, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I still liked her but not as a friend.

The following morning, I texted her and she replied immediately. It was fine but then I said, I just don’t think our friendship is sustainable because of how much I liked you and how I can’t separate feeling absolutely wonderful being around you but at the same time you broke my heart and I can’t separate the two. She replied it’s fine and do what you got to do. I left her on read after that. Did I do the right thing? Or should I have given the friendship a chance and am an asshole because I didn’t?

TL,DR: liked a girl who I had never met before who kinda ditched me for some new friends, later regretted and wanted to be friends with me again, to which I agreed to hang out once before realizing it’s probably not worth it and told her so without giving her a chance because I was afraid of letting my feelings take over.

bycmp2	2019-06-08 21:11:48	AL3X4ND3R284	AITA For Kicking a friend from a group chat for spoiling Endgame?	"This is a Repost. The initial one I made was taken down for a misunderstanding of the previous title.

A Bit of backstory, and an obligatory spoiler alert.

I am a nerd who absolutely loves Marvel and what they have done with the MCU. I watch most theories and rumors about up and coming MCU and Fox films on YouTube so I tend to know what is happening in each film. However, I steered clear from anything that could remotely be considered spoilery for avengers endgame. I also made a mental note to stay off all social media platforms a week out from the release of the film date. One other thing I should add is that I have an incredible memory, for unimportant or bad events.

I have been talking about the movie for roughly a month with my friends on a group chat (also fellow nerds). Being the person who created the chat, I had the only admin abilities and didn't notice. All of us being nerds however meant we didn't really socialise much in high school, so we're all we have (sappy I know, but true nonetheless). I told them how much this movie means to me and how extremely excited I was for the movie, yet I would be constantly be berated by one of my friends. 

He would claim that I need to grow up and stop watching kids films, and that he hopes I hate the film and that the film is filled with screaming infants ect. This didn't really bother me because its not unlike him to act this way so I mostly ignored him. 

8 days before the film however, a photo was posted to the group chat, followed by a message 'oops'. I opened messenger to see Hulk holding an infinity gauntlet. The instant I knew what it was I turned off my phone, hoping I would forget it, unfortunately, my memory made me eternalise that image in the back of my head. This I knew was a spoiler and spoiled the first 2 acts of the film for me (I tend to theorise so I thought this outcome was possible, hence I had a pretty good idea what lead to this scene).

Luckily it was 4 in the morning and I was the first person on the chat to see it. so I entered a bunch of jargon into the chat so that it wasn't immediately loaded in for other to see, gave a spoiler warning, and … proceeded to kick him from the group.

I thought what I did was right given the circumstances. But after about an hour mostly everyone in the group was calling me an asshole and saying ""its not his fault you're offended about that, just grow up"" or something along those lines. I said id add him back after a week if it wasn't a spoiler, but that it might take longer to add him if it was real.

Now it seems like there is some kind of civil war between our group. Those that think he was a dick because this was the thing I was most excited for this year (which is big cause I start Uni in Canberra this year to study astrophysics (like I said I'm a nerd)), and those that think I'm a dick for kicking him from the group,  for essentially nothing. I still haven't forgiven him for his actions."	Asshole	0	0

bycmch	2019-06-08 21:10:51	Akinyx	AITA for getting mad at my bf for siding with his friend that used to harass me?	"
Not sure if my bf browses here but hi if you read this, feel free to comment I guess.
The initial situation happened a month or so ago but resurfaced recently only. My bf and I are ldr and young.

His friend (that he knows IRL) and I knew each other before I met my bf but we were never close. After me and my bf got closer he would just find any occasion to put me down as ""banter"" and I didn't think much of it until it became annoying : calling me names, mocking me, insulting me... The word ""thot"" came up a lot.
I talked about it with my bf on multiple occasions and he would sometimes tell his friend ""that's mean"" and nothing else.
This situation was just really childish imo but it turned into harassment with time and the fact that it didn't bother my boyfriend really hurt me.

I tried to take the matter privately and seriously by asking the guy to stop calling me names but he didn't care and I'll admit I didn't have the best attitude towards it although ignoring it didn't help at all. I decided I'd respond one day and well I was upset and became as childish as him. I asked if he had a problem with women (since he made sexist comments) and if he treated other women he knows that way, he said he didn't. My bf then added that he was afraid of talking to girls IRL so of course he didn't. I continued on that topic and he added that he did talk to a girl and was really close to her and that he didn't treat her that way. No one knew that girl even people close to him. So we asked about her and he wouldn't give any info. It just seemed fishy and we concluded that he was using that imaginary girl to prove he had nothing against women in particular and that he just had an incel type of attitude after I got with my bf. He got really mad and didn't speak to me after that.

After all my bf finally decided to step in for real but oh well, only after I could be blamed as well.
He talked to him privately and he apparently said that he didn't believe either of us were right. His friend apologized (but not to me directly) and said he wouldn't speak to me after what I've had done. My bf still sided with him but they didn't talk to each other until a few weeks ago. His friend avoided me and caused my bf to not be able to spend time with both of us and leaving me a lot of times alone (I don't have friends rip).

Today his friend wanted to join us and I really didn't take it well. My bf got mad at me for leaving and added that his friend didn't care about that situation anymore but I couldn't just accept it after everything he did. I asked him how he could be fine with the situation back then and also how he could be friends with the guy that would harass me. He said that it was because they were good friends.
I left and the conversation ended there, it's been hours since and I don't know what to do.

byckxh	2019-06-08 21:07:02	epic_meme_account	AITA if I told someone I liked them then friendzoned them?	"Background: Everyone in the story is in highschool. I'm a junior, and the girl (let's call her The Girl) is a senior. Both of us are the nerdy type. 

Story: Both of us were going to a school socializing party thing. As it was put on by the school, it wasn't really a wild party. However, when I'm tired I don't always think straight. And I was quite tired. I was also rather lonely at the time, as single people often are. So, on the bus ride back, I told The Girl that I liked her. Now, I didn't really know her that well; we had a couple mutual friends and therefore had eaten in the cafeteria together a couple of times. She immediately friendzoned me.

Now, two weeks later, there was a school football game we both happened to be at (I swear I wasn't stalking her). Two of my friends were talking to The Girl, and I got a little suspicious. I walked over to that side of the field, and the two conniving siblings left me and The Girl alone, immediately. We started talking, and she said she liked me. That really surprised me. However, I went with it. I did like her, I was just confused about why she changed her mind.

We started spending a lot more time together and all that stuff. Now, we talked about it and decided we didn't want to date. We both really care about our grades and colleges and all of that, so wanted to focus our attention on school. Or at least I thought. But then, she started treating our relationship as if I was her personal counselor. Every time she was depressed, I heard about it. Every time she needed a shoulder to lean on, I was there. Pretty much every night we would hang out, sitting together and talking pretty much all the time. Now, I know that I was in the wrong for leading her on a little. However, I was in way over my head. 

I didn't want to be her counselor, I just wanted to be friends. I don't have the emotional strength for my own emotions, let alone someone else's. One of my good friends (a girl btw) told me to end it. The catalyst was a slew of text messages from The Girl I got one night. She was looking to me to tell her that she was valued as a person, and wanted to take things farther. She was dropping hints about taking things beyond friendship and all that stuff. That overwhelmed me. Additionally, I was getting some other weird vibes from her. She was overly religious, and got really upset at any swearing. One other thing was that I was never sure if the whole thing was genuine. After all, she only told me she liked me after my friends talked to her.

So, I told her that I didn't want anything else to come of the relationship. I friendzoned her. She was miserable and stared at me from across the cafeteria for the next couple weeks. I didn't know what to do, so I left her alone. I responded to every text she sent me with one word responses and after a couple hours delay. She has stopped texting now. That's the story. AITA?"

Then things started to go south. I can‘t pinpoint the exact reason why, but I think it had to do with me rejecting his best friend and me and our other friends not being able to hang out with him as much due to school stress and introversion.

He became so hurt by this that he started being weird to us. Whenever we wouldn‘t wanna hang out with him he‘d harass us over the phone to ruin any fun we were having without him. He‘d call other people we were hanging out with to be mean to them. He‘s acting like we‘re five, and this whole behaviour makes us like him even less.

He also has the habit of buying tickets to concerts we‘re attending without asking us prior, and then driving us there. So he‘d be doing us a favour, being extremely nice to us for the evening, but we would still be feeling weird because nobody invited him in the first place.
Now he has heard us talking about an artist we NEED to see, we‘ve been fans forever and he bought us tickets. We were incredibly thankful and didn‘t buy them ourselves like we planned to.

Now he totally snapped. I can‘t go into detail, but there‘s stalking involved, he damaged a mutual friend‘s car and I‘m kinda scared every time he asks us to hang out.

We really want to see this artist. We haven‘t had much fun this year so far and we‘ve been looking forward to this event forever. We even worked on a present for the artist which we planned on giving him at that concert, but going there is impossible without those tickets as they‘re already sold out and our friends still has our tickets. 

Would I be the asshole if I stayed friends with this him until I got the tickets? I know he‘s an asshole, but wouldn‘t I be too for lying to him?

EDIT: We already paid him back for the tickets, so we‘re not expecting free stuff from him."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I gave him the details in advance and he changed the name of the account, which would cost £10 to change back. But then he decided he didn’t want the account and said he’d log out (which he didn’t, so he effectively tried to scam me but I saw that he played some games after he “logged” out, thinking I couldn’t see) . After I got him to log out I got pissed that if I were to change the name back it would cost me £10. 

I’m thinking of asking for £10 to change the name back but he might say I’m an asshole for asking for money when he didn’t even buy the account or that I’m not even playing it anymore so it doesn’t matter. But what if I get back into it?

bych0h	2019-06-08 20:56:12		AITA for spending 200k to have a biological child?	"This is a hard topic, and I know we're definitely looking at this emotionally, so it's probably good to get a 3rd party perspective. Some details changed/obscured for privacy.

My husband and I both come from religious families. We married fairly young, and tried to have a child soon after. After a few months of trying, I got a positive test. As it turns out, sometimes a positive test doesn't mean pregnancy. For me, it meant cancer. I had to get a hysterectomy, but I was able to keep one ovary. I went back on the pill to try to stave off chemical menopause 

This was devastating. We still very much wanted kids, but couldn't justify the cost of a surrogate and IVF when we could ""just adopt"" and use money for children that are already here. We didn't qualify for infant adoption, not that I really support it, so we tried foster care.

We've had two placements. One was a kinship placement that ended up reunifying after 2 years. This was hard, but that's part of foster care. The second placement was a little girl, removed for abuse. She was with us for almost 2 years. To say we bonded was an understatement. We were about to adopt, when at the 11th hour an aunt showed up. She promised that she'd block biomom, not let the trash boyfriend around, etc, etc. 

I would have and should have fought harder. We let ourselves believe that this would work out, that this was best. All those promises ended up failing, and that child has since passed away. This... broke us. We feel that adoption is no longer an option and we'll pay anything to get a child that CAN be kept safe, that CAN'T be taken away. 

We looked into donor embryos and donor egg, but with the cost of surrogacy it would ultimately be about the same price as creating our own, and we don't want any chances of anyone else being able to make a claim.

We're currently moving forward with this plan. All told, it will cost almost 200k. Our families still say that we're crazy and selfish, but I just don't think so. We tried to do good, and it almost broke us apart and as people too many times. If being ""obsessed with our DNA"" gets us to parenthood with the lowest risk possible, then that's what it has to be."

bycfd9	2019-06-08 20:51:35	Virging	AITA for telling my friend she can't afford her birthday dinner	"Context: I'm 19 and all of my friends are 19 as well. I've been friends with this girl (we will call her Sarah) for a very long time. Her parents are undocumented so they've always struggled financially. Sarah has her own job and she tends to use her own money very irresponsibly, such as paying people $100 to write her school papers for her. 

Sarah's birthday was a few days ago and we all met up at a mutual friends house (let's call her Sam) and Sarah brought some of her work friends along. She asked Sam to purchase them alcohol and she would pay her back. Sam bought the alcohol ($23) but didn't get paid back, so she's been asking Sarah for the money for the past few days but Sarah just kept saying she would send it (she does this often). 

Today, Sarah is supposed to have a birthday dinner (organized by another mutual friend) where everybody has to pay for themselves. Sam asked her for the money back because otherwise she can't pay for her own dinner tonight. Sarah said ""I don't know how much money I'll have left, I still have to buy myself a dress for tonight."" After hassling her, Sam got her money back and Sarah said ""good luck eating with $23"". They picked a pretty expensive restaurant in downtown that would cost about $40 per person (this is expensive to 19 year olds who barely have jobs). Sarah isn't even paying for herself because she doesn't have money; her friend who organized the dinner is paying for her. They kept telling us to come dressed up nicely and ""not in jeans"". 

After mutual agreement with me and my friends, we decided to tell them in the group chat that the place they picked is actually expensive. They told us ""okay listen if it's too much then you don't have to come. Like honestly. Sarah just wanted a nice fancy dinner"" with attitude to which I replied ""she can't even afford the dinner herself, what makes you think we can"". My friends collectively decided not to go at all and then Sarah messaged me privately telling me not to come and calling us all bad friends and she even cried and cancelled the dinner saying this is why she can never do anything for her birthday. I was going to drive to the restaurant initially and Sarah expected me to pick them up and get valet parking (she has no money for valet parking).

I asked her why of which the answer was that she had asked her friend 13 times today if she wanted to do something with her (my gf).

I must admit my first thought wasn't how rude it seemed that someone made my gf ask 13 bloody times without answering... But that it seemed a bit excessive to ask 13 times in one day to ask someone whether they wanted to do something together or not.

I ask her if her friend implied that she wanted to do something later. The answer was no.

She went on about how her friend behaved the last few days and about how her friend asked whether or not they (a group of 3) would like to meet next week... That plan fell short because only Monday would go and neither her friend nor her other friend thought it to be a good idea.
And that today her friend was always busy either binge watching a series or playing with others (which my gf disliked to hear because she wanted to play too)

I told my gf that in this case I don't see what her friend did to deserve being fed up with.
I said i do understand that it sucks for her (gf) but that her friend has no obligation to spend time with her and maybe just didn't want to spend time with her rn. That she didn't lead her on and just stated the fact that she was busy rn.

My gf said she didn't deserve this from me and that she got it.

Now she doesn't want to talk to me which is fine as i do understand that she is upset and wanted my support and not my opinion.

But i feel that i owe her to be truthful with her, even if it hurts or she dislikes it. I expect the same.

Anyways, I dated a guy for a year that brought me back this mug from the states shaped as a shark, handle was a fin (semi-expensive mug, I looked into buying another one). I LOVE sharks more than anything, so this was the perfect gift. This mug was so perfect that I would never use it for coffee because coffee wasn’t worthy of this mug. 

When we broke up, despite my love for the shark mug, I put it in the “box of stuff” you give back to your ex, thinking it would bring back too many memories. Now, a year later I’m happily with someone else and these memories are no longer. I basically just want my favourite mug back. 

My roommate who is newly single is on tinder happened to match with my ex, I explained the mug story and now we’ve made it a mission for her to go over there, hookup with him, and take the mug in the morning. To be fair, he’s only looking for the hook up as he has stated in his profile, so no emotional sabotage.

Edit: to be fair, she was already planning on hooking up with him anyways, I just told her to comment on the mug if she saw it to be funny, she said she would just get it back.

Update: I know you all desperately want this edit. He’s invited her over to check out his new place when he’s done moving (with a wink at the end of course). So progress, unpack kitchen essentials and chill anyone?

EMERGENCY UPDATE: the ex and my roommate are still talking, but now my ex’s roommate has also matched with her on tinder and is asking her to come over (same house). This plot twist is fucking unreal.

byc8vo	2019-06-08 20:33:17		AITA for telling my friend’s parents about his drug habit?	"So this is a while back, we were 16. I had been best friends with this guy since we were 8. Due to problems (depression, anxiety etc) he became desperate. As we finished high school, we all did weed for the first time. It was fun and we did it responsibly, and most of the people involved ended it there. However, this friend and a few others found solace in the feeling it gave them. Be it a lack of anxiety or a rush of adrenaline that their life lacked, this substance took a firm grip on their lives.

A couple months down the line my once best mate has mingled with other people who are drip feeding him weed and he has taken up casual smoking. Though i was worried for him and upset that he had started speaking to me less, i noticed that he was happy. It didn't seem to be doing any immediate harm so i let it go.

Come December i make my way into college and notice him and a few friends laughing. When i investigated, my friend pulled out a small baggy containing MDMA. It was the first time i ever saw a class A drug and due to my age and inexperience i was shocked. What dark hole was my friend going down? 

I decide to drop it as i know people sometimes just have to experiment to learn their limits. That is until a month later i see him on someones Snapchat story doing lines of ketamine off the back of an iPhone. MDMA, Ketamine, coke, LSD, so much weed. Some of them he did at the same time, which i knew was deadly.

My friend who had stood by me for so many years, who was their when i needed help, seemed lost. I managed to catch him alone, and I said, ""what the fuck are you doing?"", ""you're throwing your life away"" etc. But he just shrugged it off and told me to mind my own business. I could tell by the way he spoke, the way he looked, his blasé attitude to everything he did, he was fucked up.

I made a decision. He needed help, and i had to tell his parents. They are good people and i know they'd do whatever they could to help him. I knew he'd hate me. I knew i might get hurt. But i also knew that if he were to die, it would be my fault. I saw this as the only thing i could do.

The mother was upset, the father angry. I'm sure they didn't hurt him, but i know they were a broken family for quite some time. Eventually though, through therapy, and an amazing girlfriend, he managed to escape that life. 

Luckily for me he saw my side of the argument and thanked me. I was never hurt but it was not fun.

A few years down the line now, my friend is fine, completely drug free. When i think back to it, knowing what i know now, i thought back to my intentions and i couldn't help but think; was what i did a selfish act, to try to take a back a friend which i lost to another friend group? Was i salty that someone i had known for so long had stopped talking to me? So much so that i was willing to risk the happiness of his family and relationships? But more importantly, am i the asshole?"		1	0

"So, my wife FB posted a cartoon showing a male and a female hanging out on a couch (presumably partners who have kids) and it has the man (presumably a working husband) asking “did you call the plumber? What did you do all day?” And shows the female (presumably a SAHM) saying “no I didn’t have a chance, and I don’t know what I did all day” and then in a separate thought bubble lists like 25 things including all the housework and all the stuff she did with the kids, and not showering etc etc. 

https://imgur.com/a/6G4ZVPY

My perception of it is that the dude is basically clueless to how difficult his partner’s day is and how hard she works. Which isn’t me. In the least.  I felt working dad-shamed and I got upset with her about it.

Also pertinent info is that we are currently working through issues where my wife doesn’t think I contribute enough and I’ve been going into overdrive to go above and beyond what I normally do lately, all the while working 70+ hours a week at a very challenging and sleep-deprived job.  

I am extremely active in doing things with and for the kids when I’m home, handle most of the cleaning, take care of all the finances, do most of the grocery shopping, all the cooking when I am home, all the car and home maintenance. She has also made it clear that she does not especially enjoy being a SAHM, as she left her career to do it (completely her decision).

Am I the asshole here?

EDIT: corrected imgur link

EDIT: I may have left out a crucial bit of info. We have been in counseling for almost 6 months. And much of what we discuss is how I’m not “present” (mostly because i work 24 hour shifts that sometimes last 48 hours) and she feels overburdened."	Not the A-hole	0	0

byc4cb	2019-06-08 20:20:36		AITA for letting my 8th-grade daughter exclude one member of her social group from a birthday party?	"My daughter is in 8th grade and about to finish middle school. She is part of a pretty close-knit group of 9 girls who have been together since 5th or 6th grade. They are all basically friends, although as with any group of 9 middle schoolers, there is always some drama, and each of the girls is not necessarily best friends with all of the others. In particular, there is one girl that my daughter does not really like all that much -- we'll call her Alice. Alice is sometimes something of a bully, tends to stir up more in-group drama than just about anyone else, and tries to police everyone's friendships with other girls who are not part of the group. But some of other girls in the group like her, and they've all somehow been able to make it work for the last several years. 

My daughter has an up-coming birthday party. She wants to do something like a group manicure and/or a pizza party and maybe a sleepover/movie night for the group -- minus Alice. She doesn't care that much for Alice's behavior/personality and feels that she'll have a better time if Alice isn't there. 

I think it's her party and she's within her rights to invite who she wants. If she doesn't want Alice to come, it's fine with me. [We have discussed that this could cause some social fallout, but it's the end of middle school and they all seem somewhat sick of each other so she doesn't seem to care about that.] 

My wife, on the other hand, thinks it' a ""dick move"" to have a party for all of the girls but not invite Alice. Even if my daughter doesn't really want her there, my wife feels that it's just too harsh to single her out and exclude her. 

Are I and my daughter assholes for thinking it's ok to not invite Alice?"	No A-holes here	1	0

So i live next to an arroyo - a canal for flood waters - with a bridge next to me. There is a bike path paved next to the arroyo so its got people travelling through it at all times of the day.  \[image for reference\]([https://i.imgur.com/ecqYXMP.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ecqYXMP.jpg)) A homeless person has been living under the bridge  for about a year or so. I didn't mind it since the guy kept to himself and cleaned up after himself.

 That is until recently when a second person showed up. Lately they've been hanging out behind our house -where there is a second canal- late at night (10-2AM) where we can hear them talking. If i go outside between 11-3 AM i can hear them talking pretty loudly and they''ll alternate from under the bridge to behind my house.

A few days ago we had put some couches on the sidewalk inf front of the street to get picked up as we had recently got some new ones. I guess they asked my grandma who lives with us if they could have them and she said yes. Little did she know these guys lived under the bridge. So they moved the two couches under the bridge. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday put me over the edge. Around 9 or 10 PM i heard my dog barking on our neighbors side of the house . We had put some broken plastic chairs  on the side of our house to get thrown away. Two of these chairs were gone and my side gate was open. My cousin that lived with us said that when she went to investigate she saw four guys split - two to the arroyo and two up the street. As far as i can tell only the chairs are missing. This morning i looked under the bridge and saw the broken chairs discarded in the river bed.

I was visiting my grandparents house. I had a mosquito bite on my leg that wasn’t going away, and my grandpa (who was a retired doctor) gave me an antibiotic pill.. from his own medication... medication that he says he “self prescribed” to himself, and seeing as they keep 30-year-old ingredients in filthy conditions all the time I didn’t want to know how old it was or where it’d been... My grandma even told me it ‘probably isn’t good for you’ behind his back with a happy wink then shuffled off. To a teenager who knows jack about meds.

I was obliviously trusting of them despite all of that and took the pill anyway. Grandpa tells me it’s a prescription and I’ll have to take more for like a month. Okay, fine, you’re the doctor person, you know more than me.

I mention this to my brother and he flips, tells me not to take any more, that it was from grandpa’s medication and really not for a bug bite, don’t trust grandpa, etc etc. I get scared and hide the second pill grandpa already gave me.

My dad asks me later if I took the pill, I decide to be honest and say no. He flips and tells me I’m being very disrespectful and that I’ll get really sick if I don’t take it. He and my grandparents (including my grandma??) all berate me to take the pill but I refuse and refuse. I decide to call my mom who basically says to me and my dad that I’ll start a prescription when I get back home. I’m on the verge of tears during all this because my dad never yells at me and his parents were right along with him saying I’ll get super sick and the bite will get infected if I don’t take grandpa’s pills.

I get home, my mom never gets me a prescription, the bug bite goes away like a week after (I’m pretty sure the only reason it was there so long was because I was scratching it). 

My dad made me feel awful about not trusting my grandpa, but on the other hand I feel like grandpa was genuinely trying to help me and I was rude to him by not trusting his judgement.

bybxda	2019-06-08 20:01:40	Phariseus	AITA for not wanting to participate in our for-profit, limited liability company's fundraising events with my own money?	"""George, I have noticed you hadn't bought a single raffle ticket yet. Go on, they're only a pound, for a chance to win 50!"", my manager asked me today.

""Oh. It's because I don't approve of gambling, Sarah"", I responded, as it was the first excuse that popped into my mind. I thought it would be enough for her not to push the subject any further. I was wrong.

""It's not gambling! It's a raffle! The remainder of the money raised goes into the Resident Support Fund. It directly benefits our home's Residents"", the manager replied.

Let's pause for a bit. Our company owns about 40 nursing homes across England. It's an LTD, so the financial statements are not a secret. Last year, they reported a profit of over £2.5M. Yet about 80% of our staff, especially the carers, are making just a fraction above national minimum wage. If you're not a manager on a contract, there's no bonuses. The staff are charged for everything - from uniforms to lunches.

Being a resident of a nursing home isn't cheap either. It costs more per week than I make in a month.

And what is the Resident Support Fund? Sometimes we throw parties, sometimes we get a new telly for the lounge, sometimes we do some re-furbishing. Pretty much standard business costs in the care industry that should be covered with our Clients' hard-earned money. Yet apparently they aren't - and we need to supplement it. But she must've known all that. So instead of trying the reasonable approach, this is what came out of my mouth:

""That's nice. I wish Sainsbury's employees had a Shopper Support Fund. Why don't they all chip in? Don't they realise it would directly benefit us, the paying customers?"" - I realised how passive-aggressive and stand-offish it sounded the second I responded. Sarcasm is the default dialogue option for a Brit. Its how communicate, but I fully own the fact that it could've been perceived as uncalled for.

Suffice to say, Sarah wasn't pleased. Other people overheard my apparent insubordination. Monday week, I have a meeting with her, the deputy and the HR lady. I highly doubt the meeting is going to be about the ethical quandaries of pressuring low-paid staff into giving back the money to their employer. I have a feeling it's going to be about ""teamwork"", ""going the extra mile"", ""charity"", ""work spirit"" and ""we're all in this together"".

Obviously, that's just my point of view. I haven't got the faintest clue how it looked from the manager's perspective. She's the one that has to answer to the Regional Manager and the CEO, after all.

Feel free to ask anything. Don't know if it matters, but I'm 30, male, and I'm the Social Activities Conductor. Arts n Crafts, Bingo, quizzes, outings, booking entertainers, throwing b-day parties, doing the newsletter, that sort of thing (I have a separate budget for all that). It's not about the money. It's a matter of principle.

bybu7s	2019-06-08 19:52:52	UntakenUsernameTaken	AITA for wanting to be able to hear	"The title probably sounds idiotic, but it is the simplest way to sum it up.

Quick information: 
1. I am hearing impaired, as the only one in my family, everyone including my sister is of normal hearing.

2. The acoustics of our living room caused the sound in the corner where my seat is to be objectively cleare/better. 

3. Wearing my hearing aids for long periods give me headaches, think unable to move or talk bad.

The situation:

My family and I had just come home from a long family gathering, meaning I, had been wearing my hearing aids for eight hours, we had agreed earlier to watch HP when we came home.

Everything was well good and well, until we had to sit down, and my younger sister sat in my spot, low-key annoyed I asked her if she could move, signalling to the mostly empty couch.

My mother heard this, and told me I could just move somewhere else, I turned around and explained to her that I had a minor headache honestly didn't feel like sitting somewhere else right now.

She had a whole monologue about how I couldn't just demand to always sit there, and was it really so terrible having to wear my hearing aids for another hour and a half.

Slightly pissed, I examined that I already had a minor headache and didn't feel like laying in my bed all day tomorrow, this resulted in a second, somehow longer monologue about family and if it was really worth it jepoardizing a family evening due to a headache.

My family, agreed with this, and that I should not demand that my sister moved for my own gain, what would I gain from sitting there? The ability to hear more than sixty percent of the movie, somehow they made it seem like I had some grand evil plan by making my sister move.

So there’s a friend I work with, I see every day without fail. She’s named her cat Ginny* (*not real name). What a lovely name. Except I named MY OWN BABY that. Literally only 7 months ago. And she knows. They’ve met. It was in the newsletter for our place of work with a photo included. 

I’m probably not going to do anything or say anything (suggestions welcome!) but AITA to be very annoyed and angry that she’s given her cat THE SAME NAME as my new born baby?

EDIT: ok so IATA. I’m no longer annoyed. I guess I just needed to vent about it. She can use whatever name she wants, and she’s already had people asking if she “got the name from fat_mummy”. At the end of the day, my little girl is absolutely gorgeous and suits her name to a T. I guess I was annoyed as I picked it because it is uncommon and the last thing I expected was a cat being called it haha!"	No A-holes here	0	0

bybsp6	2019-06-08 19:48:34	purplegardien	AITA for wearing high heels as a tall woman at someone’s wedding.	"Yesterday, I attended the wedding of my boyfriend’s former piano tutor as his plus one. The wedding was quite fancy and everyone was in formal wear for the ceremony and reception, which were held inside a chateau.

I am 21 and quite tall for a woman at 5’11. I am also a model. My boyfriend is also tall at 6’5. We usually get stares when we are together, I suppose mainly because of our height. 

For the wedding, I wore a long gown which was in accordance with the dress code. I also wore 3.5 inch heels with my gown. I didn’t think that was unusual...nearly every female was wearing heels at the wedding.

At the wedding, my boyfriend and I got some stares, but of course the main attention was focused on the bride, who was beautiful. 

About 20 minutes before the ceremony began, the mother of the bride came over to me and politely asked if I could remove my heels and offered a pair of flats that belonged to the maid of honour. She said that my height was “distracting” and she was afraid that I’d block the view of those sitting in the back rows (my BF and I were sitting somewhere in the middle). I thought it was an odd request because my BF is next to me and he’s half a foot taller than me...should he crouch down? But I didn’t want to argue with the mother of the bride. I wore my own pair of flats that I had brought. She said thank you and left.

After the ceremony, I thought this meant I could wear my heels again. But apparently not, because when I walked into the reception area the mother of the bride looked disapprovingly at me. She did not come to talk to me but it was obvious that she was annoyed.

I found this whole thing very odd. I was a very polite guest, I wore a modest dress and makeup, nothing over the top.  Yes, I wore heels that made me over 6ft but I cannot help my height, and besides, all the other female guests were in heels. Granted I was the tallest woman among the 100 or so guests, but still. My boyfriend found it rude of the mother of the bride, but didn’t say anything.

I really did not wish to cause any problems though. Should I have worn my flats for the duration of the wedding, including the reception to minimize distractions from the bride? Or is the MOB overreacting? Thank you."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Amount was 2K total, so enough to cover about a semester + books. I was not familiar with the organization prior to this, but several members somewhat strong-armed me into going to a couple meetings and I ended up being quite involved for about 2 years until I transferred schools. 
Fastforward 3 years and I have just graduated with my bachelor’s and recently started working full-time. Somehow one of the members from before found out, and keep contacting me to re-join the organization as an adult member. This is a very philantrophic organization and takes a considerable amount of financial commitment & time. I really have no interest is returning to this group, seeing that i’ve been scraping by up until recently (working and paying the remaining entirety of my 4 years’ tuition), and am trying to save up now so I can move out on my own. I am getting the feeling this member feels like I owe them my involvement as repayment for the scholarship,which seriously rubs me the wrong way. AITA for ignoring their calls?

bybq7y	2019-06-08 19:42:01	FlashTuttles	AITA for snagging a bunch of food at events, work places, etc.	"For me, I've been taught to get my ""money's worth"", such as asking for ketchup packets, napkins, plastic utensils, etc.. nothing too un-ordinary.

&#x200B;

So- my High School hosts an all night party for senior graduates- 10-5am at a Dave and Busters (unlimited free games, 250 credits, hypnotist, mechanical bull, ice cream bar, unlimited food for dinner and breakfast, but nothing so fancy)

Costed $100 in total, which I already paid for, but it wasn't something that I was bothered with a bunch by the cost.

&#x200B;

Knowing that I was going to a place serving a plethora food, and it was an all night party, I decided it was a good idea to bring some gallon zip block bags for later consumption, mainly the next day or whatnot. It was food that I wouldn't get to eat often, such as sliders, mini-pizzas, pretzel poppers, and mini-chicken tenders. They also had a cookie, brownie slices, and fruit tray. I first got a normal plate of food for actual dinner consumption. Afterwards, though, I would end up getting a gigantic plate of food and then stuffed them in a gallon zip block bag. Rinse and repeat when it came to breakfast with bagels and muffins. I mostly did this when everyone got what they wanted to get and it was at the end of the serving time. I think a chaperone did yell at me for taking too many bagels, so I put a few back and took some.

At the end of the day, I ended up with a whole nike drawstring bag of food, and even though I felt pretty guilty about it because a chaperone yelled at me about it but, I still took the food home and it lasted for around a week or so. (It would probably be gone in 4 days if I all ate it constantly for breakfast, lunch, dinner)

&#x200B;

Honestly, I am probably being really greedy with food, and I should probably limit to what I should take. For most of it, I understand that sanitary is a large issue when it comes to restaurants such as with my workplace and high school party. If there are leftovers, it goes into the trash because it is considered cold or whatnot. Most restaurants operate in that fashion of not saving food / no reheat. I always allow others to have the opportunity to get food before I start snagging it- and usually I don't snag everything there is, but a large portion once others are done. Say there is a tray of food. After I see everyone has eaten and there is still 2/4th food left, I think I would take around 1/4ths maybe. I've always had a thing for food not being wasted, but I could still see it just being me and ruining it for everyone by taking a bunch of the food.

&#x200B;

More on so, I guess it is my own decency that I should be worried about for myself rather than if I am being an a-hole or not. I'm probably looking for some advice, but I think it is more self- explanatory as to be decent and not take food. Maybe it is just understandable.. like a ""gentleman's clause""."	Asshole	0	0
bybp7r	2019-06-08 19:39:16	InfamousMastodon	WIBTA if I cared more about my cat than my dad's wedding?	"My parents divorced when I was 18, right before I left for college. My dad has been having a relationship with another woman since I was \~13-14, continuing even after my mom found out and he promised to stop. Understandably, my mom still pretty much hates him. I currently live with my mom and have a better relationship with her than with my dad, but I get along with my dad well enough too. He’s still seeing the same woman. Now, about 8 years after the divorce, my dad and his partner are going to get married. 

I can’t stand this woman. I have nothing in common with her and find her obnoxious. I always try to be polite and cordial with her, because the divorce wasn’t wholly her fault and realistically I only dislike her because of the circumstances, but I genuinely dislike spending time with her and I’m sure she and my father can tell. 

I’ve been invited to their wedding and would be taking part in the ceremony. I don’t want to go - apart from not liking his fiancee and her family, I’m a true introvert and hate large gatherings of any kind - but I would suck it up and attend for his sake if it wasn’t for one thing. 

The wedding is on a major holiday weekend, meaning my mom, an avid traveler, will be out of town. That would leave no one at our shared home to look after our cat for 3-4 days. This cat is my best friend. Maybe that’s silly, but it’s true, and his happiness and wellbeing is very important to me. He’s a former abandoned stray and extremely anxious - hates other animals, hates being transported in his carrier, hates loud and unfamiliar noises, hates when we leave him alone in the house for more than a few hours. I can’t kennel him, it would traumatize him. My mom is very neurotic about having strangers in the house and refuses to even consider a pet sitter we don’t know personally. Neither of us have many friends or relatives to ask, and we can’t come up with anyone we know to watch him. Leaving him alone would be negligent, boarding him would be cruel, hiring someone is off the table and I can’t ask my mom to sacrifice one of her rare vacations to spare the feelings of the ex-husband she hates. I just don’t see what the good option is. 

I floated the problem by my dad and while he didn’t state it outright, I can tell he’s either offended or hurt. He implied that I’m too sensitive and worry too much about my cat. Maybe that’s true, I worry too much about a lot of things. He also insinuated that staying home would be less for the cat’s sake and more about me ‘punishing’ him and my dislike for his fiancee. I’d like to think that’s not true, since I am genuinely worried about my cat, but I can see why he would feel that way. It would be like saying I care more about my cat being comfortable for a few days than his major life event. WIBTA if that were true?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
byboyj	2019-06-08 19:38:35		Aita for not letting my divorced mom to charge at my divorced dad's home charger?	"Sorry mobile format. My whole family drives EVs now. My mom and I drive the same ev, but I'm constantly driving between her house and my house bc the custodial agreement for me to see both like this. I also drive like 60ish miles on the regular to visit the college I'm attending this fall to drop off papers and wander. My dad is also constantly taking trips about the same distance as my college drive to hit up girls in down town, maybe to a prostitute, etc. All that bring said, my dad and I charge at our home charger that's powered by our solar panels with not a huge solar power battery bc they were installed a really long time ago. So when my dad and I both come back from a 60 mi one way drive and both our batteries are too low to go to school/work one way, we have to take turns charging at night on our medium speed charger. When my mom visits dad's house like fucking daily because she's a helicopter parent, she always asks to let her charge her car because her apartment doesn't have a private charger. However, she can get free charging from the nearby college parking lot (like a 3 min walk) after school hours, so like 8-10 pm. Any earlier, and she might get a ticket for not being a student or have to pay the $5 parking fee for guests. My dad makes great money and gets some $ back from the power company because we contribute to the neighbor's electricity, but since our battery is way older than our transition to EVs, we draw quite a bit of electricity from the real grid at night. Anyways, my mom asked me to let her drive around my car to do errands (she always uses mine when she's charging) and she wanted to go to her house and pick something up and bring it back to dad's house so she could monitor me and make sure in doing only homework. I just said no, take your own car and charge at the college because she definitely had enough miles to get home (about 10 miles home and she had 35 miles of charge). And she got really mad and said the usual asian parent ""is this the way you treat your mother?"" And I just keep saying I don't want her to leech off dad's electricity. Even though it's not very expensive and he hasn't said anything on it, it's just not the right thing to do. So she went blitz mad about how she doesn't have time and she needs to go back home otherwise she's just monitering me and doing nothing, and I responded that maybe she just doesn't have to monitor me???it's SUMMER?? and then she said if I was going to treat her that way then I have to pay this $36 parking ticket I gave to her to pay (I don't have any allowance and my dad is already paying for all my college) that was due over a month ago and has definitely increased in price. It's not like my dad minds her that much taking our electricity, but I just think it's morally wrong. WBU?

Tldr; one divorced parent is charging her ev at other divorced parent's home charger, and I think it's wrong of her to do it even though the charger's owner has stayed silent on this issue."	Asshole	1	0
byboxc	2019-06-08 19:38:28	octopusgas14	AITA for calling out a rude couple on the train and then not telling them that they left their bags behind	"I was on the train between 2 major cities, it’s a 1.5 hour journey so obviously most people want a seat. If you buy tickets in advance you get given a seat reservation, but if you buy them at the station you don’t and you may have to stand if there’s no seats available. I’d booked a seat so I was all good. Usually when you get on the train there are little screens above each seat which say if they’re reserved but they weren’t working that day, and reservations still apply even if the signs are broken. 

Anyway, I’m on the train and this couple who’d been out shopping (had loads of bags from clothes shops) got on and sat down. A few mins later some people get on and politely ask this couple to move as they’re sitting in their reserved seats. Usually people just accept this and get up and move because they know they haven’t booked, but the guy from the couple asked to see this persons ticket to make sure it was actually their seat (wtf, who made you the ticket inspector) anyway, it was their seat and so reluctantly the couple move to some other free seats opposite myself and my partner. 

The train was filling up pretty quickly and I realised it was gonna be full, it was 5pm on a weekday so lots of commuters. A lady and her son come along, looking confused as there were people sitting in their reserved seats (this couple), they were clearly tourists so couldn’t really speak english and weren’t sure of the etiquette of how to ask for their seats. Eventually they realised that their seats were taken and so asked the couple to move, again this guy gets all rude like ffs, and asks to see their tickets. At this point everyone on the train is watching. The couple are complaining and swearing under their breath whilst getting up. The kid is just standing in the aisle looking awkward not really knowing what to do (standing a bit in the way of this guy but not massively)  and then:

HIM (rude guy to kid):  are you gonna fucking move then so I can get up

 This kid is literally like 9 years old

So I told the guy: you don’t need to be so rude

HIM: what did you just say to me

ME: I said you didn’t need to be so rude. He’s only a child and you were in his seat anyway

HIM: Oh for gods sake (walks off in a huff with his girlfriend)

They left all their shopping bags under the table and to be honest, although we noticed we didn’t say anything because he was being a dick.

When I told all this to my friend later she said that even though they were being rude it was bad of us to not tell them that they left their bags. Well I didn’t really feel like walking off after him after he was speaking to people like that so nah I wasn’t gonna tell him - karma for being an asshole.

Now my grandmother not her grandmother mine organized this mass for my wife without asking me and invited  her family. So WIBTA?

Edit: I will be going, to show respect for mine and her family's beliefs and to show respect for the gesture. I never actually intended not to go just wondering if I would be the asshole? Thank you.

Edit 2 : I attended the mass. My wife's family did not attend, just my family. I would have felt like an asshole if I didnt show because I wasnt made aware until middle of mass that I had to carry the eucharist up. Aside from feeling awkward and out of place it went well. I'm sure I could have come up with a better way to honor my wife while honoring her beliefs. I still feel disrespected to a point because after the mass my grandmother told me ""Now She* is one step closer to heaven""  and I didnt even know how to respond. I honestly was not expecting that and I'm not sure exactly how I feel about it. I'll have to let it settle.

He’s type 2 diabetic with heart disease, a history of cardiac arrests, a triple bypass and has multiple stents. I’m an only child, and my mom who is also 67 has breast cancer, but takes better care of herself than my dad.

All my life, my dad has had a very sedentary lifestyle. He was a gymnast and athlete when he was young, but since I’ve been alive, he’s always been a couch potato. He enjoyed every type of food without considering the consequences. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve had to escort him to the ER a few times and see him struggle to recover after his surgeries. I started to be more health conscious in my own life, eating healthier and exercising. I encouraged him to start a vegan diet in hopes that he would cut some of the cholesterol and fat out of his diet, but it seems like he’s just a junk food vegan, constantly eating frozen processed meals and snacks. On top of that, he’s recently started to get shooting arthritis pains in his lower back and left shoulder, and uses that as an excuse not to walk, ever. When I try to take him out for a walk, he leans heavily on me and is out of breath after walking only 40 feet or so. It absolutely kills me inside because my dad has always been my best friend.

I don’t know why, but in the past few months I’ve been super resentful and angry about this situation. I feel utterly helpless because he doesn’t take my advice about eating better or walking in his spare time. I understand that it’s a vicious circle with the arthritis and I probably wouldn’t want to walk if I became short of breath and had sharp pains, too, but somethings gotta give.

I feel like my dad just gave up on himself and I don’t know how to stop feeling like it’s up to me to save him. I find myself freaking out when I see him buying Oreos and potato chips and sitting and watching tv every day. He drives for Uber 6 days a week so that’s obviously tiring, as well.

byblim	2019-06-08 19:29:22		AITA for turning down a roommate, after previously agreeing to room with her, upon learning about her religious rules?	"I respect everyone's religious beliefs and practices. I, myself, am not a religious person though.

I'm Jewish by ethnicity, and some people think that means I'm Orthodox. I'm not Orthodox though. I am literally eating Subway as I write this on my laptop on Saturday.

Orthodox practices - like keeping kosher, separating dishes, electronics on Saturday, etc - are too much for me. Not to mention Passover and Rosh Hashana.

When someone asked me last month if I would room with her, it seemed like a really good idea. Yesterday she told me about all the rules she follows. I can't agree to that for an entire year.

It would be much better for her to find another Orthodox Jew to room with who follows the same practices. It's also much better for me to find someone who doesn't care, the way I don't care.

The reason this might be asshole-ish is that I agreed a month ago, and I'm backing out now. We have until July 1st to have everything finalized and most people are decided on housing by now. It will be challenging."		1	0

"All right a bit of back story here. I am in medical school in a different country I uprooted my life to make something of myself. My mother has the ""I'd like to speak to the manager haircut"", and believes everything she reads on facebook, not an anti-vaxxer here is some of the stuff she's done prior to me losing my shit: 

My dad had an infection on his hand, which led to a wart he was picking at it, I encouraged my dad to go see a doctor instantly and get antibiotics. My mom told him to put coconut oil on it... He did and then proceeded to go to the doctor and told him he should not have been putting ANYTHING on it. 

My brother had/has bad acne and her solution again, coconut oil... for acne... 

She slipped and fell and sprained her ankle, I told her she needs to follow the RICE method and she asked me ""can I only do ice"". I said no that only helps reduce the swelling you need to do EVERYTHING. She refused to listen. She is still dealing with that injury a year later. Now here is where shit gets infuriating... She went to a REAL doctor and they did an MRI and didn't find anything. They told her to essentially stay off the leg (no fucking shit). She went to this Japanese ""doctor"". He apparently thinks her veins are tangled and are causing pain and is removing her veins. 

Now apparently ""she's better"" but every couple hours there is pain and she needs to ""rest"". At this point I have already withdrawn myself from giving advice since it's clearly not needed. Now this same ""doctor"" apparently helped her with her ""celiac disease"" she's been celiac for the longest time and she did a parasite cleanse (something I suggested ages ago and something she told me she has done and it DID NOT WORK). She is now able to eat bread. 

[Now she also buys this](https://www.melaleuca.com/ProductStore/Product?sku=591) from that same doctor, I tried to explain to her that there is nothing in there that is patented that PROVES it works. But she spends 100s of dollars on this garbage. Whatever I gave up that fight a long time ago. 

Now here is where she crossed the line, I was a bit stressed out because my girlfriend found out her cancer is back, because I'm so far away I skype with my parents and I was screen sharing my computer and my GFs whatsapp messages with me were there and she saw them. She didn't say anything until after we hung up and she messages me immediately after asking if she can tell me something without be getting mad. I was like okay what's the worst thing you can ask. She says maybe you should send your GF to this ""doctor"" he's ""helped me"" so much. That was my breaking point, I lost my shit. I flat out told her she is disrespecting everything I am working for, I told this story to a few of my colleagues in school and they agree with me that it is insulating to us.

I told the friend who invites if he is serious and he said yes, I told him he is a jerk and he can be sure that he won't see me anymore in a long time and I blocked him on social media. My friends think I am over exaggerating this and I am an asshole for getting angry on him, but I really don't understand how can friends act like that (I'm more sensitive than most people so that's why I think why I might be in the wrong here.

bybfex	2019-06-08 19:12:38		AITA: She Blamed a Dead Baby	"Hello Redditors! Back in 2015 I lost my 18 month old son in a daycare accident. The daycare provider put him in a closet in a carseat that was too small for him and he ended up being strangled by the car seat straps. Needless to say, this hasn't been an easy journey. On top of this, I suffer from BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). Well long story short, we went to court for the criminal prosecution, where we had to deliver victim impact statements and my siblings didn't come. My sister was the godmother of my deceased son. When I told them this upset me because they weren't there to support me they got angry. Well, this April marked the one year anniversary of the court hearing and I again told them how hurt I was that they hadn't come and that I am having a hard time getting over it. This time my sister-in-law said this to me, and I quote, ""You use your dead son as an excuse to be nasty to people, and you need to get over this. Peace out dude."" I don't know what to do or how to handle this comment. Am I the asshole for brining it up again? Should I just have let it go?"		1	0

"Me and this girl started talking a few weeks ago, after a few days of talking I asked her to be my girlfriend (yes I know I was rushing into things) and she basically said yes, but she wanted to get to know me first before we start dating. During these few days she mentioned her last boyfriend had broken up with her because he thought she was cheating on him with her friend. The next 2 weeks we talked a lot, flirting heavily. She made it clear she was into me, and was just trying to get to know me better before we started dating. That's when I saw the Instagram posts. There were a few Instagram posts of her talking about how John was her baby, John was the love of her life, John telling her she was the most beautiful thing in the world and that she gives him butterflies, and her responding with some shit like ""omg this is why I love u so much I'm so lucky to have you"" and she posted screenshots of them flirting heavily. There was no way they were just ""friends"" I don't even think me and my ex-fiance flirted this heavy when we were dating. I sent her a screenshot of one of the posts and said ""Who's John?"" And she said ""Oh, that's my friend I was telling you about"" I put two and two together and realized this was the friend her ex-boyfriend thought she was cheating on him with. I thought nothing of it, and thought she was far too nice and sweet to be deceptive or lie (I know, stupid me). Then I saw a post saying she had a boyfriend. She had never mentioned a boyfriend, and said she was single.

So I asked her who her boyfriend was, and sure enough, it's John. I sent her a screenshot of when she said they were just friends, and she said ""We just started dating"" Fucking bullshit. Clearly they were dating before I even started talking to this girl, judging by the constant Instagram posts of her calling him baby, and saying how much she loves him, and it's obvious she tried pulling this same bullshit with her last boyfriend, and he dumped her because of it. So I blocked her on everything, because I don't wanna even be friends with someone like that."	Not the A-hole	0	0

We have great chemistry and our relationship couldn't be better. 7 months ago, I fully committed to her and quit my job that I loved so that we could stay in the city she lived for cheap as we prepared for a move to another state.

However, in the process of looking for work and a new place, a job she applied to a year prior opened up in town. This job is her dream. It was all she has ever wanted to do in a field that is very difficult to get into. I mean, it took her a year just to get an interview. Of course, I told her she had to go for it and take it. She's amazing so they offered her a job and she has never been happier. She is in a great relationship, a great job, and after months and months of trying, we finally succeeded in her getting pregnant.

I am happy with her, but I am not happy with where will live or my current situation with work. I got a job in town since commuting to my old job would cost $100 a week plus gas and it is not worth it financially. Having this job I hate in a town I hate is just soul crushing. I try not to show her since I am happy with here and she has never been better, but she knows me better than that.

She still 'wants' to move and find another job in our new state, but the rules for entry there are slightly more strict(masters degree instead of bachelor) so she will have to return to her previous field. She was content in her, but I feel like an asshole if I take away her dream. We are at a sort of crossroads and I want us to move.

She had my son for the last 3 weeks, and she texted me that he had ringworm. Here's the kicker: she gave it to him. She claims she thought she was having an eczema flareup and was putting eczema cream on it for a week until our son got it too. I'm furious with her for being irresponsible. She should have kept the rash covered and away from our son who now has to suffer for her irresponsibility. When I saw her and my son, and the big rash on my son's arm, I lost it at her and yelled at her for not addressing her own issues with a doctor before getting our son sick. She should have discussed this with me while it was happening, step by step, so I could have told her to go to the doctor to keep our son safe. His medical safety and prevention related to it should be my business. I told her I'd take her to court unless she let my mother drop in and check on my son at least once a week until I can trust her again.

byb9ul	2019-06-08 18:57:32	jjolteon	AITA For wanting to put in a noise complaint about the construction workers outside for playing music too loud?	"Hi all. To preface, I live in an apartment complex near my college that has some construction happening right next to my apartment. The workers have been playing the radio for the past hour extremely loudly, to the point where I can very much hear it in my bedroom and especially my living room.

&#x200B;

Additionally, I was hanging with some friends last night and ended up passing out and hitting my head pretty hard on a garage floor and am just trying to rest up from that today. That being said, I'm a little more cranky than usual and would just like to sleep but cannot due to the noise. I've tried wearing headphones or listening to something else but it really just worsens my headache.

&#x200B;

I called my apartment complex and asked if there was anything they could do about it, and they simply told me ""Well it's a third party so deal with it on your own."" (Which admittedly makes me more annoyed.) I called once more and they told me to call the police on the non-emergency line and put in a noise complaint. It was about 1:20 pm when i decided that if they didn't stop within the hour, I would call the non-emergency line. I know I could ask them myself, but I really am just not confident enough to speak up in these kinds of situations.

&#x200B;

So, on one hand, it's Texas and it is hot as hell and no one likes to be working on a Saturday so I would hate to make their job harder. On the other hand, I would love to get some rest.

"Background on this: I have never seen eye to eye with my mother in law. MIL also has a boyfriend who I don't care for either. 

It has been her dream to take my kids on a Disney Cruise ever since they were born. We have had massive issues with her not caring about their safety (most egregious example, she let my daughter ride on the dashboard--yes the dashboard--of her car on the highway going 80mph. Her excuse was ""she had so much fun! I couldn't help it!). So I told her that if we could all go then maybe I would I consider it. 

Her boyfriends mom died last year and he got like a small $30000 inheritance and she talked him into spending it all on a Disney cruise for the entire family (two of them, husband and I, two kids). I am going because everyone is excited but I am dreading every single minute of it. I don't really like cruises, Disney is not my thing and we are going to be away from our business for about two weeks so getting back is going to be a nightmare. 

I was packing up last night and my now 8 year old came up to me and said ""Grandma said we are going to push you over the railing on day one so the rest of us can have some fun."" I was like whoa. I asked her what else she said and it was something like ""when your drowning she's going to hook Daddy up with a huge black lady who isn't such a snit about bad food.""

I immediately went to my husband and told him I was cancelling the trip. She has said things like this to my kids before so while it may not be an exact retelling, I know Bella didn't make this up. My husband is begging me not to cancel because he really needs the break from work. I told him fine, we'll take a two week camping trip or go to the beach but for me being around his mom will be worse than work--let alone she made a joke about murdering me. 

Kids are despondent that we might not go and now guilt is getting to me. would I be the asshole if I cancel this trip?

Edit (I guess 4 hours since OP): Thank you for all the advice, from you guys this is my plan of action:

1. I (and we) are going on the cruise. 

2. I’m going to far more fun than she ever could be, moms going to ride ATVs and do the rock wall. Her plan is just to stuff them with cake and candy. 

3. I’m going to talk with whoever I need to to ensure that my husband and I are the only ones who can kids out of activities. 

4. I’m going to thank her boyfriend profusely for paying for the trip. 

edit: I forgot the most important part, my husband is on his way over to her house to talk to her in person that what she said is not ok and go over the rules for the trip. She's going to have a meltdown but it's what she got by acting like a complete ass. 

Anything I’m missing?

Edit3: lots of you asking what happened after my husband talked with her last night, this is a C&P from a reply I made:

>She just head nodded him and cried last night doing her typical ""whoa is me, I never meant anything by it I was just being funny"" like she always does. She's in for a real surprise when we get on the ship and her plans to have the kids sleep in her room and feed them awful food isn't going to happen.

Growing up it was always just my mom and me, I’d see my dad, mostly on school holidays when mom needed someone to watch me while she was at work and on special occasions, when he wasn’t in jail that is. To be honest he was always more occupied with whatever new girlfriend he had at the time and her children if she had them. 

In recent years that has also been the case, he’s also paid more attention to my brother and his kids (he’s only been in contact with my brother for the past 3 years, as my brother wasn’t aware that he was his father or that I existed) he’s repeatedly told me that he doesn’t celebrate holidays/birthdays and the like, something my mom insists is just part of his “prison mentality” (he was locked up for over a decade while I was growing up) but the first Christmas he was home, he got presents for my brothers kids, didn’t get me anything, I got him a Father’s Day present last year, he refuses to use it, and now that Father’s Day is coming up again, my mom keeps asking what I’m getting him, but what’s the point? I don’t really see a point in getting anything. AITA?

"I have a younger brother by about a year, and since we were born I’ve always led by my example, which he would observe. I’ve been told that he had apparently a hard act to follow, which is nice as he can try branch out and be his own person. 

Problem is, I don’t like my brother, he’s typically rude, doesn’t like talking to me (even though my mom gets on me about not talking to him), and sometimes messes with me. Lately he’s been apparently turning a new leaf as my parents have said, and it’s nice but nothing too great. It’s more he’s not mean, but he’s not really nice ether. 

Since then I’ve been told that I need to be the one to steer him in the right direction, and treat him nicely, and help him out. I mean on a basic level respect is important, but things like me needing to get him food he’s too lazy to grab, or offer to play games with him, when he could easily do the same for me. I think that just because I’m the older one, that I shouldn’t have to be the one who has to do things with him like he’s my son, and will be at fault if I don’t do anything.

My argument is that he could do the same for me, I don’t think I should be like a third parent, and force myself to be there for his contrasting immaturity. We usually get a long fine away from each other, since there’s not much we have in common, so I think it best to be out of each other’s hair.

byb4qb	2019-06-08 18:43:43		AITA For Not Wanting People Over All the Time?	"I (27f) have a roommate (34m) that I get along with reasonably well overall. We sometimes argue over housework, but are still pretty good friends. We have lived together for a year and a half. Our house is small, with two small bedrooms (mine being very small) upstairs and one living space downstairs.  I have a tv in my room, and his tv is in the living room. 

&#x200B;

About 6 months ago, I had it with him having people over almost every day. I felt like I could never be comfortable in my own home. Despite repeatedly bringing it up, he did not listen to how I was feeling until I yelled, which I hate doing. We came up with a compromise: he could not have people over more than 2 days in a row. I feel like that is still pretty generous. 

&#x200B;

The frustration: He won't have anyone over Friday, and then have friends or his girlfriend (who I have no personal problem with at all, but am not friends with) over all day both weekend days.  It feels uncomfortable for me when I hang out with them downstairs because it is pretty obvious they would prefer I not be there. I get annoyed because with this because I am essentially stuck in my small room all day both weekend days while they are in the living room. I rarely have people over. He says they have to hang out in the living room and not in his bedroom because that is where the tv is. He gets upset if I suggest he moves it to his bedroom. 

&#x200B;

Other notes: I make myself scarce when he has hookups over (he is in an open relationship) but he absolutely refuses to do the same on the incredibly rare occasion I do. He feels free to have sex with them on the couch or in his room. I have to have sex in my room, and he won't just hang out in his room while they are leaving my bedroom. It is awkward and I would rather he not be visible for 5 minutes, like I do for him the entire time they are over.

&#x200B;

When I bring up that I get annoyed with him having someone over, he calls me a dick and says we have an agreement. Which is 100% true. I am 2 seconds from refusing to hide in my room anymore and just staying in the living room whenever he has people over, which I know will annoy him. I am just so frustrated and feel trapped in my own home. I don't want to be an asshole, this just isn't working for me. I really cannot afford to live on my own (though I am working on it).

byb47f	2019-06-08 18:42:22	retroactiveBurn	AITA - I[41M] felt my gf[43F] of 2.5 years was flirting with a coworker pretty intensely during our volleyball game	"We’ve been together for 2.5 years, she works in lots of different facilities around the area and gets to know a lot of people and is very social which is nice as I am not so we actually get out and do things. However, I have noticed that she doesn’t have a boundary filter between being social and flirting, there is a difference, right?


On to the volleyball game we were down a few players this time around, co-worker plays on the next tier up and she originally asked him to be on the team but his buddy asked him first. He’s nice, definitely a good-looking guy that works out and it’s evident, not that I don’t, he’s just put much more effort into it and is much younger than me. So, we get setup he’s in between my gf and I on the court, now I honestly say I have no problems with him, he was friendly to me for the most part, played well on court, etc. We had gone out to a bar with him and his fiancé before so I could see how he and my gf had interacted then, and it was much, much different this time. Much more “banter” as my gf called it, and that’s not my problem per se it was how animated she was and how she was constantly looking at him, high fives and laughing, joking, and giggling with him. Needless to say, she and I have never had interaction like that on or off the court and it was a little disturbing to me, like to me it was obvious flirting. Her excuse was that he didn’t know anyone on the team and she wanted to make him feel welcome…well he had another player that was also an old coworker and they were no where near as interactive. So I can toss that excuse out the window.


Backstory, I had bought her a Supergirl outfit for the bedroom, she then wore it to work the following Halloween, it was a little bit revealing not horribly so, he had mentioned to her that she should wear it to work more often. So yeah, I’m sure there’s an attraction there.


She could tell something was wrong on the court that night and I told her I would talk to her later about it. When I told her, she said that they were def. not flirting that they he’s like the brother she never had. I don’t know but I def don’t act that way with my sister. We proceed to argue for a while and she went home that night. The next day at work she brought it up with him and apparently, they had a good laugh over it, which I didn’t find cool at all. She had also mentioned that morning that she talked with her friend S who is on the team and my gf said she didn’t think it was flirting either….but the issue came up again last night in conversation and she said well I’ll talk to S to get her opinion on it, so she lied to me about talking to her friend to make me think that her, her coworker and her friend didn’t think there was flirting going on. What?


TL;DR gf was flirty during volleyball game with good looking co-worker, I call her out, she gets upset says “I’m just social” then laughed about it with said co-worker and lied about discussing it with her friend who is also on the team."	Not the A-hole	0	0

(40/F, transplant to a very insular community, have a degree of physical disability - this is all a factor here).

Several years ago our family moved to a very insular community where people are suspicious of newcomers (a lot come here looking to escape very serious problems). To ""get in good with others"" and show I am a decent person who cares about the community, I started doing a lot of volunteer work at my kids' school & took a temp job (underemployed but when nobody HERE knows me, all I could get).

Not long after I was hit by a truck and badly injured. I was basically left to myself as I've struggled through my injuries while a lot of other adults in the community have been very cruel to me, making fun of my injuries.

ETA: I will always volunteer at the school when I can, as I feel it keeps my kids from potentially being mistreated. There are some good people there, but they don't challenge the assholes.

My kids' school got several angry phone calls that I never picked up my phone while in physical therapy, the ER, or during major surgery. Last time I volunteered there, a teacher screamed at me in front of my son's class bc my limp means I walk too slow. 

My job... I'm hourly and always being pressured to work free overtime (which is illegal), as well as there is a young woman whose ass male senior leadership kisses. She's called multiple meetings w them to make claims about me that weren't true (easy to verify). In last week's, she said it's MY fault a department I don't interact with has some major problems after a RIF. The end result was I got a talking-to that I need to do X,Y,Z to accommodate her tantrums and feelings. 

Even at home I'm constantly fighting with my husband because I can't clean fast enough, do enough, get a good enough job, make enough friends. The common factor is me, but... another common factor is a shitty environment.

Family & friends from home want me to pursue a professional license/degree that i have no interest in, and due to my brain injury from the truck can't pass the exam.

Every time I have medical appointment, I get in a fight with (insert douchebag who feels entitled to my time). Several times a day, I have someone getting in my face because I can't be in two places at once or bend others' will.

My kids are at an age where their constant need for my time and effort is understandable. All others here are adults. 

If just fucking once someone had a kind word, or 30 seconds w/o demanding something, I'd feel differently.

I'm physically and emotionally drained; I do more than an able-bodied person for way less thanks and I'm completely fucking exhausted.

I'm seriously considering one day next week just not getting out of bed, telling people that since I can't do enough for anyone I'm just going to take a few days to myself.

When we’re together she will always say ‘I’m hungry!’ So we will get food and she will only eat half of hers or whatever and then give her food to me. I’ve learnt to only order about 2/3 of food that I know will fill me up. I eat quite slowly so she will usually eat her portion then push her food over to me or whatever and then continue to pick at her food while I finish mine. It’s kind of a joke between us so I know she sees it as just a funny little thing but her continuing to pick at her food while I eat it (if we get burger and chips for example, she will continue to kinda pick at the chips while I’m eating the rest of her burger etc).

Her continuing to eat her food while I’m also eating her food annoys me for reasons I don’t really know. I’ll say ‘hey, sorry can you stop picking at my (used to be her) food’ and she’ll stop but roll her eyes and laugh at me. The other day I heard her talking to her friend saying I’m the best boyfriend but (quoted) ‘he does this really assholeish thing where I give him my food after I don’t want it but I still continue to pick at it because I’m still kinda hungry u know, and he always gets annoyed at me. I don’t get it because it’s still technically my food right?!’ And laughed. It wasn’t a super serious thing, they were just kinda joking around about how annoying boyfriends can be.

To skip pass most of the history I will focus on the last couple of weeks.The month of June as summer approaches usually involved lots of family obligations regarding graduations, camping trips, weddings, etc. We have a parenting in place where my son is at his father's every other weekend and every wednesday. Of course every other weekend is not as accommodating to every family event so we occasionally switch weekends.

I was contacted by FOC mother requesting my son to attend a family event for memorial day weekend.  Child was with his father's side for two weekends 5/17-19 and 5/24-27. Due to the switched weekend of the last week of May that would make my son be with the mother's side of the family for the following two weekends of June. 

Due to a family obligation on my side of the family I addressed to FOC that there is a graduation 6/14-6/15 on his weekend and father's day weekend. I texted FOC regarding the month of June. The texts include,

5/25 - Can you look at the calendar for June. It is lacking in blue/dad days. Let me know which ones you wanna pick up.

5/29 - Did you want to check the schedule and see what other days you wanna have (child's name)

\- Due to all of the switch weekends and family events I think you are lacking some.

5/30 - Can you look at the link I sent you,. It has the calendar.

\- Please check out the google doc schedule let me know what days work for you

6/1 - Are there any summer/family events that I should be aware of

\- Can you please check the link/schedule above and let me know what says you want/need him

\-There is a lot of events happening and I need to know

Due to multiple attempts to communicate I have continued with my regular planned arrangements for the month of June. I contacted paternal father's mom as well asking if there was any family events that I needed to be aware of she responded with how there was an event this coming weekend . I declined stating I already had prior commitments.

I sent screenshots and listed the times I have reached out regarding scheduling of June. My mom called the other Grandma and handed me the phone and the conversation just went, I dunno you gotta talk to (father). I called FOC, which only constituted in, "" you stupid selfish bitch, don't fucking lie to me, I don't have time for your bullshit"". Before I could respond he hung up. I'm in bed and visibly upset, my son half asleep sees me crying and asks me what's wrong( I can't explain why for obviously reasons). and hugs me and ends up crying himself to sleep.

Throughout the week I have received multiple texts from his family regarding me being selfish, not being accommodating. Am I being the asshole?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

byavxs	2019-06-08 18:20:03		AITA for wanting to travel alone for my birthday?	I’m officially turning 30 next month. My family is going out of town and my GF just started a new position at work so she can’t request off. I don’t have friends outside of that and I honestly don’t want to have to count on anyone to make plans. I’ll basically have 4 days off so I told my gf I want to travel not too far. I live in Florida so I’m thinking the keys or Tampa because I have a season pass for Busch gardens. Anyways we were talking about it and I told her I’d have to be back on my birthday anyways because I’ll have to go to work the next day so I’d be back home in time after she gets off work and we can have a little celebration dinner. She keeps trying to make it so she sleeps over the two nights before my birthday and I’m just like it’s dumb because she’ll be at work the entire day until almost 7pm and I’ll be home alone waiting. She knew about my birthday months in advance and I told her to try and request the days off before her promotion happened but she kept saying her coworkers requested time off first so she couldn’t, and then she keeps trying to make the plans for the weekend when she’s off but I’m not (I work wed-sun off on mon and tues). Plus it will no longer be my birthday. Anyways, am I the asshole for wanting to travel for my birthday?		1	0
byauoi	2019-06-08 18:16:33	ThrowawayPBandJSando	AITA for not sharing my groceries with my boyfriend?	"F(21) M (21) 

My boyfriend and I go grocery shopping every week for ingredients for homemade dinners, frozen dinners, drinks like jugs of lemonade, medication, etc.

I pay for everything in our relationship- joint grocery hauls included- because he has student loans and I would rather him pay those off quickly. I can afford these ~$340 a month expenses and he works part time.

There are things I buy for myself, treats if you will, like the occasional expensive chocolate bar, small tin of cookies, expensive slice of cheese or the like. These things are expensive and small in size, so I do not want to share. I paid for it after all and don’t mind my boyfriend doing a second scan of his personal beers or shaving supplies, I just put my stuff with our joint groceries because it’s my card being swiped.

The issue is, when I proceed to eat said treats, even though they are explicitly mine, he will make a disappointed face when I don’t share. AITA for not sharing? We live together and I want to eat my snacks like a normal person, not hide them and sneak bites when he’s not home but he always gives me the guilt look.

byas8e	2019-06-08 18:10:12	So_Ill_Continue	AITA for potentially “stealing” my parents on Xmas?	"I (20F) was studying abroad in Europe (from the US). My parents and I had previously agreed that a visit from them wasn't an option, as we don't have much extra cash. At this point I thought I was staying 6 months not 12.

A few months later and it's Xmas time. Everyone that came from my college had their parents or SOs coming. The natives I knew were also busy. I started to feel a bit sad and lonely. 

Important note: my problem wasn't that I would be alone on Xmas (although I didn't *love* the idea). It was that Xmas, a time ideally spent with loved ones, was highlighting how I wouldn't be able to see my parents for another 9+ months (my stay had just been extended). My family is close, so being away for so long was hard.

My mom then calls to say that there are affordable tickets, but they would be arriving on Xmas. Although excited, I had reservations. 1st, I wanted to make sure that they were OK with spending part of Xmas traveling. They reassured me they were, as it could be a vacation in addition to seeing me. This made sense -my mom is Christian but not religious and my dad isn't Christian, so seeing me and some sights could be worth some traveling on Xmas. My 2nd hangup was that I have siblings, ""S"" (24F) and ""B"" (27M) who live near/with my parents respectively, and I didn't want to take my parents away from them on the holiday. My mom countered that they could simply celebrate on Xmas Eve, which I found reasonable. Still, I said that I only wanted them to come on Xmas if that was the *only way* they could afford it. 

I honestly did not think that my sibs would object. S has had to split holidays between us and her SOs family for a few years, so we've had to alter our plans and work around her schedule before. B (who has no SO) is known in our family for not having an opinion on almost anything. I would, of course, want their approval, but I figured they would understand if it was the ONLY WAY I could see our parents.

My parents found other tics, but I discovered later that S was absolutely NOT OK with plan A. She argued that 1) I made the decision to go abroad so it would be unfair if I 'took' our parents on Xmas 2) they should be home 3) B didn't have an SO and would be alone and 4) I could come home. I gave her the same reasons I wrote above (including the change from 6 to 12 months), but she wasn’t persuaded.

Conversely, I thought that her prioritizing her Xmas over my ability to see my parents for an entire year was a bit low.

&#x200B;

It's probably dumb to post this since it ended up fine, but I think about it a lot. I have long been accused by S of being selfish/entitled, so I'm scared that IATA. 

In sum: My parents could only afford to visit me abroad on Xmas Day. Had other plans not worked out, my sister would have been furious and possibly prevented the trip. AITA for wanting them to come and/or being mad at my sister if they didn't?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
byars6	2019-06-08 18:09:02		AITA For trying to stop my buddy from proposing?	"TL;DR - Friend (31M) wants to marry girlfriend (26F) of 6 months and move them and HER 3 kids across the country to start a life together (leaving job and selling everything).

I have a close friend of mine who started seeing this girl about 6 months ago. They met over Tinder while she was driving through his town in route to Florida (she’s from MN and he’s from IL).

He was recently out of a relationship and those two had broken up because she wanted kids and he didn’t. Within WEEKS, he meets this passerby and they hit it off. 

All the sudden he starts making weekend trips up to see her and her THREE KIDS (with two dads, one dad being a convicted felon). 

Fast-forward 6 months and he tell us all (close group of 10-14 friends) that he bought a ring. 

Up to this point he’s spent countless thousands of dollars in travel, taking her and her kids on vacations and buying her expensive gifts. He’s nearly run out of money and is looking to sell his Camaro to subsidize these expenditures and he’s purchased the 1.75 carat diamond ring on credit.

At the moment, he’s told us that he plans to leave his well paying job, sell his house and car and move them all from both MN and IL to FL to start over. 

After a group camping trip where we all get to meet her for the first time we decide collectively it’s time to intervene (she’s super manipulative and dominating). We spoke to his only living parent to see how she felt about the situation and we found out that she’s equally concerned. 

We decided to hold a legit intervention for him next Wednesday, before he takes off for Ireland to propose later that week. 

Am I the asshole here for wanting them to pump the breaks?  Maybe live together somewhere closer first (somewhere with a support group) and after maaaybe a year or two make that next move?"		1	0
byarl1	2019-06-08 18:08:27	dontpanic4224	AITA for not telling my gf that I am buying stuff from a game?	"Hello Reddit! English is not my first language, but here we go:

So basically I've been playing this mobile game called Clash Royale and there you can buy, with real money, gems to boost your account and other cosmetic stuff.

I know my girlfriend thinks it's a waste of money. Also, we live together and deal with our expenses together as well. And we never really had any big financial problems.

From time to time there are offers/bundles in the game's store so you can buy stuff cheaper. I've been buying these offers (and offers only) whenever I feel like it. But I never felt like I had to tell her I was doing it or ask for permission or whatever.

She used to play this game with me but never really got into it and ended up quitting.

So today I was showing her this bundle that had gold, gems and an ""emote"", which is like a reaction to use in battles. It had a great price and the emote looked really nice. But she told me not to buy it. I asked why and she said it was because it's a waste of money. I told her I liked it and people spend money in way more stupid stuff. She asked me if I ever bought things from the game before and I said yes. So she freaked out and asked how much I've spent with the game so far. I checked my credit card bills and I've spent roughly $100 (a hundred US dollars) with it in 2 years since I started playing the game. 

She then got really mad at me and told me I should've at least talked to her about it. She said I was lying to her. We argued and she left the house not telling me where she was going.

I also bought it anyway.

byar0y	2019-06-08 18:06:59		AITA for refusing to evaluate an out- patient ?	"Context: I am working as a registrar in a primary health clinic. I have been trained in ultrasounds and other routine radiology procedures. When usually ultrasounds are done, the patient is explained the process, what is expected of her/her, and what is to be expected from the procedure - namely how to expose the area to be evaluated, and how a staff will be present as chaperone. in antenatal ultrasounds - another qualifier that is added that the gender of the fetus will not be revealed under any circumstances. this is both implicit, as well as explicitly mentioned in the consent form, as well as explained to the patient in their local language.

So, today i got a referral for performing an antenatal ultrasound. The patient is a 21 year old lady, married for 3-4 months, currently amenorrheic for 3 months. The procedure was explained to her, and she signed a consent form. She was taken to the ultrasound room, and her abdomen was exposed. A cloth was kept over her (clothed) pelvic area, and she was asked to place her arms on either side of the head, so that the probe wire doesn't' tangle with her upper limbs.

5-10 minutes later, I entered the room. She was lying comfortably, and seemed reasonably relaxed. I made small talk with her, while prepping for the procedure - applying the gel, inputting patient data. As soon as i moved the probe towards her abdomen, she recoiled and covered her abdomen. The nurse standing with me asked her to relax, and to expose the abdomen, as it was the only way to visualize the fetus. Now, at 12 weeks, the uterus barely reaches the abdomen, and is more in the pelvis, so i mentioned the same to her. She seemed anxious and a bit uncomfortable. So, i asked her if she was alright, and she admitted to being a bit anxious. I reassured her, but she wouldn't expose her abdomen, constantly bringing her hands to her pelvic region. 10 minutes of measured talk, and getting increasingly frustrated, i suggested she go somewhere else for the same, and asked send her to cash counter for refund.

She begins to apologize, but by then I has reached the end of my tether. I couldn't be objective about evaluating her, and refused to entertain her. She called her husband, and he called a lot of other people, and the matter reached the police \[EDIT: The husband called a acquaintance of his, who promptly came over with 3-4 fellows, and when i refused to entertain them either, they went and filed a complaint against me for not treating a patient - something common in the region I work. They went and lodged a complaint. Next thing i know are the cops walking up to the room where i sit to evaluate patients telling a complaint has been filed against me by a concerned party\] -  who say i am in the wrong for refusing to accept her apology, and that i should perform the USG, and that proceedings will be initiated against me if i refuse to comply. she is not critically ill, and is haemodynamically stable, nor there is any threat to the life from the pregnancy. I can refuse to treat her, and i will. AITA here?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Some Clarifiers:

1. I am a man.
2. All ultrasounds(male/female) are performed in the presence of a chaperone - in this case a senior nurse.
3. Please don't call my parents names in PM's. Please be civil. If you would rather i delete this post, i would.

EDIT 2: I am doctor. I am currently undergoing Internal Medicine training. Have been trained in radiology for 12 weeks, before being posted in a PHC as part of my rotations. Here, people undergoing training in specialisations are called registrars. Sorry, I didn't think of the non-American aspect of it. Sincere apologies.

He doesn't leave the vent on, leaves on either medium or medium high, leaves it unattended for a bit, and these are pans that I personally were gifted.

There's been issues that we've resolved where I feel like he doesn't take care of the things I own and let him use, and he just tells me he can fix it if it breaks or it's not a big deal. I don't make a lot of money, and the bits I save up for and spend on a furniture piece here and there I tend to really be proud of. I know it's not inherently dangerous to just leave the pan there for a bit, but he's forgotten stuff completely before and set our fire alarm off before.

byao7y	2019-06-08 17:59:53	HolyWater2	AITA For Yelling At My Mom?	"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mom and I have pretty much always had a decent relationship with each other. It's not amazing but It's not bad either.One thing I hate about my mom is how she's extremely bias towards my sister. My mom always calls me and my brother to help her do yard work or she'll call us to help her clean the house. I don't mind doing yard work or cleaning, but my sister never has to do any of that. She doesn't do yard work at all, rarely ever cleans anything aside from her room, and doesn't help cook often. Whenever I ask my mom why my sister didn't have to help, my mom always ends either saying "" I'll make her do her help"" which ends up never happening, or she'll go on a rant about how I always complain when cleaning or yard work.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But like I said before, cleaning isn't the issue, the issue is how my sister doesn't have to do any of this. To be fair my sister is in IB( International Baccalaureate, It's a school program) and she gets a lot of HW because of that, but cleaning and yard work only takes 1-2 hours. But my mom always dismisses the fact that I also have some homework to finish. It's never nearly as much as my sisters, but I'd still like to get it done. Even yesterday, my brother and I had to help clean my mom's car. I asked why my sister isn't helping and in a nutshell, my mom said "" why do you always complain about this? You don't ever clean anything. Do you not know the amount of work your sister has to do? Stop complaining for once."" 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After that my mom said it's my job to tell my sister to do her chores and that if she doesn't, then it's my fault and I have to do it. My mom said my sister doesn't have to do yard work or clean because of her HW. But I told my mom about how my sister just uses her HW as an excuse to get out of doing house work and that she often isn't doing it. Example: for a good chunk of last week, my sister lied about doing homework and was talking with her friend about how her friend was DMing some guy in their school who was good at sensing people's personalities without ever interacting with them. She also often watches YouTube videos instead of doing HW. After I told my mom about that, she still didn't tell my sister to help clean the car. My mom said "" she doesn't have to do this because she's a girl and you're a guy"". My peers at school often say I'm not a very emotional person, and I agree, but that moment, I got a bit frustrated and yelled at my mom, telling her this isn't fair and that she's bias. I know I shouldn't be yelling at the person who takes care of me and keeps me safe, but I just couldn't help it at that moment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So people of Reddit, in this situation, is my mom the asshole or me?

I shove my clothes in the washer, and start a timer on my phone — I go out when my timer beeps and discover a guy I’ve never seen before shoving his clothes in the washer, with my wet clothes taken out.
So I say, “I don’t think it’s good laundry etiquette to removes somebody else’s laundry”.. He disagrees.
Exchange of words for a bit; mostly he makes the claim that he’s lived in many complexes and he “always does that” — Now I say that I’ve been in his shoes; came across a full, finished washer— However, I’ve waited, 30-40 minutes, *never* touching somebody else’s laundry, no matter what. It is responsible to start a timer, like I always do, so as to not traffic-jam the laundry.
He apologizes passive aggressively only after my girlfriend showed yo; noting “ive said sorry 4 times now”.  I don’t really care about apologies and I wasn’t pressing for one.. It just irks me when some stranger touches my clean laundry.

byalj8	2019-06-08 17:52:47		AITA for wanting a secondary physical with another PA?	"I went for my annual physical yesterday, I've been to this clinic once before when I had my physical last year. The PA I had last year was great, she was super responsive to my questions, a very nice person, and I felt she did a great job and we had a good rapport. I made an appointment with a different PA for this physical since my PA from last year was on leave. The office did not say when she would return. 

&#x200B;

The new PA was horrible. She only did about half of the physical examination my PA from last year did. She didn't check my reflexes, my limbs, etc. Every problem I brought up to her over that I've had over the last year, she just said ""use this over the counter product"". She didn't even want me to get blood work because ""you're young and should only get it once very two years."" I'm 27. I pushed for it since since they told me last year I had elevated cholesterol, which the PA dismissed as me having been ""misinformed, your cholesterol levels were normal."" When I complained about heartburn being particularity painful and seeming more widespread than it should, she just told me to take tums. I left with no prescriptions, just recommendations for expensive over the counter medicine that costs more than most of my prescriptions cost out of pocket. I have a really good prescription plan that covers most medications fully.

&#x200B;

I'm not a hypochondriac. I felt I was rushed out of there and barely listened too. I'm not the kind of person that runs to the doctor for every little thing so not being listened to the one time of a year I go to the doctor was maddening. I went years without health insurance, so since I can go now I want to make the most of it. I called my insurance company to see if I could qualify with a different medical professional for another physical, and they said yes as long as it's not billed as physical but a regular doctor's visit. 

&#x200B;

I told my story to a friend who said I'm being ridiculous and whining and I shouldn't clog up the medical system with BS.I should be happy with any medical care I received since so many people can't afford health care as it is. I think I have a right to quality physical where I feel like my concerns are addressed and not just given information I could have googled myself. The over the counter medication cost $35 out of pocket for a month's supply and honestly that's a lot for me since I don't even know if it will work. This was also generic stuff, not the name brand stuff the PA recommended. I took the job I have now primarily for the low cost-high quality health insurance.  AITA for wanting another physical?"

My mom had been talking about this guy she was into, let's call him Tom. So I guess you can say I'm rebellious so I've been fighting with my mom a lot. So I dont hear a thing about Tom and all of a sudden, I'm getting ready for school, when I hear heavy breathing from my moms room. 

A bit later, he comes out of the room. The house is really small so my room is some what close to hers. He exits the front door but leaves it open. I waited a couple minutes and when he didn't enter, I walked over and looked to see he was on his phone near his car.

So I slammed and locked the door on him. My mom was so mad but forgave me. Now shes doing it again. So I wanna make as much noise as possible to ruin the mood. But my brother says it's too immature. Might do it anyway 

Tl;dr my mom and her ""boyfriend"" are savagely humping without giving a damn about the people in the house.

EDIT: After reading everyone's post, I'm still a little confused on how I feel, I think I agree with the ESH. Maybe I shouldnt act bratty but I'm angered that my mom doesn't consider anyone else's feelings. She'll go out late at night and I wake up to find her still drinking and for HOURS she'll be stuck in there, doing... things with him. We didn't even meet him or anything.

I live with my mom, two older sisters and a 5-year old nephew.  My girlfriend came over to visit and stay the night, this happens literally every week. And the 5 year old, adores her. So much so we probably spent like 4 hours with  him this weekend after he would just come into my room and play video games and stuff. 
And so he was with us and kept asking us if we wanted to go swimming. Now, we told him that no we didnt feel like it. Ofcourse he is 5 and didnt like this answer. He asked again and we said no. His mom (my sister) comes into my room and litterally cannot get him out of my room. Because he wants to stay with us because we are sort of like the cool older kids. So we have to walk to the kitchen with him and this is when he asks us again, over and over. His mom is trying to say, no"" ill go swimming with you"". Eventually my mom (the 5-year old's grandma) just blows up at me and my girlfriend for ignoring him.  Saying how rude and he isnt stupid that he deserves a real answer. But the thing is, its very situational because if we did say no again, he would have thrown a fit and my mom and sister would be pissed at us for saying no. But if we said yes, than it would be a hassle for them to go swimming too. Also, we swam with him the day before, and it was around 7:30 pm when he asked us.
So reddit, what should i have done? This morning, the day after,  my mom is really blowing up about it.

Edit: she really blew up about it today but i told her that we already answered him in my room. She sort of quieted but she was still angry"	Not the A-hole	0	0

They never have been. Her sister spreads lies about the family and basically hates everyone and talks shit constantly. Her sister used to threaten to kill her as a teenager and openly admitted that she was mad when my wife was born. My wife is 6 years younger than her sister. 

Unfortunately, their dad passed away and we were obligated to meet with wife’s sister and her husband at the funeral. I noticed my brother in law never said a word to my wife and was intentionally avoiding her. He was not like that before but over the years her sister manipulated him into not liking my wife. 

It made me upset that my brother in law was ignoring my wife, the dad’s death was traumatic. 

After the service we all went to lunch and during the lunch my wife seemed sad and had mentioned to me in the car that she noticed he was ignoring her and thought it was rude that he didn’t acknowledge either me or her. During the lunch as we were eating, I confronted my brother in law in front of the entire family and asked why he was ignoring my wife. He got defensive and said I was an asshole and it caused a big scene to the point where we had to be separated and sat at different tables. Her sister also got involved and began cursing in front of about 50 people who attended the service. He also ignored us the rest of the time and left after the lunch and never said a word to us.

byafiz	2019-06-08 17:37:00	throwawayruby12	AITA for limiting my boyfriend's gaming to strictly 1hr/day?	"Throwaway. Mobile. Etc.

My boyfriend [32] and I [30] have been living together for 6 months. I've always known he's a gamer, mostly Overwatch that he plays with a bunch of friends online. I'm not into it. He has tried to get me into gaming but it's just not a hobby that stuck to me. Fair enough, we have plenty of other things we do enjoy together: Netflix, movies, mini golf, watching sport etc. 

We have different schedules. He has 3 jobs now cos he has to pay for a car he totalled, so his downtime is limited. I work 9-5, I cook and clean for him, and I help cover the occassional bill or rent portion when he's struggling. I don't mind letting him play his games every night cos it gives me some alone time, and I know he only plays when his friends are online so it's not like he spends hours per night playing Overwatch.

But then he discovered Magic the Gathering. 

Now he can play a single player game online without having to rely on his friends being there. He's on it every minute he's not at work, and our time together has dramatically been lost over the past month or so. He won't come to bed with me anymore: he's up til midnight, 2am, 4am playing MTG. It's all he can talk about too. Whenever I'm in the room he has to keep me posted about what gold/platinum stage he's on and the new card combos he's discovered. I've managed to keep from shouting 'I don't care' but I want to scream it. I try to steer the conversation elsewhere but he quickly stops contributing and goes back to his screen. If I try to talk to him at all he never raises his eyes. 

The last time we had sex was about three weeks ago, and that's pretty long for us. Afterwards I fell asleep and assumed he had too. I woke up hours later to see he was gone; he redressed and went back to the living room to continue playing MTG. I miss our intimacy a lot. I honestly blame this stupid game for ruining our sex life, because I'm genuinely beginning to believe he no longer has any interest in me as a sexual partner.

Recently I told him all this in the brief time that i had his attention one morning. I told him I think his obsession with MTG is getting between us spending time together. I honestly feel invisible living in the same house as him. I wanted to lay down a house rule of 1hr of game time per day. I even threatened to cut the internet off after an hour to keep him to a strict time limit. 

He snapped at me, said I was taking away something so small that was giving him a lot of joy; his work has been causing him a lot of stress and he had no other way to relax. When I mentioned how he hasn't come to bed with me for weeks, his response was that not everyone has a bedtime and has to be up by 7, and since his work hours are more erratic he should be able to stay up as long as he wants. I don't want to act like his damn mother, but I'm becoming stupidly lonely. I can't see a better way to break his obsession other than limiting his internet access.

byaf6i	2019-06-08 17:36:10		AITA for killing a teammate in bo3 after he was an ass to me	So I was playing hardcore tdm in bo3, and in one game I was doing pretty good and a guy on the other team kept calling me out. I had headphones on but the wire was a knockoff so the mic didn’t work. I could hear his girl talking smack in the background too. So after the match was done, my team won. And the next game, we were on the same team. So next game starts, I’m doing good, not better than the first game but still had a better kd than him, and he’s still talking shit about me, just me. Saying why I’m not doing as well as the last game and he wants to 1v1 me and beat my ass. And I get annoyed, cause I’m not one to interact with people. So at one point I saw that he died and I’m thinkin “igh, hardcore has friendly fire so imma kill him once just to piss him off even more” and that’s exactly what I do. So I do it, AND THEY GO OFF, BOTH OF THEM. It was honestly the funniest shit cause the guy sounded black but his girl straight up sounded like white trash. I thought he was gonna do it to me, but he ain’t do shit. So after that game (we won), he left and I hit him up w a “why you mad tho.” Never got a reply :(		1	0

Throughout the course of the year Monica and I worked very hard to design our weekly experiments for the club while Jessica would always wait until the night before and sometimes forgot to prepare them at all and instead made the  club play Kahoot.

So as the end of the year came around I asked her to run for treasurer and for me to take the presidency from her. She refused and instead suggested that everyone just keeps their current positions. So in the end we decided to hold an election and one of my friends would run for treasurer in my place, although he rarely comes to science club."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Long time lurker first time poster.

I ran into this woman I used to know in college. Only—I didn’t remember who she was until she left. She called me out by name. And I didn’t realize who she was until I saw a very distinctive tattoo on the back of her ankle that she had gotten for/with me when we were 17.

I have no idea how I could have forgotten about this girl. I only knew her for a couple of weeks at university but during that time she was my everything. I want to say she could have been my first love- but would I have been able to block her out?

I have not thought about this girl in about two decades. But now I can’t get her out of my mind. Am I the asshole for forgetting her? She obviously remembered me. And she still had the tattoo.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: I know, I know everyone hates edits but I am getting a lot of DMs asking was the tattoo was. It is a tattoo of the freckles that go across my nose and onto my cheeks. She had it put on the back of her Achilles.

&#x200B;

Edit 2:  Ok, Ok. I know love might be a strong word for this but let me explain a little more. We were both freshman at university and living away from home for the first time. She was magical. Listened to the same music, played the same video games, read the same books, loved the same sports. And we had a super hot and heavy 2-3 weeks together and then she was just gone. I remember her being really sick and meeting her Dad who drove to from SC to NC to meet her at the ER. Then I just remember going to her room the next day and she was gone."	Not enough info	0	0

byad1r	2019-06-08 17:30:34	Guygenius138	AITA for telling my mom not to visit this summer?	"Ok, I moved from Texas to Oregon three years ago, and haven't seen my mom in 5 years. We rarely talk on the phone, not because I don't love her, I just am not a phone talker.

She recently received from money from a medical settlement and planned to do some travelling. We first discussed her coming here for one week, starting July 1st, as this would allow me to have July 4th off from work, as well as the following weekend. She called me to ask if she could stay longer, and I offered 10 days, but she pushed for two weeks. I clearly indicated that I thought that was too long, and even she said ""I know fish and company stink after three days."" But I still agreed, because she's my mom.

Well, before coming to Oregon, she was going to travel to Germany to visit her brother. During her layover at JFK, she missed the last step off the plane, fell and hit her head. Got a black eye and such. She continued her flight, but was very tired and jetlagged upon arrival. After a few days, she started to feel better and did some sightseeing with my uncle and his wife. Then she decided to go off on her own one day, and proceeded to fall off a curb and hit her head again. She ended up in the hospital, with an infection in the glands in her face that swelled her up really good. Then they discovered another infection and a weak heart valve. She was isolated and has been in the hospital for over two weeks. They even discovered a kidney issue yesterday. She still has not been released.

She sent me a message this week, stating she still planned to travel to Oregon when she returned to the states. But now she planned to stay from June 25th to July 13th. I wrote her and stated that was too long, as my wife just started a new job this week, and I might start a new job next week. We cannot take any time off, except July 4th. She stated she would rent a car and get herself around, but she is a terrible driver. I will not allow my daughter to be driven around by her. Of course this hurt her feelings. But mom has been on prescription drugs for over 30 years and over medicates herself because she is a former nurse and thinks she knows better. Both of my sister's, who live in ckose proximity to her, agree she is a terrible driver, and should not be travelling so soon after arriving back home. In fact, she still has no firm date to be released from care in Germany. I did indicate in my messages that I am very concerned for her health, and we should postpone her trip until she feels better.

Sorry if post is rambling. Written word is not my strong suit.

Edit 1: We haven't seen each other in five years only because neither of us could afford to travel to see the other."	No A-holes here	0	0
byaccp	2019-06-08 17:28:51	rugsnatcher57	AITA For cheering on friends in video game matches against my bf at the time?	"This was a recurring issue in a past relationship, and I've never asked for outside opinions on it so I'm interested. TLDR at bottom.

Context: I am 1 of 4 siblings, video games were a big bonding experience and alliances were made and broken in the name of fun and competition. Ex loves video games too, has an older brother. Brought my GameCube into this relationship.

Multiple times when my ex (then bf) and I had friends over, he would invite them to play SSBM. He was pretty good at the game, I mean neither of us are pro level, but he often was better than me and definitely the best of our regular friends. Our friends would often get beat and lose interest in playing, so I would cheer them on (against BF) and on rare occasion team up with them against him.

I think my ex honestly relished in winning against our friends, some of whom were first time players. I think twice I actually chided him for it, albeit in a joking manner, while our friends were over. It was all fun and games afaic, but the fun was lessened when it's just one guy wailing on everyone.

At some point, I think about 2 years in our relationship, my ex told me he considers it a betrayal and/or me trying to put him down when I cheer for our friends against him as well as when i chided him. The chiding I can concede, it was too much, but I don't see the cheering that way even now. His view was that I should always have his back, and what I was doing undermined our relationship in front of everyone and made me seem spiteful. 

It felt hollow cheering for him every time when he's already winning. I'm just not the kind of girl who can authentically do a celebratory kiss and bring you a drink and he knew that about me; I'm a bad actor. Especially hard to when you obliterate some people who have been playing the game a total of 30 minutes, it just felt like it wasn't even fun anymore. But I tried, I only cheered for friends when he wasn't playing, I made sure to say he was playing well.

He continued to bring this up though, actually saying I enjoyed seeing him down. We dated for 3.5 years, and he similarly got upset when I sided with his friend on what movie to watch while he was staying with us. His main issue was that I did these things in front of others, and that made him or our relationship (unsure which?) look weak, like I was disrespecting him. Ofc I loved him and it wasn't my intention, and I never was against him publicly in any other contexts, regardless of our disagreements.

TL;DR I liked to cheer on friends in video game matches against my bf b/c he always won anyways. He said it made our relationship look weak and that I was trying to put him down, that I did these things to be spiteful.

So, was I the a-hole for cheering/ promoting competition against my ex? Was it actually me undermining him and I'm dense af or what?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
byabwy	2019-06-08 17:27:36	Ocatarina	AITA for putting this guy on blast because he was putting his items on the conveyor belt before I was done putting mine on there?	Mind you, my items weren’t far along on the conveyor belt yet. I had just started putting them on it and I had to wait for it to keep moving to put more things on it when the guy behind me started putting his stuff on what little space I had. Where I live the cashier will check your items really fast so it’s already a stressful experience because you want to be done putting everything on it before she starts checking your items or you’ll hold up the line. So I told him “Sir, I still have a lot of items to put on here” and he said “It’s okay, you’ll be able to put them”. But as soon as a little bit of space freed up he’d start putting his things on there again! I asked him why he was doing that and told him that the cashier wouldn’t be able to check his items before she had done mine anyways and he started complaining loudly saying that I was exaggerating. So I told him he was being rude and should be ashamed of himself. He kept complaining and held his things back so someone else could be between us, and then he complained to that person, too. He kept saying that “young people aren’t as nice as old people” (he looked around mid-forties) and kept taunting to get my attention but I ignored him. I really don’t like confrontation so I feel guilty for even saying anything since I didn’t want to make a scene.	Not the A-hole	0	0
byabn5	2019-06-08 17:26:55	JettDash	AITA for refusing to pay a debt collector money that I owe them?	"So a while back I had a couple thousand dollars on a credit card and I couldn't make the payments after losing my job. Eventually, they sold the debt to some debt collector. The debt collectors obviously tried to contact me. But I pretty much just ignored them. If they managed to get me on the phone, I hung up when I realized who it was. I was broke and frankly I didn't give a shit about them losing money on this.

Anyway, eventually they sued me. I didn't bother going to court because I didn't have a defense and figured there was no difference between a default judgment and the judge ruling against me in person.

Anyway, I am now in a financial position where I could pay off the judgment fairly quickly if I wanted to. But I am not going to do that. I would rather just keep it. I give zero shits if that means that some debt collection company is out the money. They knew it was a high risk investment when they bought the debt. Oh well.

As far as I am aware, they would need to know where I bank to get money that way, so I am not too worried about that. And I work as an independent contractor, and I'm pretty sure they can't garnish those earnings.

Anyway, they will never get a dime of my money unless they find a way to take it against my will. AITA because of this?"	Asshole	0	0

byaa96	2019-06-08 17:23:09	DundieAllstar	"WIBTA if I ""told"" on a colleague for stealing another colleague's course and selling it to people as if it were their own course?"	"I'm using the word colleague, but I'm not sure what we are. We are all self-published writers in a genre that makes a lot of money, and we're self-employed but share a lot of information and tips in private online groups and what not. We all work from home so we feel like colleagues. The only way to make a ton of money self publishing is to use Facebook ads to promote our books, and well, that's a hard skill to learn. 

&#x200B;

This one author (I'll call her Angela) jumped on the writing scene last year, started doing Facebook ads, and really shot up the best selling charts and was making good money (meaning around $200,000 a year). Everyone wanted to know how, she she  set up a paid course online and charged $800 to teach people how to run Facebook ads the way she does them. It was open to anyone who wants to sign up - and it's still open now, there's no limit on who can sign up. I took this class. 

&#x200B;

Now, a few months later, other seasoned author who has been publishing and doing ads for years and years, (I'll call her Pam) makes over a million dollars a year and contributes her success to Facebook ads. She set up her own course a year ago and taught a small number of people, and then recently opened it up again only to an exclusive number of people. Not just anyone can sign up for this class- there's a limit to how many she'll give the ""Secret sauce"" to, otherwise the competition would be insane and it wouldn't be profitable to run ads anymore. She charges $1000 and she's very hands on and detailed and has a specific method for her ads and analyzation and it's very in depth. To sum up - Pam knows her stuff. She's amazing. She has fantastic advice. I took this class. Angela did, too.  


The day the class started, Angela posted to her private course group that she's ""so excited she's taking Pam's class and can't wait to tell us what she learns"" - I immediately thought this would be wrong if she essentially steals Pam's method and shows the ""Secret sauce"" to her class.   


Well... that's what she did. A week later, she updated her own course with new videos and instructions and it's literally the EXACT method from Pam's class. Pam's method is 100% different from Angela's original method. They don't overlap at all. Had I never taken Pam's paid course, then I would have still learned the exact same thing from waiting for Angela to take the class and then update her class with all that she learned.  


I want to anonymously tell Pam what happened. Maybe Pam won't care, or maybe she will, but I think she should know. My husband says I should absolutely tell he. My writer friends (who took Angela's course but couldn't afford to also take Pam's, are saying I'd be TA because Angela can share whatever she learns with her students, and it doesn't matter where she learns it from. I think she's stealing proprietary information and profiting off it. My regular non-publishing friends said I'm sticking my nose where it doesn't belong and should mind my own business.

I was shocked and yet he did nothing. As he went to leave I said ""Excuse me"" in quite a loud and blunt tone. 

He turned around and I asked him if he was going to apologise. He had the audacity to ask what for. 

For farting on our table and all he said was that he is old and cannot control his bowels. 

I admit I replied quite harshly but basically said being old doesn't excuse manners regardless whether he can or cannot control his bowels. It still rude to fart on someones table and not say anything.

bya8z8	2019-06-08 17:19:44	Aenorath	AITA for my boss having to do my delivery shift?	"Bit of pretext, I work two delivery jobs. One is mattress delivery for a local company, and the other is a well known food delivery service that pays a lot better, but has a wonky schedule. When I first got the mattress job, I told them about the food delivery and how they have weird schedules, and they were 100 percent okay with it. I've also got a daughter who lives with the other parent. 

&#x200B;

Alright, onto the AITA! The way my mattress job works is that they release a weekly schedule that goes like (imagine a chart) Monday (Adam and Joey) Tuesday (Adam and Josh), etc. Everyone knows what day they work, assuming that there are deliveries. Then, there's a daily schedule posted the day before the delivery day. If there are no deliveries, there's no work that day. The schedule is posted to a facebook group.

&#x200B;

The way that the food delivery works is that you pray to a deity or the universe for work, and then you check the app. If there's work, you schedule yourself and you're golden.

&#x200B;

I was scheduled for today (Saturday) on the weekly, and I'd been checking the facebook group all day to see when I work. I checked google multiple times to verify that the store closes for business at 7pm. I checked at 7, then 720, then 730, and so on and so forth. 9pm comes around, 2 hours past close of business, so I jump onto my delivery app and find the perfect food delivery schedule, I can't believe my eyes. I got a glourious 12pm to 7pm, which works all the better because I need to pick up my daughter at 10. My girlfriend had already said she'd get her, but she and my ex wife don't get on too well, but this worked out awesome.

&#x200B;

At 930, two hours after, the scheduler posts the schedule for today. It's a hell of a busy day. The second I see it, I post that I've got other obligations since the schedule wasn't posted until I was laying in bed. I wouldn't have even known about the workday if I hadn't checked one last time. SCH (scheduler) comes back and say that I need to cancel my shift and get my girlfriend to pick up my daughter. I get pissed, but don't reply until I've calmed a bit, and said that they didn't post it in a timely manner and that I didn't know if I was going to make money for my family, so I made the decision to guarantee some money, as well as spend much needed time with my daughter. I then text the one other driver (three of us), but he's busy. SCH doesn't like that and says that it's my responsibility to wait as long as it takes to find out when my mandatory shift for the mattress delivery is. While I can empathise with that, I'm not at the company to make friends and help out, I'm there for a paycheck. SCH then tags the two owners and says (quoting) 'well I guess boss1 and boss2 will cover for you.' Boss1 takes the shift.

bya7fe	2019-06-08 17:15:33		AITA for not refusing to tell my girlfriend about my kink?	"I (25M) have been with my girlfriend (23F) for around 18 months. It’s by far the longest and best relationship either of us hav been in, and while neither of us are really thinking about marriage at this point in our lives, I definitely see a future together.

Both of us are naturally very shy people, especially when it comes to sex. She says a lot that I’m very repressed, which is probably true. But we’ve been working on it, and we’ve both gotten better and being open and honest about our needs and over the course of our relationship, our sex life has gotten way better as a result.

Here’s the issue: last night we were talking about “kinks” or “fetishes,” something that’s come up in passing before but never directly. I told her “yes,” which is true, but that I'd prefer not to tell her what they are. She was frustrated with me, saying our relationship and sex life are based on openness, and that she wouldn't judge me, etc.

Here’s the thing: I have a pretty strong incest kink. I want to clarify that this has *nothing* to do with my actual family (gross) and everything to do with the taboo/forbidden nature of it and the idea of doing something “wrong” and risking getting caught being sexually exciting to me. (Maybe has something to do with me being repressed!) I don’t think this kink is necessarily terribly rare, given the type of porn that’s popular of late, but I also think my interest in it is unusually strong, seeing as it represents almost all of the erotica I view.

I don’t think this makes me a monster, but I do think it’s pretty weird, and a lot of people would see it as such. I’m a pretty normal guy otherwise – decent job, kind of shy, fairly typical hobbies for a dude in his mid-20s, good relationship with my actual family. I just think that for both of our sakes, I should stay quiet about this. She's pretty vanilla and I doubt she shares my kink, and it would be perfectly reasonable for her to view it as creepy or perverse. I also don't want to put her in a position where she feels like she has to play along with it for the sake of exciting me.

She's still frustrated that I won't open up to her, and thinks it's unreasonable that I'm being so closed-off. AITA?"		1	0

We are still friends and text each other from time to time, but we no longer interact socially unless it's a wedding of one of our mutual friends or something along those lines. She got engaged last year and I got engaged this month. To add context to the dynamic of our friendship, she told me about her engagement before posting it on social media as a courtesy so I wasn't blindsided by the news and I did the same for her. I haven't seen or talked to any of her family or friends since we broke up. I think she knows that I wouldn't attend her wedding because it would be uncomfortable and awkward, but she is the type of person who would send me an invitation anyway as a courtesy. I'm sure that if I did the same, she would decline as well, but I don't want to take the risk of her actually accepting the invitation.	Not the A-hole	1	0

He purchased a large home and has lots of animals. A dog, a pygmy goat, waterfowl including geese and ducks, and I think a single chicken made it through the winter lol. Oh and a lizard of some kind, bearded dragon I think. But the worst pet he has is an Umbrella Cockatoo. This bird is a fucking JUNGLE GOBLIN that can screech so loud you feel your ear drums start to revolt. If you ignore him it just gets louder. I would also be expected to groundskeep. Mowing, watering and pruning a huge yard.. So over the last year or so he would ask me to house sit for a night and pay me 50 bucks. It happened a handful of times. He came up with the amount, as I didn't know what was fair. 

So he has a trip planned that will keep him away for the entire month of June, and he asked if I would watch the house at the agreed upon price of 50 bucks a day. Right before he left he tried to lower the price to $25 a day and if it weren't for the bird I would have. I refused and we settled on $40 a day as long as it's as clean as he wants. 

He called me the other night and picked a fight, saying that I'm a gold digging friend who only hangs around him for his money. That a true friend would house sit for free. And he asked would I be helping if he didn't have money. I said if he didn't have money he wouldn't have a mansion and a farm to take care of and I probably WOULD do it as a favor. As it is, its quite a bit of work and my current SO hates the bird too, so they won't even come visit me while I'm here. So my question to you, am I the asshole for knowing my worth and charging to house sit? Or am I actually out of line and a gold digging friend? I truly love this friend and it breaks my heart he would see things that way. TIA"	Not the A-hole	0	0

by9zum	2019-06-08 16:56:17		AITA for telling my neighbor a story I heard from her HR?	"So this is a bit complicated and confusing but I live in a community where 2/3’s of the residents work for the same major corporation (my family is in the 1/3 and in no way employed by this company) , let’s pretend it’s Starbucks because the employee levels work similarly.

Emma and I have kids similar ages and use the same preschool and our husbands get a long REALLY well. I have had a few uncomfortable situations with Emma about things that I did not like 1. I think she overshares information especially if they are “against” her and she has told me both times she won’t remove the information and “people should know what others are saying about them” 2. Was super personal to me, she laughed out loud while saying she sends pork into our religious school (this is absolutely against the rules-also note she does not practice this religion). I actually addressed this one and I told her it was very offensive, she better stop or I will report her myself and I did not find anything she said to be funny. Since then I have taken a step back from her, I do not need her as a friend but I am always nice and still invite them to our “parties” but I definitely don’t actively engage her.  

A couple of weeks ago we had one of our get togethers and Emma came with her family, Val and hers did not show up. I did wind up in a circle with Emma and two other neighbors where she told a story about a meeting with Val and one of her co-workers who were turned down for something (wasn’t specific) and the coworker went nuts, made a scene was crying etc. Now I get that Val wasn’t exactly who the story was about but the only way Val and Emma would have a meeting together is because she was denied a promotion or transfer.  I didn’t want to make a scene so I decided to just walk away. A few days later myself, Val and one other neighbor from the circle were outside and neighbor made a comment about how everyone working for Starbucks is crazy and Emma confirmed it with her story. Val asked what he was talking about and said “I have never met her off the block in my life and ESPECIALLY not at work” neighbor left and Val asked me for more detail so I told her what I heard. 

A few days later Val sent me a picture of Emma on Starbucks’ intranet server saying “Is this our neighbor?” I replied “Yes, are you reporting her?” Val never answered. A few days after that she told me she did file a report but was told it’s hearsay and nothing can be done but a note was made. That same night Emma’s husband bumped into my husband while walking our dogs and was very strange with my husband. My husband did his best to find out what was wrong and all Emma’s husband could say was “I’m sure it’s just drama but I can’t talk about it now... maybe next week” of course my husband told me and we assume this MUST be what it is about and that Emma is in trouble.

by9zns	2019-06-08 16:55:49		AITA for telling my gay friend I'd rather be gay	"Firstly, I live in India and being gay is still a taboo here.

Last week, one my friends came out of the closet and told me he was gay. He only told me and no one else. He is my first and only gay friend as of now. So I told him that we should celebrate and took him out. 

As we were talking he told me that I should look for a girl too. I responded, ""I'd rather be gay than be in a committed relationship with a woman"".

{{
Might sound gay but hear me out. Throughout my life I've seen failed relationships. My own parents don't love each other. They're still together because divorce is also a taboo here (especially for the woman). I've had a classmate who almost drank rat poison because of a break up. My cousin has been cheated on by his wife. I know all women are not the same but I don't think I'm strong enough to go through something like this. 
}}

So as soon as I said this, my friend was fuming. He said, ""You can't just say that. It's not how homosexuality works. It's not just a gender you can fall back upon if you hate the opposite sex. It's not a dumpster"".

I might have worded it wrong but that's not what I meant. He's really pissed and hasn't talked to me ever since. 

I also had no prior experience with homosexual people so I don't know if that was actually offensive. I might sound like an idiot but I really am that clueless about homosexuality. I'm trying my best to make them feel comfortable but I seem to have screwed it up in my first attempt. 

Also, not trying to defame my country in any way. It's just how it is. The situation has improved in the urban areas but that makes up a very less percentage of the total population. 

So, finally I'd like to know if what I said was actually offensive and asshole-ish

by9vc7	2019-06-08 16:44:31		AITA For wanting to rehome one of my family's dogs?	"10 years ago, my parents rescued a small dog. He got along well with everyone, and things basically weren’t an issue at all. 

Maybe three years later, my family decided to get another dog. 

A couple of years after that, my brother and sister decided to get an energetic terrier.

Having three dogs roaming around the house led to accidents everywhere. All constantly marking territory and destroying things throughout. Eventually, this led my family to keeping all three dogs in crates in the kitchen whenever they weren’t outside. 

Night-time it’s the crate. The afternoon, morning- virtually any time they aren’t outside they’re in the crate. 

They bark non-stop, incessantly at almost everything. A knock on the door, a noise in the house. The doorbell will send all three of them into a howling/screaming/barking fit while they’re in their cages because they aren’t trained. 

They don’t get walked/played with every day, they don’t get treats, all attempts at training have gone completely out the window. My family would ignore me when I brought this up. 

When I bring up rehoming to my brother, he tells me that I’m contributing to the problem because I don’t help train them, and that if I hate their situation so much that I should be actively trying to fix it instead of complaining. “They’re family animals so stop complaining and making it worse.” He says that I “spend all day in the attic and only come downstairs to eat, so how would I even know.” Even though I’ve been home working/going to community college while he’s been away for years at a private college. He says that he thinks they live happy lives, and that there’s nothing wrong with what is happening because they “spend all day outside.”

1. They don’t spend all day outside. During the winter and summer, they might spend a total of three or four collective hours outside- the weather just doesn’t allow for it. Honestly, I’m not a dog expert at all, but even if they did spend all day outside, I really don’t think that’d be an okay/ideal situation anyway. 

2. I never had any say in purchasing any of these dogs. Not the animal or their name. I literally wasn’t present for the purchase of any of them. I’m not a dog person, and I think it’s unfair to say this is my responsibility when I had zero say in any of this. 

My family is now okay with the idea except for my brother, who immediately gets upset and refuses to discuss it.

He says that he’ll train them/spend more time with them and make things different. Considering that this has been the status quo for the last 4+ years and that he’s said this before, I’m seriously doubtful. And while we all sit around and argue about it, the dogs are the ones that suffer spending day after day in cages. 

AITA? Is this somehow my responsibility/is it actually okay for the dogs to be living like this? I really just don’t know what to do at this point but the situation feels seriously gross."	Not the A-hole	1	0

by9rub	2019-06-08 16:35:09	Ballstrangler69	AITA for not caring if my neighbor is annoyed by our dogs?	"My wife and I live in a relatively quiet neighborhood in a major metropolitan area. This is a up and coming neighborhood, where houses are reasonably nice, in a reasonably desired area, so this is not a very fancy neighborhood. We have two dogs (beagle 1yr and hound mix 7 yrs) and a fenced in back yard. Our dogs, being both hounds are relatively loud, and when the beagle gets excited, she runs around in the back making this excited yelping noise usually no longer than 1-2 min. They also bark at passersby and the neighbor when she is out in her back yard (through a wooden fence). When they are barking across the fence they are wagging their tails and appear to want to play with the other dog. When my wife and I are getting home from work or leaving they get very excited and will yelp or bark a bit as we are coming up the driveway. Whenever they start to bark, we either let them inside if we are not outside or go over to them to try and quiet them. We do not leave them outside when we are not home and usually the barking is no longer than 15-30 seconds depending on the situation. On usual days they are not left outside for more than 2 hours or so at a time and we do everything we can to keep them quiet at night. The beagle can get excited when we let her out before bed, but in general after 9 or so there is no barking. We have been planted a lot of plants and made the backyard very pleasant to sit in and frequently sit back there with both of the dogs.

&#x200B;

Our neighbor has a dog, who is ""dog-aggressive"" and apparently frightened of other dogs as well. She feels that she cannot take her dog out into her back yard while our dogs are in ours due to him being scared of our dogs barking at him across the fence. We have suggested letting them meet, but the neighbor does not think her dog would be friendly to ours. Our neighbor and my wife text and she complains about our dogs all the time and also yells at our dogs to shut up across the fence. She suggested getting them bark collars that spray citronella when they bark. We did that and it worked for all of about 1 week before they decided that wasn't enough of a deterrant and started ignoring it. My wife tries to look out our bathroom window to ensure that the neighbor isn't in her backyard before letting our dogs out. Now the neighbor has asked us to make a schedule for when our dogs can go outside. My wife and I have irregular schedules and that would be challenging, but honestly I think it is kind of ridiculous and I don't think we need to.

&#x200B;

I do not think we need to do anything more, we have tried to work with her and we are definitely not breaking any noise violations. We can hear dogs all over the neighborhood barking at all hours of the day, so its not like we are the only house with dogs. I'm sorry that it annoys the neighbor, but I don't think we are doing anything wrong. AITA for thinking this?"	Asshole	0	0

They want to not only visit their son, but also see me as well. My Bf’s parents told us that they were coming for 4 nights. However, only 2 days before they were coming, he called his sister to wish her a happy birthday, and on that phone call his sister implied that she was coming to stay as well. He was completely shocked and then called his mom to ask her if that's true. His mom confirmed. Given that our space is small, having an additional person really is a big deal. Because i want to maintain a good relationship, I think its best if i find another place to stay. I am a very introverted person and need my space or i might lose it and damage our relationship.

by9qoj	2019-06-08 16:32:05	SpiralEater	AITA for admittedly poorly planning out a spa day for my wife?	"My wife's birthday was this week, but we didn't get to do much for it because of how busy we are. I'm currently working 7 days - 12 hours a day so I didn't have time to do anything with her. She's also been pretty busy taking care of our kids, and doing the sports and stuff.

Anywho, I figured she could use a break, and I need to make up for her birthday anyway. So I planned for my mother to pick the kids up from her, and made a $230 appointment for a three hour session for a massage, spa, facial, and whatever else they do. I got the nicest package they have.

Well, I knew my son had a game, but I didn't realize how late it was going to run. So she started to go on about how now she has to rush to get to my mom on time, and she probably won't even enjoy the spa because she's going to be annoyed.

Okay. Fine, I guess. I tell her it'll be okay. She won't be close to being late for the appointment, and I'll let my mom know she might be running late. My mom wouldn't, and didn't mind. 

She then calls me to ask me why I didn't tell her where my mom was taking the kids. She was taking them to my sisters friends party. I said I didn't think it was important. They're only going to be there for an hour, and I didn't think it would be an issue. She started going off about how now she has to bathe the kids again, and I always plan things poorly, and I should have told her everything.

Admittedly, I should have thought about how long his game might be. My kids are always bathed tho. They're not gross, or anything. Also, if your kid is in baseball they're expected to be dirty after a game? He's five. He's supposed to be dirty. My mom isn't trying to impress these people, and we don't even know them. My mom doesn't even want to be there, but she doesn't want them to not come to my sisters thing.

Anyway, getting off topic. I'll shorten this up. I said she needs to just relax, and it'll be fine. She kept going off. I also admittedly got shitty at this point, and said I just shouldn't have bothered, I guess. Or something along those lines. She hung up, and texted me to just cancel the appointment. Said she's not going. I won't get my money back, mind you. The appointment is in a couple hours. I'll probably just tell a friend to go enjoy themselves if she doesn't go.

TL;DR, didn't do anything for wife's birthday because work, got her a pricey three our spa day, she says I made the plans poorly, went off on me, and said to just cancel it even though I won't get my money back.

I’m not sure if he has some genital itch or something.

I’m really desperate for extra money and I knew that if I disclosed that I would be leaving by August 6 that my chances of being hired would be zero to none.

The reason I didn’t disclose this information was because the last job interview I had (nanny), the lady had hired me knowing I would be leaving in August and then days before I started, she texted me saying she found someone else long term. Fearing this would happen again, I refrained from telling the manager I would be leaving by August. 

I told a few people that I didn’t tell the manager that I would be leaving and they’re just like, “why didn’t you tell them??”.

I currently work for a small production based company. I was supposed to deal with the Finances, but was stuck in production owing to staff shortages. My colleague, Bob, who started a few weeks earlier is in a similar position, though he was Sales & Marketing. 

After a few months, owners/managers suddenly announce they're leaving the business to start a new one. Bob & I are to be left in charge of everything. They want to have nothing to do with the business, other than a collective £250/week payment. (£13k/year)

Bob & I finally get to look at the companies finances. We're royally screwed & the business would've failed with the owners at the helm within weeks as they withdrew copiously large amounts of money.

However, we can see the potential in the business & without them withdrawing cash all the time, it'd actually be profitable. As we couldn't afford to set up a rival company, we decide to have a go at it with this company.

Business reasonably successful. Over two years, we hire 4 additional production staff, Bob & I going to our actual roles. We're not hugely profitable, still paying the debts of the owners, but we're in a good place & reasonably self-sustaining. We pay at least national living wage, have a pension scheme, monthly bonuses, staff evenings etc. Pretty decent place to work (I think anyway)

Bob leaves owing to personal illness, though still visits to check up on us.

Owners suddenly turn up & try to reintegrate themselves into the business \[as new venture collapsed\]. *They now want £20k/year each as wages, plus ""unlimited withdrawals"" to pay their new debts.*

Despite my obvious objections, they do whatever the fudge they like because owners - though I do a fair amount of damage mitigation, I can't stop everything.

Business cannot support them, if it could, I'd have spent their wages on a new staff member before they came back. Owners are totally useless, no department wants them.

&#x200B;

My quandary is that I want to leave the business before it fails, but also want to do right to the production team I hired. If I tell them I'm looking for new work, and they should too, the owners will find out (as they get on well socially with production team, and they're pretty gossip-y). Owners take it personally when staff quit, and make life unbearably difficult. But if I don't tell the team until I hand in my notice (4 weeks), they may not have the time to find new work before inevitable collapse. Yes, we have a government benefits system, but some live paycheck-to-paycheck & the benefits would only just keep them afloat.

I feel like I need to tell the production team, just it seems like the decent thing to do. But, yet, I can't without putting myself at risk of being fired/forced out without having a new job lined up. I know it's selfish to hide my intentions, but AITA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

"I met my wife when we were in college, (from the UK, think high school if you’re from the US), at the age of 17. We both fell very hard for each other. We were young, and idiots, and I accidentally got her pregnant.

Everyone around us, including our parents, told us parenting was great, and that we were such strong people that we could do it. So, we decided to keep the baby. We had a beautiful little girl, and we loved her with all our hearts. 

However, we were 18 at the time. We had no money, were struggling to get jobs, and we had no idea how difficult a kid would be. Our parents turned sour once the baby was born, telling us we were stupid and they wouldn’t help us. After 7 months of struggling financially and mentally, we put our wonderful daughter up for adoption, and she was taken from us.

I don’t like to think or talk about this time. As you can imagine it was the worst thing in the world, I never have and never will go through anything worse, but we knew she deserved a better life than we could give her. The family did not want to tell her she was adopted until she was much older, so we haven’t seen or heard from our baby girl since then. We got through it together.

We are both 29 now. We both redid our A levels, went to uni, married at 24, and are now financially stable and own a house together. Last night I decided to ask her if she thought she wanted to have children with me.

It went 0-100 real quick. She screamed and she sobbed. She told me I was a horrible, horrible man and how could I even suggest having kids after what happened. I told her I understood it was difficult to think of, but it has been a while, and we are equipped to be parents now, but she insisted that I was a dickhead for even suggesting we “replace” our daughter.

by9juw	2019-06-08 16:13:43		AITA for cancelling my tattoo appointment?	"I scheduled this tattoo appointment 3 months ago. It’s a pretty big piece, and I was feeling really great about it originally. 
As it’s gotten closer and closer to the appointment (it’s now a month away) I’ve been panicking about the price. The tattoo is going to be over $500. 
At first, I was worried about the price, then not liking the design the artist comes up with, then I realized that I just don’t feel anything for the concept anymore. 

I’ve been feeling this way about the tattoo for around a month now, but I’ve shrugged it off and tried to tell myself that I still want it. 

I’m still thinking about maybe just asking him to adjust the design and lowering my budget, but I’m leaning towards just canceling the appointment. $500 is a lot to spend on a tattoo that you’re unsure of, especially when it’s gonna cover a large portion of my arm. 

He hasn’t drawn out the design yet, and like I’ve said, it’s a whole month away. I’m sure he’ll be keeping the deposit so I feel like that covers any of his time so far.

by9ird	2019-06-08 16:10:46		AITA for not specifying my gender,even though I was never asked?	"First of all, I’d like to wish everyone a happy and safe pride month!TL;DR on the bottom.

This is my first time posting here, so please excuse any mistakes.Additionally, as English is not my first language, I apologise in advance for any potential grammar/spelling errors.

To begin with, I am a cis female.I don’t dress extremely femininely, but I don’t dress masculinely either.My body, however, can be considered quite masculine; I have broader shoulders, high and deep cheekbones (idk how to accurately describe them, think the Johnny Depp kind of cheekbones) and a sharper jawline.My chest is relatively small and my body is overall toned and muscular, as I do enjoy frequent workouts.

So, a couple days ago, a group of friends of mine and I decided to go to a gay bar, since most of us are gay/bi (I am bi).Plus, there was a drag show scheduled for that day -something we all enjoy- so the two straight girls of the group didn’t mind joining.The night was overall incident-free, until a guy started approaching me and asked me whether I’d like to dance with him.At first I was not really in the mood, however I just went along with it since it could be fun, and the reason why I went out on the first place was to have a good time.
I was tipsy (I am aware of my limits) but he was visibly drunker, but not completely out of it.One thing led to the other and we soon found ourselves in one of the bathroom stalls, very turned on and intensively making out.He slid his hand into my jeans and got visibly disturbed in a matter of seconds.He almost immediately pulled it out and just stared at me for a while.I asked him whether something was wrong and he responded with “Well yes, you didn’t say you’re a woman”.I almost thought he was joking, but then asked him why he thought that I was not one.Long story short, in his drunken state I looked like a “very hot crossdresser” so he just “went for it”.I apologised for the confusion, however I insisted that, had he asked, I would had specified my gender, so it was mostly his fault for just assuming shit in the first place.He just told me to fuck off and left.

So AITA in this situation?

TL;DR:Some guy at a gay bar assumed I was a crossdresser, never asked for a specification and got pissed when he found out I wasn’t one.

EDIT:Wow, this got way more attention than I originally thought it would.I would like to thank you all for taking the time to read it and comment on it.I apologise for not being able to respond to everyone though.

So, I would like to clarify something ; I didn’t think I was at fault in this situation and neither did the majority of my friends.Nevertheless, since one of my friends thought that it was partly my fault as well, I really wanted to see with whom a third party would agree more.

I understand that sometimes our actions can come out as insensitive and rude, even though our intentions weren’t such.Especially in a community where some people are still shy/embarrassed/judged.Having read all your opinions now, I still think there’s not something I could had done different, although - in any future interactions - I will try to be a little more clear about myself.

Also, I am using the term “gay bar” a little loosely ; as in a bar for gay people (not just men) , LGBTQ+ people in general, even straight people who just felt like joining.

Again,thank you all for taking time to judge me.Oh and btw, thanks for teaching me how to properly type lol.I am more of a pen and paper girl, so typing long texts was never really my forte."	Not the A-hole	0	0
by9irb	2019-06-08 16:10:46	WhosThis85	AITA for not serving my friends the same food i was eating?	Well, last sunday me and my girl decided to make sunday dinner, we decided on cabbage with sausage, mac n cheese, salmon, green bean. She decided to cook all that for me. She said she would make enough food to last us a few days into the week for lunch as well. I was hungry while she started cooking, so i cooked two sweet chili chicken leg quarters to hold me over. While all this was going on, my homeboy hit me to see if i was going to watch the raptors/golden state game later that night. I told him i was and i decided to invite him and his wife over. I wanted to introduce them to my girlfriend because they havent met yet. I also told them we were making food so they can join us to eat as well. So while the chicken i was making was cooking, i also decided to make rice and broccoli. Me and my girlfriend decided that we will serve them the chicken, rice and broccoli because that was finished first and the cabbage, fish and green bean was ours for the week. Once my friends came over to watch the game and eat, we served them the chicken with the sides. My friends wife wasnt hungry because she said she already ate but the husband didnt. So he ate it. Once MY food was ready, my girl fixed my plate with the fish and cabbage etc, and gave it to me. My friends wife expressed that she thought it wasnt fair that   We served them the same food me and my girl ate even though my friends wife didnt eat at all. My friend didnt complain, all he said was ‘beggars cant be choosers,’ and continued to eat. I explained to my friends wife that this food was made for us and is supposed to last us for the week for left overs and this food was already made before they came over. Me myself, i didnt think it was rude to give them the chicken and rice because all the food was freshly made and tasted great. And the salmon was predetermined for me and my gf. Truthfully i think i didnt have to feed them anything but i chose to not be inconsiderate and not eat in their face. My friends wife made ‘jokes’ through out the night about my ‘nice plate of food with the fish and mac n cheese’. Afterwards we all had pie n ice cream and she ate that. For now on, i wont offer them food anymore when they come over. Those comments kinda pissed me off. She seemed kind of ungrateful. Am i the asshole for not giving them the same food me and my girlfriend ate? Sorry for the long text.	Asshole	0	0

But plans changed, and the date got pushed back, so the family wouldn't be all together anymore.

Still, my girlfriend and I thought we should go, so I signed up for the rescheduled date with just the two of us this time. 

Then she learned her flight to leave for her internship was before the Fun Day, instead of afterward, like we originally thought it was. Neither of us realized that until just two days ago. The event is today. 

So basically, I RSVP'd to go to this family work function, but I don't have a family in town to go with anymore. I don't really want to go now because of that, as well as because I'm not a fan of my job in the first place, I see these guys more than I see my own family with the hours they got me working, and I really don't want to spend my weekend going stag to a family day with all my coworkers and their families.

by9fii	2019-06-08 16:02:18		AITA for not liking how close my friends are?	"So I’m in college and I met a group of friends through my boyfriend. We all get along fine but recently two of my friends have gotten a lot closer due to sharing classes and whatnot. Friend 1 (P) lives in another dorm than Friend 2 (D) but sleeps over every weekend because she stays here to study too late with D (it’s also not that far of a walk and she’s only started doing it when they got closer). P also will only ever really invite D out to places and will always whisper to him when hanging out with us. (It’s not entirely fair for me to shit on them for that as I also whisper to my boyfriend, but they’re mostly little “I love you’s” and not asking if they can go get coffee or whatever.) Recently, P has had several events to go to but has only invited D to them and we found out about it through D. We would have gone if she had told us (and we did end up going, but P only got tickets for D). There are several more events in which she only hangs out with us when D is there or where either will leave us to hang out with each other. It hurts my feelings as I was close to both of them earlier this year and I feel like they don’t need me as a friend anymore now that they have each other. We’ve already had a discussion about this and at least one of them has agreed to try and be more considerate about it, but the other has not. We have been getting into more fights and being more passive aggressive to one another because I get annoyed about their actions, but I don’t want to say anything about it. The annoyance is bleeding into my actions, I think, and I will apologize to them for that but I want to talk to them again about how they’re acting makes me feel. I really value them as friends and I don’t want to lose the friendship just because I didn’t talk to them about this. 

I just want to know if I would be TA if I talked to them about this? Am I being petty about our friendship?"		1	0
by9f4k	2019-06-08 16:01:15	RunningSniper85	AITA For being part of a splinter group chat after a friend did something that almost nobody liked	"Before I begin, I know I'm the asshole, but I'm wondering if the other friend(let's call him Greg) is also an asshole in this situation.

So I have a group chat on Facebook messenger with me, my gf, and a bunch of other people(including gf's brother, though that doesn't really matter). This chat also included Greg. At the point that this all happened, Greg had been dating a guy for a few months(let's call the boyfriend Jim). The group decided to go and hang out, and get some dinner. With the obvious exception of Greg, this is everyone's first time meeting Jim. 

Fast forward to dinner, our group was split up between two table; one of which was me and my gf, and Greg and Jim. Up to this point, Jim was never in the group chat, it had never really been talked about. You see, my group tends to like consensus on things, including adding new members. Well, Greg decided to ask us(my gf and I) if we should add Jim into the chat. I said that we should at least talk to everyone else first. His response: ""I don't care, I'm adding him in."" To be clear, this wasn't a dismissive ""I don't care,"" he was just really excited.

Later, after Greg and Jim left, we all had a chat about this, and nobody was happy about it(except for one friend, Tom, who I'll talk about later.) Later after everyone is home, we started using a second group chat that was buried somewhere in the past, that included everyone but Greg, Jim, and gf's brother(who wasn't present for the incident, and to this day has no idea that anything even happened.) At some point in the weeks following, Tom mentioned that he did give Greg the okay to add in Jim, and was very insistent that he said it was fine(I'm not sure about everyone else here, but I don't really think that's okay, he didn't consult any of us and didn't see anything wrong with this at all, even though we all disagreed with him unanimously.) 

Long story short, we used the second chat almost exclusively. It got to the point that we mostly didn't even think about Greg and Jim, and just made all of our plans without them. This includes seeing movies, playing games, D&D, etc... 

We've switched back to the original chat at this point, and I'm already seeing why I had no issue with the second chat in the first place(basically just Greg being an asshole in general.)

I see what I did wrong, as well as everyone else involved in the second chat, but are we really the only assholes here?

Edit: I probably should explain the main issues with Greg. He's one of the most entitled and opinionated people I've ever met. If he has an opinion, he would torch a whole country to defend it, regardless of how insignificant the whole issue is. In the past, he made a joke that ended up insulting me quite a bit.

by9djq	2019-06-08 15:57:04		WIBTA for leaving my “friend” alone for 3 hours?	"Hi everyone,
first of all: sorry for any grammatical errors, English is not my native language.

I (32F) and my friend (30F) will go to a concert, which will take place in a big city in our country.
We are not close friend, the only thing in common is that we like this singer and his music.
I bought 2 normal price tickets, one for me and one for my mother (she likes the singer too). 
The friend is a bigger fan than me, so she bought the VIP ticket: for this reason we will not be together at the concert.
She asked me which train we  are going to catch and said that she will come with us because she doesn’t want to travel alone. I said ok and I told her the timetable.

Here is my issue:
I am 100% sure that after we will arrive at the destination she will come with us for lunch and stay with us until the hotel check-in time ( therefore she will be with us about 3 hours).

I am not a very social person, I like my freedom  when I travel.  Honestly I prefer to have lunch with my mother only( we are fast eaters, instead my friend is a slow eater, we don’t want to stay more than 1 hour at the restaurant), and also exploring the city freely without somebody that follows us. 

My mother  says that we can’t leave her alone for 3 hours, and I am the asshole for even thinking that.
I think that I am not obliged to stay with her: she is an adult , we are in a safe country. I will not see her during the concert and even the morning after (because she have to return early at home) so she will be alone anyhow on the second day.

"Yesterday, I was pumping gas and a guy (who I assume might have been homeless) came up to me asking for money to fill his gas tank for him, his wife, and his grandchild to get to the VA. I said I would gladly give him some money to fill his tank enough to get him to the VA. After I said yes, he asks if I can also spare enough to buy them some food, but I said I didn’t have enough for gas and food as I am a broke college student. 

He then said that the gas was good enough, so I asked where his car was so I can fill some of his tank. He said he would do it himself and that I can just give him cash. This is when I refused and said I will only give him money to fill his tank to which he replied saying that he also needed food. I felt like the conversation was going nowhere, so I asked once again that I will fill his tank with my debit card and he began to stuffer saying nothing, so I knew he was lying. 

I told my friends and they thought I was an asshole and that I should have just gave him the money. My reasoning was that my purpose for giving him money was for what he asked, gasoline to get to the VA. If he wanted cash rather than gas, then he would have asked for it, but I would have refused. I didn’t see his car, his wife or grandchild, so I had reason to believe he was lying."		1	0

My boyfriend of almost 7 years (5 living together) sometimes use a car sharing app that is connected to my credit card. We share finances so money is not the problem here.
The point is that, being connected with my card, I can see the payments on my home banking app. This morning I was checking if some money I’m waiting for were sent to my card and noticed one of the multiples car sharing payments “in processing”. This is important: I see much more details about the transaction when it’s in processing (English is not my first language so I don’t know the specific term, I’m sorry) than when it’s completed, and it usually takes up to 4/5 days. I don’t usually check the car sharing payments because I know it’s him and I just catch a glimpse of the address. This morning I noticed that the address was the same that compared the last month in my movements and decided to check where it was in the city.
Well, it appears to be really close to this girl’s house. This girl is a university friend of my boyfriend and to be honest I never liked her but I would never tell my partner who can be friend with. At the moment I’m living abroad for a total of 3 months and he told me a couple times that he was going to have a beer with her, or that at a night out with friends there would be her there too. I was a little pissed because I feel like sometimes she’s inappropriate with my boyfriend but I was fine with it because I really trust him. 
So this morning when I saw the movements toward that area of the city (million habitants city, it’s not close to other things/ places/ friends of my boyfriend because it’s really far from our home) I was fuming and attacked him by text asking why did he go to her area for like 10 times in a month. I was aggressive and I regret this now, but I don’t regret asking for explanations. Turns out that the payments correspond to his car sharing application but the routes were completely different (just home - work trips) than my home banking app showed.
I still don’t know what it’s happened with the transactions but now my boyfriend says I’m the asshole for questioning him in such an aggressive way and for thinking he was cheating on me, although he said he would have done the same thing if it happened to him but “in a much nicer way than you did”.

"My friend, ""Jane"", tends to make everything about her. She can't talk about anything but herself for the most part. This situation is no different.

Jane met a guy through her long-time boyfriend about a year ago. She barely knows him, having only seen him a couple times and briefly speaking with him once. Jane's boyfriend has known this guy for much longer, perhaps years, and was much closer.

Sadly, this guy killed himself. This is upsetting to hear for anyone, I'm sure, just because of the circumstances. However, Jane has been nonstop crying for the past three days like she lost a dear friend. She moped at her parents' house, she moped at her boyfriend's place, she couldn't hold it together at a sort of memorial we held (maybe that one is fair), and she's been sending messages about how hard things are for her right now.

It seems to me that she hasn't really been there for her boyfriend, who actually did lose a dear friend. I can't imagine he can grieve in his own way when he's trying to prop up the fragile emotions of Jane.

WIBTA if I (as tactfully as I can) try to point out that she hardly knew the guy and that she should be there for her boyfriend in his time of need?

Currently I have a rescued elderly small cockapoo that my family rescued directly from a bad owner, a neighbor of a family member, 11 years ago. She was 1-2 at the time and it was stupid luck to get such a great dog like that. She moved out with me when I turned 18 and shes my best friend. I was discussing with friends the type of dog I'd like to get after shes gone and I said I wanted a larger size cockapoo puppy from a reputable breeder. 

I'm horribly allergic to dogs, but I've had non shedding dogs my entire life. As long as I keep them clean and brushed I'll get used to them and I'm fine. I lived with a pitbull for a time and I was a miserable mess. So I HAVE to get a poodle-mix dog, its not an option. 

I've also never had a puppy. I want to raise one puppy while I'm still young. When I look at rescue young adult poodle mixes in shelters they're snapped up in a second, or even have waiting lists, and they still cost like $600 to adopt, while the pitt next cage over is $75. I think its a big stretch to call that rescuing a dog. Poodle mix puppies are even more rare and more expensive with more people lining up for them.

They should have been together 5 months by this time if it wasn't for the fact the boyfriend was completely made up. Martin would constantly need my attention and get very angry if I didn't reply but I know where he was coming from so I took time out of my day to let him load off. So I had asked to speak to Martin's ""partner"", (who we can call James) for a while now and he always refused with a range of exuses. So after a while I decide ""what's the harm in searching"" and check on martins following/followers to try and find James. But there is no sign of his existence. Obviously this is suspicious and i confront Martin , who at first defends him self with the ""he doesn't have social media"" excuse, but then proceeds to message me a few days later (within these days he still continued to vent) explaining how James never existed and he was so sorry. I am fuming. Martin made me take time out of almost every day for 4 months just so he could off-load about his non existent boyfriend and then his excuse is just ""I wanted a boyfriend"". I have explained how annoyed I am  with him and why did he get so pissy when I didn't reply (his anger was honestly shocking at times) and he has told me I am a horrible person for being Angry, am I in the wrong?"

The volunteers are sitting in the same area as the participants since we guide them to their places. They’re supposed to sit in order in place til someone takes them. One of the participants walks up to a few female volunteers next to me and forces them to sit side by side (the chairs are supposed to be 1ft apart) and makes me go too. He ignores the guy next to me that I was talking to. Then he pulls up next to me and grabs my arms and starts waving them and makes the other girls do the same. He also makes me clap and slap my lap. I just froze up because I didn’t know what to do. He goes back to his seat since he’s about to go up. Afterwards; the volunteers are released to go watch the competition; and I go with my friend to watch. The participant from earlier sees me and I pull out my phone and call my husband. He still tries to talk to me and waves his medal in my face. I acknowledge and congratulate him, and tell him that I’m in the phone with my husband. He still stands there staring at me and I get up and walk back to the volunteer area (still on the phone, he was trying to get the attention of the guy next to me). I feel like an asshole, but I’ve been put in really bad situations similar to this before and I was very uncomfortable and afraid. I’m a female and very small in stature. AITA for walking away? Should I tell someone?

She said she couldn’t stay with Lee and I thought that’s fine she could crash on the couch for the night. I went to bed pretty early because I had work the next morning but my gf and her stayed up all night talking and my girl told me today that Lee and gf had a huge fight last night and Lee hit her a couple of times. This made me furious, so I drove over to Lee’s place fuming, I let myself in and basically just stormed his room and asked him what the fuck his deal was. 

He was confused at first but i was just going off at the cunt telling  him his gf came over last night and said that he’d hurt her. I said shit like Are you a fucking idiot why would you put your hands on her. He said that I didn’t know shit about what actually happened but I didn’t care. I shoved him and our other friend who lives with Lee had to pull me off and told me to just leave it and go home. 

Honestly I was just mad because I had so much respect for him, i’ve known him since high school and the fact that he did what he did made me so angry. Both my sister and my gf were victims of abuse so I really don’t take that shit lightly. And i didn’t want one of my best friends to land himself in jail for being a dickhead. 

AITA for going off the way i did? our other friend said i shouldn’t have reacted like that because it had nothing to do with me so I’m not sure if i should apologise 

TLDR: Bestfriend’s gf stayed at ours last night because bestfriend hit her during a fight, yelled and swore at bestfriend. AITA for going off even though it has nothing to do with me"	Asshole	0	0

by95vk	2019-06-08 15:36:23	mrsduhamel9395	AITA for my sister being mad?	"Background: 

My sister asked me yesterday if I could bring my daughter with me to stay at my grandparents with my mom and her. I told my sister (she is high functioning) that I would talk to my fiance about taking me to my grandparents tonight to sleepover and see her, but my fiance can't with work (he works at a school as a custodian and graduation weekend is upon us). 

&#x200B;

 I said I would talk it over and see, but my mother took it as I was going to definitely do so and I think she got it into my sister's head, too, that I was going to be staying. Today, I told them I couldn't stay, but that we are planning on having my sister come for a sleepover at our place (which actually is his parents/grandmothers house. We just live with them). 

&#x200B;

So, my mom got mad that my sister was upset and started messaging a bunch of crap that I forwarded to my fiance and he snapped. Then, I told him my sister was asking if she could stay the night tonight and I said I would see what everyone says. Fiance, as frustrated as he is, says yes and that he will grab her after he gets out of work and I still need to see what my MIL says.

The thing is that this Sunday i was going to the barbecue but my wife also had plans. She wanted to see my nephew fencing match. Now personally I don’t find two guys fighting with sticks entertaining but I know my wife is very attached with my nephew so she goes to a lot of his match and I normally go to somewhere near so that i don’t die of boredom.

The thing is that the house my friends chose is very far from the place the match is going to take place, and it starts when I’m supposed to already be in the barbecue. And my wife doesn’t know how to drive ( she is learning but still cannot drive in a city or a highway ) so I should take her.

I told her I wouldn’t sacrifice meeting with my friends for her to see my nephew, she told me it was important because it was a championship or something like that and she wanted to be with him. We got in a big argument about but We didn’t came to an agreement. Finally she managed to convince a friend of her to take her but she is still made at me, Am I the asshole?"	Asshole	0	0

by923d	2019-06-08 15:25:57	rodeodrive123	AITA for wanting to tell my GF's lover's wife about cheating?	" 

So I (30m) met my girlfirend (26f) whilst travelling. We lived in Australia for a year/18 months then came home. Coming hom from such an adventure was always hard. We ended up buying a doer-upper. Whilst this happen we were living at my dads.

We got the house in november and since then its been my full focus, whereas she was working full time in the nearest big city. The house became my job and I was frustrated that she was too busy (voluntarily) with work to help me.

Also in this time my dad went through a break-up with a person who he had been with for 17 years, and from early Jan to March was basically pissed the whole time.

So a couple of months ago I was sat at home with her dad, (she had gone home for the weekend) and I heard her iPad making noises. I check it out and its suggestive messages to a co-worker (""can't stop thinking about the other day"", ""I still want more"",""what you said to me turned me on."" Apparently nothing physical went on, it was just text messages and talking dirty to each other at a desk when they were working on a project (what the messages referred to). Went on for a couple of months, from what I'm told.

It turns out the guy was a director (40m) at her company, and he's a married man with a wife (unknown f). I keep thinking about telling the wife, because

a) she deserves to know.

b) I'm the only one that can tell her

c) This may be the clincher - I want my ex to suffer a little. Her job means more than anything to her, and after what she did to me and our relationship, I feel as though I'm obliged to.

d) It'll give me some closure. I spend hours a day wondering why I shouldn't disclose this. But if I get it out in the open then I won't have to think that/

We argued about it, she moved out and over the next five weeks we kept meeting. But last week she called it a day. There are many issues as there always is. But the main one (I think) is that she's worried that I'd never be able to forgive her and she'd spend her life treading on eggshells.

I didn't want to put an end to the relationship and it pains me.

AITA for wanting to tell the man's wife? For me it would be closure, as at the moment I spend my life wondering why we can't work and sort thingsout. Whereas if I tell the man's wife I'll have a reason for it not working (she'd never forgive for that) and I'll be able to move on?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

by916v	2019-06-08 15:23:18	therainmow	AITA for telling my dad to “disappear in my life” after he cheated on my mom and left us with huge debt	"Hi guys! Almost a year ago, my dad suddenly went MIA on us. My mom said he gathered all of his stuff in the middle of the night and left while she’s away on a trip for work. This was after he was caught by mom cheating with a college girl who he paid the tuition for, gave allowances, and even provided financial aid for the mistress’s family. Mom confronted him but he countered “he was just trying to help the poor girl.” He was multiple times & my mom confronted him but he denied the allegations yet again.  Dad had been blatantly calling his mistress within earshot yet he acts like he’s done nothing wrong. Did I say they now have a kid? Yeah. But that’s not the end of it.

Earlier this year, a lot of people from different banks had been coming to our house looking for him cos he fled and didn’t fcking pay his multiple debts. And now, the banks kept on pestering my mom to pay for them cos he freaking forged her signature as a co-borrower without her consent! Mother had been crying cos she doesn’t have the money to pay for everything!

Bet you think that’s all huh. Hell naw! A few weeks later another bank came to ask for a full payment or else our house will be forfeited. Turns out, my dad had made it as a collateral for a loan he couldn’t pay. After my mom told me the story, i almost broke down. Me and my siblings are living in different cities now but we try hard to chip in to at least pay for the interest. I was so angry I wished him death but I can’t cos he’s still my father. We’re trying our best to forget him and normally go on with our lives, take on these problems step by step though it has been real difficult lately.

Then last week, he called to “check up” on me. I’m still furious after everything he’s done so i told him to fuck off and don’t contact me again cos I don’t want him in my life anymore. I think that was the harshest I’ve been to my dad. I just exploded with anger and couldn’t really care less about what he would feel. Then I hung up on him and blocked his number. Since then I have been thinking about it and this gnawing guilt has never left me that I couldn’t sleep at night sometimes. I’m just in shambles cos at the end of the day, he’s still my father. He’s the man who fed me, sent me to school, and provided everything I needed growing up until he just went nuts with his cheating and debts. I just feel so guilty and too conflicted about the way I acted. Now, some of my relatives think I’m TA.

TLDR; Dad left after cheating on my mom, sold our house without us knowing, and now we are drowned in the pits of debt because of him and I said fuck you to him and to never appear in my life again.

by8zyx	2019-06-08 15:19:52	riles_riles_	AITA for saying I don't care that my sister's gay?	"When my sister came out to me a couple years ago, I told her I don't care about her being gay. In hindsight*, she was looking for an answer like ""you're so brave"" or ""I support you,"" so my apathy took her by surprise, and she hasn't fully regained her trust in me since then. 

It's not that I don't care about her; I genuinely mean that I don't care if she's gay. I support my sister for being my sister, and it shouldn't matter if she's gay or not. If she's bullied for being gay I'll 100% stand up for her, but it hasn't (and shouldn't) change how I feel about her. I care about her just as much after as before.

 I've always hated how people use things like sexuality, religion, race, etc. for attention. I mean, it's one thing when you're speaking out against discrimination against yourself or your people, but when people use it for personal gain it irritates me. I support you for being you, and no matter if you're white, black, Christian, Muslim, atheist, gay, straight, trans, etc. that's not going to change how I see you as a person, and I will never discriminate against someone solely because of these things.

Edit: to be clear, I know she wasn't asking for attention, I was just saying I don't like when other people use their sexuality/race/religion for attention or personal gain

""=quote
'=paraphrase

I have religious friends and others practice witchcraft. She has unique views on spirituality and many conspiracy theories. Hardly an hour passes without a tidbit like ""Cats are higher beings."" It was interesting to hear a bizzare perspective. I responded when I had something to share and stayed silent on the subject of mystical kitties.

It came to a head when she hijacked a conversation with her kids.

Side note:
>I babysat for free a few times. Maybe she worried I would indoctrinate her kids in scientific thinking. *(According to her, I ""worship Science"".  If so, I am seriously behind on tithes.)* But with her kids, I just talked about video games and math homework because she wasn't around to bring up crazy shit.

I was telling her kids that I didn't train my cat not to eat my birds because it would be hard to train against instinct when she broke in with 'Animals are superior to humans and they all coexist peacefully'. Also, ""Humans aren't animals and anyone who says so is wrong.""

- Thanks for hijacking the conversation we were having. (Which I didn't say)

- I watched jenday conures try to kill a sun conure in their cage despite ample food and space. (Which I DID say)

- The sweeping statement about ""humans aren't animals and anyone who says so is wrong.""  *It's a spiritual thing; be diplomatic.*  I said, ""**In the context of taxonomy**, humans are classified in the animal kingdom as mammals because of (shared traits).""

What followed was an increasingly heated exchange where she claimed I was pushing my beliefs on her. I insisted I don't care what she believes, her blanket statement is wrong in this context. Scientifically, people are animals. (And evidence suggests goats and bears don't coexist.)

Eventually, she announced that she'd finish what she had to say and the conversation would be over and I need to keep my opinions to myself. I said, 'Absolutely not. I won't let you say your piece without the same courtesy.'

She said, 'Fine, say what you need to say.' I chose a neutral example that 
: a shirt is blue in English but azul in Spanish. One doesn't make the other wrong; it's just a fact of perspectives. 'The shirt is azul to Spanish-speakers' is factually accurate and isn't shoving Spanish down someone's throat.

After, she said mockingly, 'Okay you shared. Do you feel better? Does it make you feel good to force someone to listen to you?'

Side note:
>I was uncomfortably aware of the kids.  For them, I'd ignored past implications. But this was stated outright and I have a limit.

There was more but I walked away soon after. The details barely matter; it was more of the same shit.

I can't imagine telling someone ""keep your opinions to yourself"" if you have any respect for them. It sucks to lose a friend but maybe this friendship wasn't worth it."	Not the A-hole	0	0

-He’s 33 and I’m 25(f).

I used my boyfriends microwave, but I accidentally microwaved the pudding for too long and the plastic cup it was in melted. This caused a lot of smoke to come out of the machine and a horrible smell in the air. As soon as he smelt the smoke he came out of the bathroom understandably upset and he started shouting what are you doing etc. I kept saying I was sorry, don’t worry I’ll buy him a new one today I’ll tidy it etc but he kept shouting at me about the smell. 

He was running a bath before this happened so he shouted at me that “ I might as well get in it now because he’s going to be cleaning all day” . His flat is a very small so the bathroom is right next to the kitchen. As I started getting undressed he kept wrenching open the bathroom door more than once and shouting about his curtains, the smell, about how we definitely can’t go out today (that bits important) because he’s going to have to wash all the curtains in the flat and the bedsheets and the washing in the kitchen to get rid of the smell.

So I’m basically standing there, naked, and he keeps running into the small bathroom thrusting curtains in my face, shouting at me to smell them, because look at what I’ve done, smell it! And I felt like I was trapped so I shouted at him to just LEAVE ME ALONE.

So he slammed shut the door and I can hear him shouting to himself, swearing and effing over everything and I’m still feeling guilting over the microwave so I used my phone to a new one with same day delivery.

So he pulls open the door one last time and says well he better get to Argos to go get a new one then and I said I’d already ordered one and it’s arriving today. 

And he kicked off. Saying that I was being childish and “throwing a strop” because I deliberately ordered one to arrive today because even though he’d said he couldn’t go anywhere today to wash the stuff, now we actually can’t go anywhere today because we have to stay in. Called me pathetic and other names and I just started crying. He’s shouting about how I’m the bad guy because I’ve made him feel guilty because my reaction is making him look like a bully and I wanted to say that he was being a bully. I’m naked and basically trapped and he’s shouting at me so loud I feel like a deer in the headlights.

Later on he apologised for shouting but said that i need to realise my reaction is what made him worse and it wasn’t fair that I made us both stay in to wait for the microwave when we did have plans to go out that day.

by8rkw	2019-06-08 14:56:12		AITA for selling my motorcycle?	"So, I wanted to learn how to ride a motorcycle. I told my uncle & he sold me one of his motorcycle for way less than what it was worth. He told me he would've just given it to me, but my aunt said I should pay at least something so I'll value it more.

Moving along, I took the motorcycle course & I passed the tests, but they wouldn't give me my certificate because they wanted me to retake it to get more practice (pissed about that, but off-topic).Anyhow, during the course I rode a smaller bike & I really liked it. It's just the right size for me & I'm comfortable with something with that much power. I live on a military base & I literally only want to use it to commute back & forth to work & the occasional going off base into town.

My uncle said he wanted to keep the bike in the family & quite frankly, I don't want that bike (it's a cruiser) anymore. It's not because I don't like it, but because it's too big (it's 649cc) for me & I don't feel as comfortable on it. I'm liking the smaller bikes in the 400cc to 250cc range. I'm not a big person & the smaller bikes are more proportional with my body size as well.

I've been looking at prices & the ones I want brand new are in my price range. If I sold the motorcycle I bought from my uncle or traded it in, I could get a smaller bike with money to spare.

I just feel bad because if I sold it, I'd profit tremendously from it. He was really excited to give me the motorcycle, he literally spent thousands on maintenance to make sure it was in perfect condition for me & he gave me gear & everything. I just don't want to be the AHOLE & sell it / trade it in so that I can get a different bike & to get rid of something he wanted to keep in the family. If I did do it, the extra money I got from a sale, I was thinking of giving it to him since I feel it's not my money to take.

I'm asking here before I bring this up to him as well as advice."	Asshole	1	0

by8m1j	2019-06-08 14:39:25	WaterfallGamer	AITA to tell my wife not to come out to my son's soccer games	"My son is 2 and today he had his second day at soccer. He is enjoying it especially the freezies and endless field to run on.

Last week on his first day, my real expectation just him have fun even if he's chasing butterflies. Just running outside and being outside is good. He played well, kind of shy going on the field a lot but he's a shy kid. He enjoys it and looks forward to the next week.

Today, he did really good. He played mosty off field and going on the field to really run on and kick the ball whenever I told him his team needs his help. Rest of time he's running and kicking his own ball which is awesome to see him dribble the ball (whats the soccer term?) My wife was miserable at the game because he wasnt primarily playing on the field like most of the kids and he was playing off field. For me it was fine he going in every now and then (as I said earlier whenever I told him he team needs help) and I will get him to spend more time on the field as the weeks go by (the team loves you helping and he will probably stay).

After the game, I ask him if he has fun he says yes and wants to go back again next weekend. Awesome, he enjoys going out on field. My wife complains again how he never spends time on the field like the other kids implying something wrong him. I told her its normal, my father and brother were both there saying its ok he had he played soccer with himself for now and he enjoys it. She still complains that it isnt normal for him to be 2 and ""far behind"" the other kids. A lot of these kids are from soccer families and this is their 2nd season ( January start ). She doesnt see it that way and disagrees with me.

Not wanted the negativity around his experience at soccer, I tell her next weekend and going forward I dont want her going to his games. I want him to have fun, learn soccer and eat freezies.

Am I the asshole for telling my wife to not come to soccer games?

Im sincerely also looking for devils advocate view points too because she cant probably express her thoughts.

EDIT: Important point noted from a commenter. My wife is from China been in North America for 10 years now. Had parents her treated her the same but hated. She is unable to express why shes doing it to our son for soccer. My apologies, please edit responses, I will go over them again."	Not the A-hole	0	0
by8l2j	2019-06-08 14:36:33	iesharael	WIBTA if I yelled at my family after my sister gives birth?	"Bad at titles I know.

Pretty much I’m the youngest of 5 children and I was woken up this morning to be told my sister has just gone into labor with my 6th nephew (8th counting nieces). That statement filled me with dread cause ever since I was younger I’ve never liked children and for some reason my family and especially this sister’s in-laws love to tease me for it. I swear it’s like they get some sort of high asking me when I’m going to have kids and forcing me to hold the babies. They are always so smug about it as if touching Gods precious miracle will suddenly cure me. The problem with that is I’m 20 years old, still in school, and not even dating anyone. Plus on top of that I recently had a terrifying pregnancy scare no one except my dad and the thankfully not father will ever know about and I’m still emotionally struggling with

WIBTA if when they start up again telling me how I should have kids and I’d love them once I’m a mother I either walk out or start asking them if they are gonna pay for the sperm donor or something? I really just want straight up yell at them that I’m 20 years old and stressed enough as it is and don’t need a baby on top of that. I don’t want to ruin my sister’s day or take the attention away from her but I’m at my breaking point with this stuff. 

Depending on when she has the kid my dad might not even be around as a person for me to hide behind. Considering last time I got a roughly 45 min lecture from my mom because I ended up panicking when people refused to take the baby from me and started actually yelling because I was terrified I would drop it and my ARM WAS BREAKING OUT WHERE ITS HEAD WAS but nooooo babies are perfect and I should be begging to hold one ever second I can.

EDIT; My sister had the kid. My dad my dad is taking me driving which I think he’s doing cause he knows how stressed I’m feeling rn. I’m going to talk to him about it and ask him if he can tell them to cool it when they start since they never listen to me

EDIT2:baby visit over! Dad handed me one of my shirts to change into before we left that was completely covered in cat hair. My sister flipped if anyone tried to come near me with the baby. My sister’s mother in law did try to start the “when are you gonna have a baby?” Routine literally when she first saw me and I made the sperm donor comment and she got disgusted and left (much to the amusement of her son) which they were still talking about 15 mins later when me and dad quietly left. All in all went much better than expected! Still freaked out a little but seeing all those tubes in my sisters arm but that’s ok cause it’s over now"	Asshole	0	0

"I work for a medium size company and typically everyone has to stop and meet up in the conference room to do a birthday thing for someone's birthday. Every employee's birthday. For most of the company it's a nice break they look forward to and some people really enjoy planning it.   


So when I requested not to have any cake thing, it was not well received by some people or it was seen as me being selfish, and unfriendly. I can see their side now that the point that it's more about them wanting to be nice and rejecting that was shitty and don't know if I should have just said nothing. I know it's not a massive mistake in the long run,  I want to avoid a being the asshole, if I was one.  


My side: I find it awkward standing there while sing happy birthday and make small talk while eating cake or watching others eat cake. The conference room gets rather crowded. It's just very uncomfortable. I asked for no cake thing, no singing (I am not a child, you are not my family, it's weird). I just let people know that if anyone wanted to have lunch together instead, that'd be cool."	No A-holes here	1	0

My best friend had a very bad, toxic relationship in the past. This was on-and-off for a while and went on for nearly two years. 

A year ago they finally broke up ‘for real’ and it took her some months to get over it. Right now she’s not even completely over him, I guess. Problem is that this guy has quite a strong personality, and my best friend is the sweetest human being on this planet - but struggles standing her ground. (She admits this also and is working on it.) 

We’re roommates now, and some time ago this guy suddenly showed up by her door. (Not stalkery, it’s the same address she had before. I moved in with her.) Best friend wasn’t there and I was ready to turn him away, but he started pleading that he has really changed and wants to get in touch with her again and even wrote her a letter. (As she has him blocked everywhere.) 

He asked me to give it to her and I said sure, but didn’t do it. I’m sure she will fall for him again, even though he said all these things before. I love her to bits and don’t want to let this guy hurt her anymore. 

AITA for not giving her the letter and let her decide for herself?

Edit: The relationship was toxic in the sense that he was extremely jealous and manipulative about it too. (‘I only need you, why do you need friends te make you happy? Etc.) He never physically abused her, as far as I know."	Not the A-hole	0	0

An hour of crying later my girlfriend comes over to comfort me but my ride was leaving soon so I had to go, plus I had work early next morning.

She said to text her when I get to my house and we can talk through it.

I get to my house 20 minutes later and call her to no response. Then I fall asleep around 11:40. I woke up the next morning to see some texts from her around 2am saying she's drunk and but I'm a perfect boyfriend.

I work in a retail store as a summer job because I’m still in school. I just got hired at this new place around two weeks ago. I have this coworker, let’s call him Eric. He’s 26, whereas I’m only 18. So I barely know Eric obviously, as I’ve only had a few shifts with him. However, he started joking with me and trying to get to know me pretty early on. He has an extremely sarcastic personality. Despite barely knowing him, he called me ‘slow’ one time, told me when he first met me he thought I was a bitch, and told me I was a hoe. All these things were done sarcastically, so I wasn’t offended. However, this made me assume he can take a joke.

The most recent shift he started ranting to me about his life. I felt kinda uncomfortable because he was over sharing a lot. He kept being like “I’m so average, I’m so ugly, like I’m bad at everything I do.” So I didn’t really know what to say because I barely know him, and he was begging for compliments. I was just like “no you’re not, stop saying that.” But in response to that, he was like “no you hesitated.” Then he started ranting to me about how nobody takes him seriously, and he feels like a little bitch even though he’s an adult. I laughed when he called himself a little bitch because I was so uncomfortable. Then he started being like “I was being serious, why did you laugh at me?” Then he proceeded to ignore me and roll his eyes at me for the rest of the shift.

She's from a village, but every day comes to the city to work. Our dates were always after work and once our ""time"" for the day was over, everyone would go home on their own vehicle.

One day, right after the date, she called me saying she had a small accident. She damaged the wheel on a curb. I've changed the wheel and sent her home. 

Next day she says that her father would not give her the car anymore, as she's a ""bad driver"".

I've asked her what about the work, how would she come to the city if she has no car, to which I got the following:

Her: ""My father will bring me and take me home right after work.""
Me: ""What about our dates? Will me have time?""
Her: ""Well... he said he'd come right after, so I think we'll have no time at all.""
Me: ""And... Isn't there and alternative?""

The alternative was that I would drive her home. 

Months passed since then, I'm taking her home almost every day and I've noticed something that well... was supposed to happen. My monthly expenses went skyrocketing because of gas I had to have to drive her home. 

On one of our usual dates I've mentioned that I can't save almost anything because of her lack of car. I said that she has to speak to her father and ask him to stop this making this childish decisions and either give her the car or pay me the gas I waste taking her home.

She agreed with me, but at the same time looked mad."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Recently my friend's friend (Roy)'s parents met with his friends Adam and David's parents. After the long dinner party the three, and a fourth Louis decided to go to Roy's house for a sleepover. Except they told their parents that they would go on foot. Now, while the city is big, Roy's house and he place where they had dinner at was only like an hour's walk apart, so the parents let them do it.

The group of friends collectively decided to take a detour and stop at a store that was open 24/7 to get a can of redbull. Roy lied to his mother constantly about his whereabouts just so he and his friends could get redbull. (The parents of the group absolutely hated their kids drinking redbull). All the friends supported the idea of lying to the parent about their whereabouts.

The only problem occurred that Roy's mother called him and told him that she would meet them in the middle and take them from there. For a while he was able to lie, gradually he became more and more paranoid about his mother finding out, until his cab was reaching the place where they were but ultimately the mother caught wind of something wrong when Adam spoke to her.

She later told Roy that she thought that they were smoking. (If they were so mad about redbull, the parents would have killed the kids if they thought they were smoking). Ultimately Roy gave up where he was, and his mother told him to stay exactly where he was and that she would come pick him and his friends up. Upon hearing this, Adam said that it was all Roy's fault, and then took off with David and Louis. Louis cancelled the cab. Roy waited there alone for his mother to come pick him up.

Now, I know that he was wrong to lie to his mother, but was Roy the asshole towards his friends?"	Asshole	1	0

by8cd4	2019-06-08 14:10:13	netlive2000	WIBTA if I set an ultimatum for my overweight dancepartner (ballroom)?	"Before anyone goes to call me out on fat shaming. No. This is not what this post is about in the slightest. I'm all about healthy body positivity and encouragement to love yourself.      


Now that this is out of the way, let me try to explain my situation. I've been doing ballroom and latin tournament dancing for about two years now, my partner is a female around my age (19) who is overweight. Now don't get me wrong, she isn't obese, she is actually pretty fit for her body type, but there is still a significant difference in weight between her and the other girls in our club. She was the one who actually encouraged me to start training, was always patient with me when we agreed to be partners and helped me build up confidence to dance like I do today. I owe her alot, and she is a very close friend even privately.     

We've never really had to argue but recently there has been some tension rising between us. As of now, I do not have the time to train like I would half a year ago. Graduating from highschool and a part time job don't allow for 5 training sessions along with a class or private lesson per week. She was already very upset when I told her I would have to limit it to 2 per week max.      


She expects us to go back to the absolutely exhausting schedule once i have more time and I honestly lost most of my motivation for such high intensity training. I still want to participate and go there once or twice a week, but even that is getting harder and harder the better we get. And of course not all, but most, problems we encounter stem from her weight. We need time to get movements or techniques down, that take the others a fraction of what we waste, and I feel like part of that really comes from how much she weighs. She always talks high and mighty about how she wants to get a breast size reduction because of her back, but can't do it due to the state not paying it unless she weighs significantly less than she does now. She says she's on a diet but I always catch her snacking on something unhealthy, sweet or fatty when we hang out.     

Now, WIBTA if I told her I do not want to continue our training unless she _drastically_ changes her eating habits? Because I do not feel like investing this much time just because she cannot restrain herself, while I actually set up a diet and exercise plan for myself, even though I am fit as is. I'm strict with myself and try my best to make this partnership work, but feel like she only ever has motivation to be all competetive about dancing, but never about her body.      
     


Again. She is my close friend. I do not wish to upset or hurt her feelings at all. She is very dear to me, but this is not fun for me anymore.
      

Edit: I live an hour away from the city without a car and have to rely on public transportation, which is scarce here. I workout 5 times a week myself to stay fit, this was her suggestion in the first place."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Fast forward to this week. His week reaches out to my sister on Facebook and asks if I still has said friends Djembe. My sister asks me and told her I did (big mistake) and told her yes with a picture of it. Even told my sister to give her my number if she really wanted it.

Now at this point I think this is a huge “Indian fiver situation, but I’m trying to be a nice guy cause he’s it was his, but it has literally been a decade. 

I get over and then my old friends wife texts seeing if I can drop off the Djembe, and this is where I get a bit annoyed. 

In this text, there were no pleasantries, neither was the use of my name. Also, in the text there was not question of asking me to drop the Djembe off, she simple wrote that “you can drop it off at my work...” (with details of where and when)

Now these people live 1.5 hrs away from me. I was not gonna go out of my way and drive all the way over there because they all of a sudden want their drum back. 

After blowing her off a couple times saying i can’t drop it off I send her this text message after her 3rd attempt of her trying to have me drop it off:

“To be honest probably not. I've been real busy lately. Most weeknights don't work for me because of work. I never really know the time I will leave which packs out my weekends. 

Also I'm never really up in that area so it will be a stretch to get up there. Idk if when I'll be up in that area BUT if I ever am I can drop it off. Unless on the off chance you are down by this area, just let me know and I'll see if I can meet up with you. I understand you want your djembe back but I know when you guys started to move away I did ask if he wanted the Djembe back but he told me not worry about it, and trying to think back when it was probably about 10years ago. So if you're ever in the area, let me know. Otherwise whenever I am up in your area I will drop it off.”

I think this ticked her off and she finally mad e the decision to come pick it up, which she did. But when she did, she grabbed the Djembe and said thanks without any of their interaction.

Most of my friends were saying I should have dropped it off but I don’t feel back because she wasn’t being considerate of my time. To me she was the rude one. Am I wrong?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

I'm about to move countries to be with my SO and currently i'm looking for a place to stay. I'm fairly young ; My budget is pretty small so because of this i'll need a bit of help to get on my feet.
My SO's family are decently off, so i'm not asking someone who is struggling to help. 
An example (that really upsets me) would be :
i found a place i could stay in but the shower situation is bad. I asked SO if it would be possible to take showers at his place until the shower situation would be fixed and he told me he doesn't think his mom would be okay with this since it would be an extra cost. SO didn't ask her anything about helping me but even if he did ask her, he never goes against mom's word even if he really don't like it. I feel like if something bad would arise (like being thrown out) , i wouldn't get help from his family at all.
That's just an example and i get it.  Their house , their rules.It's also pretty trivial and childish to get mad over that. But it was just the fact that i couldn't grt help for something THAT small that made me sad.
I have helped SO with everything so far and have been 110% there for all his problems. Recently he had some big problems and i was pretty much the only one who didn't berate him and I supported him since the start ; i also payed for something out of my own saved up money so he wouldn't have to( a pretty significant sum for me) . My family have also said that if the roles would be switched up, they'd take SO to stay with us for as long as he'd need with no need to pay . We aren't well off and we're actually in a pretty shitty country so it's not like i'm rich and that's why they'd take him in.
I feel dissapointed and sad that i wouldn't be getting help considering what i have done for my boyfriend in the past and how my family treated him. In no way shape or form do i expect payback for my actions , i do them because i want to help him but i wish i could get some support back too. Also , AITA if i got mad at him for not having my side? He tells me that since it's a different country , people have different values and tolerate different things and he doesn't see anything wrong in it. He also said his mom doesn't really like a crowded house/strangers in the house so that's why she's like that. We decided that instead of fighting over it , we should get a second opinion

Please don't insult any of us. We're happy and our relationship is very good. He would never do anything to hurt me. It's just his family i'm having an issue with."		1	0

He then proceeded to tell me to fix my attitude, and that I'm a sad and pathetic human.

"I live in an apartment with one other roommate, we split all the bills evenly except for rent. The electric is in her name and the wifi and gas are in my name because I already had accounts set up when we moved in together. She usually ends up owning me $30-$40 a month.

&#x200B;

We've never had any issues or fights, we're very much on the same page and it's a chill environment to live in. But now she's two months behind on paying me back for those bills and I'm in the hole $80. When I asked her at the end of April, she told me she had to wait until she was paid to send me the money. Which was fine, she gets paid biweekly so I knew when the money should be coming in. Payday comes for her, when she doesn't send it I send a reminding text a day later. She apologies but said she just had to pay all her other bills with that paycheck, but in two weeks when she gets paid she'll send the money. I was doing okay with money this month so I was okay waiting and then having some extra cash at the end of the month.

And I had literally $12 in my account and no food in the house, because I was counting on that paycheck to be in my account already like it should be.

&#x200B;

I was annoyed, because I was flat broke, but should of had $80 coming from my roommate so I'd be okay waiting for my paycheck for a couple days. My roommate than answers my text, saying she doesn't have the money now because she had to book an Airbnb in another state for her birthday in a couple weeks. I was fuming and didn't answer. And that night she stocked the kitchen with groceries for her and got takeout for dinner.

&#x200B;

So she left for her birthday trip yesterday. No money was sent my way, when she comes back she'll have a week until she owes me close to $120, and I doubt she'll come back from a trip with extra cash like that, and I'll get the same nonsense about having to wait two weeks. So I changed the wifi password, which kicked everyone off the wifi. She can have the password again when I'm paid back in full.

&#x200B;

I was telling this to some of my friends, and they all said I was being petty and creating problems because she'll pay me back eventually. This happened once before and I was paid back after two months. And I do feel really petty, but it'd been two months now, coming up on three, where I've been paying for the wifi all by myself. If she was having money problems and told me we could've talked this out and I wouldn't have minded as much. But all I've heard from her is that she doesn't have the money because she's planning a big birthday trip and going out a lot."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Firstly it’s an all day thing. 10am to 9pm. I had a terrible night sleep, waking up tired and with a headache. I postponed myself to 2pm.

Secondly it is **pouring** with rain. This teamed with my first problem isn’t thrilling me, and I think I’d be bad company. 

***

I feel guilty because this is a house-warming bbq, and I’ve been keen from the start (about 6 weeks ago). If there was a reminder text update in the group chat, I’d still say keen. 

I’ve even mentioned my dietary requirements, and am a little worried the organiser bought some foods for me. 

Haven’t seen a lot of these people for a while and I think I’ve gutted them from seeing me for the first time since some travels. 

***

It’s approaching 14;00 and I’ve officially bailed to no reply. I feel bad, but I’ve also got a wringing headache and cannot be bothered to poach, so I am on here.

by80la	2019-06-08 13:33:43		AITA for avidly avoiding my coworker?	"For context, this is a coworker who works the night shift while I do not. The first time we ever spoke was when he came in an hour before I got off and he had to paint my desk, and he spent the majority of that hour flirting with me even though it was rather obvious (or so I thought) that it was making me uncomfortable, and I was awkwardly laughing it off. The SECOND time he speaks to me, he asks me out to a date. Now, I'm a rather socially awkward person when it comes to this kind of thing as I have not dated anyone since I was in 9th grade (I'm 19 now) and I'm not really interested in dating just anyone, especially someone that gives me creepy vibes. The very first thing he asked was if I liked movies, to which I replied that they don't really interest me, and then he asked if I was into Pokemon, which again isn't one of my interests, and he proceeds to ask me out to watch the new Pikachu movie in theaters. Although his date idea isn't the issue, I figured it was worth noting, because you would think someone wouldn't still suggest an idea that clearly didn't appeal to the other person's interests whatsoever. I thought I had laid out enough hints that I wasn't really interested, even lying about my age a little by saying, ""you don't think I'm a little young for you? I just turned 18"" which really isn't that far off, I just turned 19 in March, and if you looked at me, you would honestly probably guess I was 16 (which I would've said I was if my work hired people that young) He responded by saying he was okay with it, which... really wasn't what I was trying to get at. He's 23-24 years old himself. At one point, I just became speechless, I was hardly making eye contact with him, I was visibly uncomfortable with the situation. Then, he ends the conversation with ""I'll give you time to think and ask you again in a week."" It's been probably nearly a month since that happened since I luckily started working day shifts for a while, but as I'm back to working shifts that can possibly overlap with his, I've been avidly avoiding him, as I can't express how much just the mere thought of that conversation makes me cringe and feel uncomfortable all over again. Since that conversation, I've found out that he apparently glares at one of my male coworkers when he's around me, and he has also tried flirting with at least one other girl in my workplace. I feel like I might be being a bitch by not just sucking it up and giving him an outright ""no,"" but that's easier said than done. AITA here?"		1	0

I only get to see them (older sister, mum and step dad) a couple of times a year, and every time I do, it’s the same routine where they (in my opinion) drink far too much, they get really loud and obnoxious, and it irritates the hell out of me. I can’t drink because I have an intolerance to alcohol. I’m not against drinking, but I don’t understand why they can’t just have a few drinks in a more relaxed way, rather than binge drinking to the point that they’re impossible to have a conversation with. I try my best to keep a smile on my face and not show how much they’re annoying me. I’m an introvert and the amount of noise three people can make makes me feel really overwhelmed. On my last visit I just lied about what time my flight home was so I could get some peace and quiet at the airport. I plan on having kids in a few years and when I do, I don’t want them around my family when they’re drunk. Do I need to just lighten up, stop being so judgmental and get over it?	Not the A-hole	0	0
by7wel	2019-06-08 13:19:50		AITA for snapping at my boyfriend due to his obsessive comments about his brother’s sex life ?	"My boyfriend and his little brother, who is 19 and who’s girlfriend is 18, are very close it seems. They are each other’s best friends, which I find rather charming and lovely. 

However, when I say he can’t go a day without mentioning his brother’s sex life once, if not three or four times, I’m not exaggerating. From what positions they like (I felt a bit upset that he pointed up his brother’s girlfriend “loves being on top” since I’m very self conscious about not being able to make him finish while on top), to how often. 

I’m not a prude - quite the opposite. I often discuss and joke about sex and porn on the whole, and have no issues admitting to often masturbating daily or more. However, when it comes to personal sex lives, I guess I’m slightly old fashioned. Usually, hearing about people’s sex lives doesn’t make me uncomfortable like hearing about my boyfriend’s brother’s does, but I don’t necessarily want to know every detail either. 

It came to a head today when I made a comment, after my boyfriend started mentioning his brother’s sex life again, that I was ‘so lucky’ to hear all this. He didn’t pick up on the sarcasm and added that he’d try to film them next time, jokingly. I finally lost it and told him to fuck off, adding that he was really pervy (I really regret saying that). I apologised about 15 minutes afterwards. 

Was/Am I being a total asshole and closed minded? Am I super sensitive and just a prude who doesn’t know it? My older sister was an adult when I was growing up and we weren’t that close, so maybe talking in such details is normal for siblings. 

However, I also don’t get the benefit of telling me about it all the time. What’s the desired outcome?! Because it just makes me feel closer minded, uncomfortable and not good enough. But I’m scared to sound like a total conservative (no hate to you right wingers out there) and old.

My mother is Hispanic and I’m bi. So, I heard many slurs growing up and much more. She’s abusive, a drunk, and to put it the best way possible a hick. She pretends she’s the sweet old country granny but in reality she’s complete trash. If I could list everything out I truly would just so y’all could hear how horrible she is. With that said, recently another fight broke out and she tried making me out to be some bad guy all because I said on FB I’m bi. I tried talking to my mom but she told me to ignore it, forget the past, and love her. How can I love her when she’s a horrible person but I’m conflicted. Idk if I’m overreacting and I should just listen to my mom or I should listen to myself. I try my best to avoid her and FB is my only form of contact to her..

One of the ladies is extremely flirtatious with me all the time. I was quite drunk and she came up to me and started chatting. She told me she found me very attractive and I told her I think she's pretty. She immediately blushed and told me we will talk about this later when her husband wasn't around. A few hours later, she orders an uber and takes me out the front and starts kissing me. I was really taken back by this. Especially since she's married and at least 20 years older than me and has kids. We then go to this club and I sit down and she continues to make out with me, sit on me etc etc. My friend has told me her and her partner are swingers but I don't completely believe that.

by7uvk	2019-06-08 13:14:40		AITA for yelling at my friend's girlfriend?	"This happened a few years ago. In my senior year of high school, I had a friend group of 4 people: me and three others. One of those three friends finally got the girl he had been chasing for almost a year. We were very happy for him and congratulated him, even though we would sometimes mock him because of all the things he would do for her (like buying expensive chocolate). This however never bothered him, as he would mock us with the fact that we didn't have a girlfriend. However, the longer he would spend time with her, the more arrogant he would become, placing his girlfriend always above us. On top of that, his girlfriend wasn't the nicest. She was a straight A-student, always trying to flatter all of the teachers so she could get better results and would often mock basically everyone that had lower grades than her. When we confronted our friend with this, he always told us we were just jealous.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few months and a lot has happened (I will not go into detail, because it's quite a lot). The result at this moment is that one of my two other friends doesn't talk to our girlfriend-friend anymore and I had a few serious verbal fights with the girlfriend-friend. We had PE and were playing baseball. It was the girlfriend's turn to swing the bat and I was the catcher, standing behind her. However, she didn't want to swing to bat, as she declared that she would make herself 'look ridiculous'. She tried to convince our teacher to not swing the bat. I have to mention that she tried to pull stuff like this all the time. One time, we had to do parkour and she requested the entire class to leave, so we wouldn't see her fail the course. The teacher accepted her offer and we had to leave the gym so she could perform her course alone. Back to the baseball-thing now. By this time, two or three minutes already have passed and she is still arguing with the teacher, making the rest of our class starting to lose their patience. Out of pure frustration, I threw my glove and catcher-helmet on the ground and yelled: ""If you don't swing that f\*\*king baseball bat right now, only then you will make yourself look even more ridiculous!"" She looked at me, threw the bat away, yelled: ""Well there you have it, I swung the bat!"" and left the field crying. All the guys of our class started applauding (the boyfriend was sick that day) and even some of her (female) friends came to me and said: ""Thank you for standing up to her.""

&#x200B;

The next day, I had to apologize to her as a punishment from my teacher (even though I didn't want to). Her boyfriend, our friend, came to me and told me he never wanted to see or talk to me ever again. I was fine with that and told him to have fun with his parasite of a girlfriend for the rest of his life. So yeah... AITA for yelling at his girlfriend?"		1	0
by7tzi	2019-06-08 13:11:41		AITA for telling a girl her boyfriend tried to cheat on her with me last year?	"So exactly a year ago I started speaking to a guy online who I knew through mutual friends. One thing led to another and we started flirting, and before long we were exchanging photos and videos. He said we should meet up and we made arrangements, subject to whether or not he'd be able to get the day off work. 

Anyway, a few days before I'm meant to be seeing him, I'm on instagram's 'Following' page, which basically allows you to see what your friends are liking and commenting, and I see that he's liked a comment where he's being referred to as somebody's boyfriend. I immediately questioned him about it, and he explained that he is currently living with the girl whose 'boyfriend' he supposedly is because he had been made homeless. He said the only reason he's allowed to live at this girl's place is because her parents think he's in a relationship with her, and that he was going to keep up this facade until he could find his own place. It was a very elaborate explanation but because I was still skeptical I told him I wished to cease contact but that I wouldn't be speaking to his supposed 'girlfriend' about what I had seen. This was a mistake.

A few days ago I'm browsing instagram and I see a photo of him with this same girl. They've been on holiday together. I go onto her profile and I see that they moved into their own flat together just after I stopped talking to the guy. My stomach is churning like crazy because it means everything he'd told me was a lie. So I message her. I tell her it's okay if she's angry or upset with me but that I felt she deserved to know the truth. I send her a few screenshots, none of which are graphic, but which are good 'proof' of the claims I'm making about the guy. She is yet to reply. Even though I've been honest with her I'm worried that her main argument will be that I should've contacted her last year - despite the fact that information has only just come to light that has rendered the guy's explanation an absolute lie. AITA or do you think this has been a case of 'better late than never'?

TL;DR: Guy sent me sexual messages and intended to meet up with me. Claimed he was single. I only told his girlfriend a year later when I found out for certain he had been lying."		1	0

I was originally majoring in Bio, but decided that that wasn’t the path for me, and instead decided that I wanted to pursue English. I met with my advisor to discuss this, no issue over here.

Then my dad. I was just expecting him to drop me off at the university (I’m home for the summer and I can’t drive), and pick me up when my session with my advisor was finished. Instead, he followed me all the way to my advisor’s office and asked to sit in with me and join our discussion. The problem (and my advisor told him this) is that since we would be discussing my grades, I would need to sign off on a disclosure to my dad. Admittedly, it was more of a formality than anything, and my advisor said it was up to me whether I wanted my dad in the discussion or not. 

I said no, I did not want him in the room with us. Nothing personal, I just thought since I’m an adult now I should be making more important life altering decisions by myself. I also don’t think it’s his place to be involved that directly with my academic career. My parents have been pushing for me to be less dependent on them when it came to making life choices, so I thought my dad would understand and even support me.

And I was wrong. My father was pretty angry at me when I got out and met him in the car. He explained that since he’s the one playing for my education and taking out loans, he should have some say in how I choose to progress in my academic career, especially since I decided to change my major from a “secured job major” to an “unreliable major.” I can understand his frustration, especially since my first semester hasn’t been great grades wise. I’m at risk of losing my scholarship, and my performance has shown him that paying for my tuition would be a big financial risk now. When I mentioned this to my siblings and friends, they said that I was being ungrateful that my dad wanted to help and get involved. Still, this isn’t like I’m fresh out of high school and still need my parents involved in every single thing related to college.

So reddit, AITA?

Tl;dr: Dad mad cause I didn’t let him in on a academic advisor meeting because he pays for my tuition and has financial stakes in my success

EDIT; Just to clarify, the loans are being taken out in my name and my dad is co-signing them. While I do recognize that that he is still responsible for them and should have a say, I also have financial stakes in this decision."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I (22f) have been living abroad for 2 years. In july, I am going back to my home country.
To celebrate my last moments here, I asked 2 close friends/colleagues(30-ish) on a long weekend trip. The trip include renting a car, taking a ferry to an island and accomodation. 
I know that 1 of my friend (I'll call her A) has some difficulties financially at the moment (she's going through a rough divorce), but she agreed to join for the trip. She knew from the beginning we have to rent a car etc. I didn't give her an exact cost for the trip but she took some time to think about it ans then agreed. (I assumed she verified she was good for the trip).
I have to say it is not the first time I try to plan something with her and she cancels last minute because of her financial issues, but it's more like day-trips.
My other friend agreed for the trip so today I am looking at accomodations. I find a good compromise between something cosy but cheap considering her financial issue. It was one of the cheapest option I found. I send a text on WhatsApp about accomodation, price etc. and Ask if it is okay for everyone so I Can make the reservation. Friend B agrees, Friend A Ask if it is the cheapest option (i answered yes) and then agrees.
I confirm reservation right after(without refunding, I am stupid I know). 5 minutes later I receive a call from Friend A saying that she can't come because she doesn't have enough money for the trip, she just calculated. She also deleted her message saying she agreed on WhatsApp group. 
I didn't Say much on the phone, but I am definitely mad at her because she had plenty of time to think about it and refuse from the beginning or before I make the reservation. I don't know what to do now. 
The purpose of the trip was to spend time with the closest people I know here before leaving the country and go back.

by7hxd	2019-06-08 12:29:12		AITA for refusing to help my dad with video games anymore?	"My dad has taken an interest in video games recently, largely due tot he fact he has a lot more free time thanks to his retirement. 

When he first started getting into them, he had me come up with a list of games I’d though he’d like. I made a list with easy games for him to start out on (Tetris, Pac-Man, House Flipper and some colouring games) and some more complex stuff, including games I play like Battlefield, Fortnite and some MMOs.

While he has taken a likely and has become rather good at some of the easier games (He particularly like House Flipper), he is struggling with the more complex games, specifically with one MMO (won’t name as it will likely identify me to friends who sometimes visit this sub), while is one I play maybe twice a month.

The issues started when he kept asking me for help with how to play the game. I didn’t mind at first, and tried my best to help him. However, I’m simply not good at explaining things, I tend to be short and do get frustrated when people don’t understand (this is something I’m working on, along with my general anger issues).

Because of this, he doesn’t understand, and himself gets frustrated, which I understand is my fault. But when I suggest other methods of learning, like tutorials or video guides he will either refuse, say he didn’t understand or move onto another game before he’s properly learned something, only to come back and expect me to reteach him.

Things reach boiling point this morning when it came to combat. He’s learned the combat before by doing a tutorial, but left the game for a couple months and has since forgotten everything.

After a few easy to answer questions about flying mounts and how to earn gold he calls me in to ask about combat and how to works.

I tried to answer as well as I could, but my bluntness and the combat being something more easily shown than told got him annoyed. I tried to ask him to find a mob to kill so I could show him how it worked, as it is genuinely hard to simply explain, but he just got angrier.

He started yelling, saying I didn’t want to help him and that I’d rather be anywhere else. I snapped, said I won’t be helping him anymore and left.

After an hour of silence, he called me in and we talked again. He said he struggles with these games and he needs my help with them, and that I should help if I can.

I said I understand that, but it’s reached a point where I realised I’m not the one to help him. I said I’m not a good teacher and it stresses us both out when this happens, which isn’t good. I said I won’t help him further, and he’d need to find another teacher or rely on guides and/or tutorials for future help.

He said nothing, but look annoyed by this, and said we’d talk more later.

AITA for saying this? I genuinely think it’s the best thing for both of us at this point, as I’m a shitty, impatient teacher."		1	0

She recently came to visit me, and I revealed that I had gotten engaged to my long time boyfriend. She was really happy for both of us, but during her visit said a couple of really rude things. One was that when I told her a particular detail about my wedding plans, she went off on a bit of a tangent talking about how she didn't agree with it. The other was that she said I should call her mum myself and tell her that I had gotten engaged- she didn't want to be the one to tell her, and that her mum would like to hear it from me. I said I wouldn't because I knew her mum didn't approve of my relationship, and her mum has been quite rude to me in the past. This upset her. 

We left on frosty terms, and I decided to cut her out of my engagement party. We haven't spoken since, but she just called me asking why I didn't invite her (I put pictures up on social media, which she follows), and why I didn't even talk to her about what the problem was. She thinks it's petty to be throwing away nearly 20 years of friendship over this, but she never apologised for what she said, and at the end of the day its my engagement and I should have people that love me around me. Am I the asshole here?"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

Now the issue is, he has a cat. And he just assumed I would drop everything to go stay at his apartment to keep the cat company.

I'm more than happy to feed the cat, give him water, treats, and some loves but I have stuff to do. I was meant to drive from northern England to Wales yesterday to pick up my best friend who's living with me for the next 2 months before she immigrates. Her lease at her current place ends tomorrow, it's a 5 hour drive each way, and I want to go today so I'm not doing the round trip in one day.

Queue the drama - my boyfriend is pissed that I'm not spending tonight keeping his cat company. He's been going on and on about how the cat needs to have company or it gets stressed. I love this cat but honestly I'm the girlfriend, not the pet sitter and I can't drop everything to spend days with it. Not to mention I'm allergic to cats and any more than an hour around them is incredibly uncomfortable for me.

When she passed, her golden bracelet was given to her daughter, my mother. When I got married, my mother gave the bracelet to me on my wedding day,  as I live the furthest away from my parents, and I’d only see them at most once a year. My mother said it was a token to remind of home and our culture and where we came from. My mother didn’t mention anything about having them returned at any time. 

Fast forward two years later, my brother announced he was getting married. I am making the necessary arrangements to get home where my mother casually requested I returned my grandmothers bracelet. This was to be given to my brothers wife, as in my culture, he is the new head of the household. I tell my mother no. My mother is disappointed, claims it’s not mine to hold on to, that I’ve forgotten my roots, tells me I’m not around to take care of my parents and I should return it as it is hers. While I am extremely far away from them, I’ve never stopped giving them money and even though my brother lives with them, he is generally less dependable, financially.

Came across a brand new builder that had two houses being built next to each other in the area we wanted. Both were 3BR house that were $20K different in prices. We chose the cheaper house due to layout and lighting (but had less square footage). But really debated between both houses.   

We were first to build with them so they were initially great about upgrades but always felt the need to let us know they wouldn’t do this for every house- only ours since that was the beauty of customizing a house with them. Towards the end when we wanted things (things they initially promised were “included”) they started to get shitty and said these things would have to come out of our “budget” for upgrades. Let me say we picked everything- floor, light fixtures, knobs, paint colors, cabinets etc. We spent 8 hours just picking and finding the lights in the house. Searched for the perfect pieces and then sent link to builder to buy items for house.   

Fast forward- we move in to house in April. Other house is nearly finished but not yet sold. We went to open house and literally they got every single one of our upgrades (without having to negotiate for it). They have the same exact kitchen cabinets including handles (these are also in all the bathrooms) as well as the same bathroom lights we picked (searched and found online). We overheard them hint that the house price is now decreasing again (which means it will be comparable to ours) and they are offering a custom trek deck to the buyer of neighboring house as well as a “large incentive gift” (we didn’t get either of these).

We are rather annoyed as now the house next to ours is slightly bigger, looks incredibly similar to ours inside and they get a trek deck for same price.   Is it reasonable for us to be annoyed with this? We feel like although we got to “customize” our home given that they mimicked everything next door it looks more like their brand now than our personal picks (I.e. they’re emulating our choices and making these items staples to their brand).

Then the puppies are born they are 4 weeks old as of now. 
In the 4 weeks i have been told a few things. One the dog must be created (we don't like this idea for many reason). Next we had a dog years ago that stayed under the stairs in our home. (No door closet gave her the run of a hall way gated off when we were gone or eating. 15 ft by 4 1/2 ft room ) This wasn't okay with her. Then now she wants to breed said dog for puppies (if it were our choice we would get her fixed, just a preference level). All of this above we were to deal with. Then she flat out told me said dog will have a name of an nother pet already at our home, her words were deal with it. This was done over text's, around 2pm yesterday. Mind you i said nothing trying to find the nice way untill my SO gets home. Him and i talk about it, he says he don't want the dog now, Nor do i. We can go buy a dog without so many strings. So i texted her around 5 pm somthing along the lines of ""*** and i have talked, he is gonna go get us another dog. Seeing we are ready for our family to have a dog. There are to many strings attached with your, strings that we feel will only hurt our kids in the long run. So this way there aren't any strings attached and no one gets hurt. I'm sorry for any confusion this has caused. Good luck with your puppies they sure are cute.""
About 10 mins later my phome rings it's in the same room SO is in, he picks it up to get cursed out, he hangs up on her. He texted her from my phome he will just go pay for a dog if she is going to act like this. I came back to said room and he starts telling me what happened. I block her, but all the messages she sent after this go to my blocked box. I guess from what she is saying i wasn't civilized about the choice of not wanting said dog. That I'm worthless, and refuse to have fun. Not to contact her or my father. Btw not the 1st time she has just flaked out. I want to go no contact with her, because life would be so much better without having to walk on egg shells around her.

So I've(24) been working at this job for roughly 7 months, it's in retail banking.  I grasped the job pretty well, though I was doing well I was still nervous as I never worked in this industry before and it's peoples money, like their lives, so I didn't want to make any mistakes and keep my work accurate.  Additionally, accuracy is very highly valued in this company, and grounds for termination if too many mistakes happen &nbsp;

So after about 2 months of training, I was on my own, sharing the Teller line with 3 others, one of which I'll call ""Coworker A""(23) or ""A"" from here on in, as they are the issue here.  almost immediately after training and being relatively new to this job I transition to helping actual customers, as expected I made a few mistakes but there's certain leniency for new hires.  my other coworkers helped me learn each procedure pretty well, they walked me through it, gave me pointers and never shamed me for doing badly.  &nbsp;

About 2 and half months into the job, still in my learning phase, i noticed that A would be rather pushy with me, in the sense that she wouldn't explain things very well, and just take over my transactions instead of helping me ( which we had certain sales goals so this kinda frustrated me). Additionally, A started asking me all kinds of questions,  some as simple as "" what are you having for dinner tonight?"" and some would be what I consider a bit inappropriate for work, example ""do you think child molesters have an actual disease or are they just bad people"" it seems like a jump between the two questions, but they happened literally one right after the other, and this was a daily occurrence for about a week.  &nbsp;

I felt uncomfortable because of these constant questions ( a few every half hour or so) I would get upset, and nervous because I wouldn't be able to focus.  Then A started asking questions about my sexual life.  an example would be "" do you have any fetishes? what are your fetishes?""  this was on the floor not in a break room. I did talk to my Boss once about it, he didn't discipline A, life went on. a month or so later A had actually given out my Personal information to a customer, who I did not know at all ( breaking a strict rule about privacy) this lead to me admittedly acting passive aggressive about the incident until it blew up and A freaked out on me yelling at me like I did something wrong and claiming ""its not like they are gonna rob you or something"" &nbsp;

Now I'm leaving the job, the stress is too much and I have made too many mistakes (IMO) Some other rules A would break are: Being late ( 10 mins ), Sleeping at their station, Violating company procedure in many aspects of the job. there's more but char limit so ill answer questions in comments. &nbsp;

so reddit AITA for wanting to report this coworker even though I'm leaving the job? &nbsp;

EDIT: I forgot to add the whole reason I'm unsure of reporting A is that they are a single Parent, and I don't want to ruin some little kid's(like 3) childhood over their parent being fired, also when I say constant rulebreaker I mean literally every day, multiple times a day I can elaborate on what actions she specifically did but I don't know if edits count towards character limit"	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I'm not ready for sex yet, but we do make-out a lot and I'd say we're at second base. That's all I'm ready for right now and he's always respected that. Our hour long make-out sessions are far from boring, so it's not like he's never touched my chest before.

I'm super ticklish. I always thought tickling was just some of the cute stuff we did. Like tickle fights were ""our thing"" and they always happen them after a funny debate (usually hip-hop related). It was part of the banter. But I'm so ticklish that I barely manage to tickle him back.  

So my boyfriend and I were chilling in his friends basement. They were all smoking and shit, I was just there for the banter. They're chill guys.

We were debating who's verse was better on a track and then a little ticklefight happened. 

The other guys stopped their conversations and it was silent. They were just looking at us, but trying not to.

I thought that they were weirded out by the PDA, so I told my boyfriend to really stop and apologized.They said it's cool and they didn't mind. One guy said to feel free to keep going on. 

Then my boyfriend had a ""yo, wtf guys"" moment. His friend said he can't get mad at them for looking at the reason he's tickling me in the first place. I was confused. 

To summarize that group conversation (which made shit way weirder), he tickles me because of the way my chest moves. I do have a really large chest that I used to feel self-conscious about. I guess when being tickled, there's more movement.  My boyfriend admitted to it.

My boyfriend told them to stop because they're making me uncomfortable. He tried to put his arm around me, but I really didn't want him to touch me. Another friend said I can't be mad because my bf wants to see his girlfriends boobs. 

I was really upset and didn't want him to touch me for the rest of the day. 

It's not like I'm never going to let him touch me, but it's not something I'm welcome too. A touch that I thought was just fun and innocent, was really about something sexual. I feel like this perverted what I thought was a really wholesome part of our relationship. I didn't know about this :(.

The past few nights I’ve gone out with my good friend who’s been through a lot with me the past year, I’ve done this with 2 guys that she “likes” but hasn’t done anything about and doesn’t go for them and they have no idea or any inclination that she has feelings for them. Anyway, she’ll get annoyed and we’ll talk about it but nothing has ever happened with me or either of the guys, I’ll just tell them they’re hot or ask them if they wanna makeout but nothing ever comes from it. Last night she was extremely upset with me after I shotgunned a beer with a guy and then “tried to hold hands with him” even though I was just reaching for something that was in his hands??? I literally didn’t touch him or anything but she stopped talking to me for the night and I ended up crying and taking myself home.

A friend of mine is doing a birthday cashpool for his boyfriend's birthday in July, she wants to give him a generous gift that should cost around $400, thus she created a whatsapp group with all of their friends (30-40 people) to ask them if they want to participate.

Now, I don't mind putting money in a cashpool for some special events, but I don't like that here it's managed by her bf, let alone that it's not an anonymous poolcash and you can see who put money and how much. 

Also, in that case, she keeps pressuring people into participating with ""friendly reminders"" every 2-3 days, and it starts to really bug me. Because I'm not sure if I want to give money for someone I seldom talk to, and because of her demeanor to push people for their participation. It makes people participation barely genuine.

Finally I asked my friend if she planned to do a party for his bf for his birthday so that we could give him his gift altogether, to which she replied that no they were already taken that night so they couldn't host a party. 

This really threw me because i think you can't expect a gift from your friend if you don't even take the time to prepare a party for them to enjoy; it's kind of a two-way thing.

If I’m still asleep sometimes my wife will tell me to get up and take care of the baby so she doesn’t have to do it. AITA for telling her no and that I want to get a little extra sleep on weekend mornings?

EDIT: I help my wife with our baby every evening and on the weekends. I obviously do not do as much to care for our child due to the fact that I am not with our child as much. I do help my wife with the parenting responsibilities during the week and on weekends. Sometimes I just wanna sleep in because I’m up so early every day. My wife and baby are still asleep everyday when I leave for work.

EDIT2: My wife works extremely hard and I understand that. She works harder than me probably. This isn’t about me not wanting to help with our baby. This is about me wanting to get a little bit more sleep on the days I can sleep past 445-530.

EDIT3: When I said helping I mean helping my wife with the responsibilities of being a parent. They are shared responsibilities and I try to help my wife by taking on responsibilities when I am home."	No A-holes here	0	0

by6stl	2019-06-08 10:51:44	notafanofusernames-	AITA for doing less and asking for more?	"So I’m currently traveling around China with one of my friends. He’s a Chinese national and I’m a foreigner. We usually speak in whichever language is more private, which is primarily English. It can be very difficult for me to understand non-standard Mandarin and people usually turn to him when we go places because he’s Chinese and they assume I can’t speak any Chinese (which I don’t really mind). 

So on this trip he’s making most of the decisions about where we go and where we stay. I’m more of go with the flow kind of guy so it doesn’t really bother me where we go, whereas he HAS to do certain things or else he feels like the day was wasted. Cool, I don’t mind going to see the things he wants to see. 

So I couple of issues have arisen and I’m not really sure who is being the asshole. We’ll go out to a restaurant and sometimes he’ll just mark off foods and handover the menu to the waitress without even glancing in my direction. Now I won’t say I’m that picky, but sometimes I’m just not in the mood for pig brains, cow stomach, and goose intestines. So I’ll call him out for not even giving me a chance to look at the menu and then he goes on a rant about how we HAVE to eat these things in this city, how if I wanted to order something differently I could’ve done it myself (this is an issue because even though my chinese is pretty decent a lot of these places use very strange names for their dishes and I honestly can’t understand them, but nevertheless he tells me he will NOT translate the menu for me), and if this is how I feel I can just go to another restaurant by myself.

Then he’ll go on a rant about how he has planned everything and that if I want a say then I need to plan things. I’ve tried this. One night when we were in Hong Kong he “allowed” me to choose a restaurant and so I did, but we were both already pretty hungry when I decided on it and he got pretty pissy with me when it took me five minutes to find the location of the restaurant. So I just let him go back to choosing things. 

 He’s pretty good at figuring out things to do, booking hotels, tickets, etc. I’m really thankful for what he’s done for us on this trip and I try to express my gratitude to him whenever it’s appropriate. But, when we go out to eat or if there’s something I want to do, shouldn’t I be able to have a say? He’s not a bad guy, but I feel like I’m having to follow a lot of rules. Whenever I get upset about it, he gets upset, MUCH more upset than I was originally. Am I the asshole for asking for too much when he’s putting in a lot more work for the trip than I am? 

I want to make it clear that he’s really not a bad person and he’s pretty reasonable 99% of the time. I’ve had a lot of fun on this trip and he’s one of my best friends."	No A-holes here	0	0

(details in desc)"	"Okay so yesterday afternoon I was lying on the bed when my room mate tell me that he smelled a smoke and told me to check where the source from as he believed that the smoke is a result of a house fire on a different floor. I did but began feeling uncomfortable when reaching just outside the house and directly near the place where you can see upfloors and downfloors (haven't figured out what is the technical name for it - I'm not into civil engineering).

I just felt that I can't proceed further and thus I have to make an on-the-spot judgement based on available information. Since I heard sounds that mimic or resemble that of ordinary cooking I told him that it was just ordinary cooking activities.


As the apartment I'm living in has many Middle Easterners (ffs I'm living in Malaysia) as residents and it's not unheard of that they often cooked food like that or even barbecued it, and as there is no black smoke coming up there and there is neither a cry for help nor sounding fire alarms, I stood by the assumption that it was just ""cooking activities"", or perhaps to a further extent, cooking gone wrong (for example accidentally cooking that with a plastic container still on) which was quickly rectified.


My roommate still insist that it was something else and that there may be an ongoing fire accident but I stood by my assumption and it immediately developed to a very nasty argument. Finally I fed up and shouted at him along the lines of ""that's your opinion"" and ""then we are in a deadlock in terms of opinion"", along with f-words and the word ""period"". He just went mad and shouted that I'm an idiot. Then afterwards he went down to check it out and said that it was a bed that is on fire, and the Indian girl living down there was stupid to not sound the alarm bells or use the extinguisher.

As you can see the cooking assumption might sound dumb but at that time I had to make a quick judgement *based on available information*. My father might counter that with his usual ""would you be like that to your bosses if you're working in x or y"" trope upon learning about this, but in this case I think that is just straight-up comparing apples to oranges because I read somewhere that when you encounters situation like this, your so-called lizard part of the brain dominates you and you just harp on anything that you can think of on no matter it's rational or not.

As of the time of writing my throat is still feeling as if it's f'ed up."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

However, later on she changed her mind and realized she wasn’t wanting anything serious. I wasn’t really hurt since we only started talking and it happens to me so often I expect it a this point. I was really disappointed though and was upset that I was right about how it was going to go. She had ,however, invited me to be her date to a wedding a couple days before this all happened. She had said if I still wanted to go she was okay with it. I was still down to go since I never been to a wedding and always hoped in going to one and then also maybe get a chance to convince her it could work out between us. Later the day she messages me saying that 

“Im just gonna take ma girl  because this is gonna complicate things.”

And then i was a dumbass and asked

“So you don’t want me to go though then?”

But I didn’t mean it like an asshole being sarcastic. I was genuinely disappointed and meant it like damn I guess I won’t get a chance to prove we could work and I really wanted to go since again never been to one and I love the idea of love working out. I realized that well since we aren’t probably going to continue to talk I will just part ways by saying, 

“What kind of stupid question is that of course you don’t or else you wouldn’t have. I guess we aren’t going to continue to talk but it was nice when we did. I enjoyed it and made me happy for a bit lol so I hope your things go well and everything you wanted you get. Sadly I didn’t get chance to try again into not make the kiss uncomfortable 😂 Have fun at the wedding.”

I genuinely meant this and I really do want was the best for her because she was really cool. But she replied with

“Thanks for being a fucking ass saying a stupid ass question. Don’t disrespect me because I have not once disrespected you but I was honest and if you’re hurt keep it to yourself idgaf don’t talk to me like that.”

I was kind of shocked because i meant what i said but after a few hours I realized i sounded pretty condescending. So I tried to explain to her that in no way I meant disrespect and the whole kiss thing and emoji was just to lighten the mood but she had blocked me on everything.

"About 3months ago, my mom was assaulted by my sibling (29, mental health issues) he pushed her over in an argument and she broke her femur. We decided as a family to not press charges against sibling due to siblings intellectual disabilities and the inability of the justice system/prisons to provide appropriate support to people with intellectual disabilities, and keep them safe. 

She’s had a slow but steady recovery and is now walking with a stick but can’t drive or go places on her own. Previous to the assault she was quite depressed and smoked and drank a lot. I’ve talked to her about getting mental health support (accessible and affordable in my part of the world) and she’s always refused v defensively and said she’s managing on her own (she’s self medicating imo) I have a lot of sympathy as I know myself how hard it is to take that first step towards support and the fact that’s she confronting huge amounts of trauma inc childhood stuff. 
 
Now she’s at home all the time her smoking and drinking have increased. My dad buys for her 200 cigarettes a week (per her request she can’t drive and get them herself) and she generally gets through them. My dad has said we need to speak to her and he’s really worried as she has a rly bad cough and is struggling with her health. I’ve said I think he needs to stop buying her 200 cigarettes a week and a cask of wine  and we need to talk to her about the health effects of smoking and drinking  that much but I’m worried that we’ll be punishing an already deeply fragile, traumatised person and taking away more of her autonomy?"

Formatting on mobile, English is my first language, I’m just trash at writing. Names have been changed. 

So! I’ve known this woman, Samantha, since I was 11. She’s been my dads friend since like their 30’s or something. She’s always been nice to me, super understanding and supportive, unlike some women in my life. 
Her current situation is absolute shit. She’s losing her house, her son is in jail, her daughter is in Cali and she just had a baby (okay that part is good) but other than that, she has no one. So she called up my dad two nights ago looking for financial help. He declined, bec he’s broke af but offered me up as an “I’m sorry I can’t pay you but here’s my daughter”. Fucking great. 

So I talk to her and tell her I’ll meet her at her place close to 6pm. Apparently the sherif has been nagging her to GTFO because the house was foreclosed and sold at auction (idk if those are the right words) so she needs to be out by Monday. Okay, that blows but I’m ready and willing even though I have a 2-3rd degree burn on my back and moving is difficult. 

I get there, and see just piles of absolute garbage piled up over my head (I’m 5’8) and I’m thinking “good god no”. Then the smell hits. I almost threw up in my mouth. I’ve seen some shit but this is the epitome. She has cats and we find cat poop just scattered in her things. The smell of urine dominates the clothes. Oddly enough, this isn’t my breaking point. We start trying to clear a path through this mess and about an hour in, I’m feeling itchy on my legs. I look down to see that my legs are covered in little red blobs. I still don’t know if they are mosquitoes (I’m allergic) or fleas or just fly bites, but it’s been 8 hours and I gotta take some Benadryl. 

At this point, I realized I couldn’t stay. I can deal with a lot but bug bites on my sunburn do not fit the criteria. So I texted my roomie “defcon 5” and this triggered an emergency protocol where the other person makes frantic phone calls to the other so they can yeeeet outta there. 

I get home, shower and report back to my father who is concerned about Samantha’s mental state. 


Anyway. So now I’m at a crossroad. Do I go back and finish what I can out of pity and respect or do I just say I can’t (very true) and allow her to melt down. This woman effectively has nothing and no one. I wish I knew the right answer but currently I’m super itchy so i figures is ask reddit. 


Thanks guys

by6kt2	2019-06-08 10:17:13	SebastianSilver	AITA for telling my friends about my manipulative and abusive ex?	"This particular ex and I dated for less than a month. She told me she loved me about a month after we met and before we started dating. When we went on our first date, she said ""I know you're depressed, but try to smile and act happier at least, because you're bringing my mood down.""

In hindsight, there were hundreds of red-flags, but then again, hindsight is 20/20.

I broke things off with her because I realized I was still in love with someone else, and not with her. I broke up with her less than a week after realizing this.

I came to realize she was a very manipulative person before, during, and after we were dating. She would start off with being okay with what I wanted, and then slowly push me into doing what she wanted.

Example: There were several times near the end of our relationship when I did not want to sleep with her. She would say ""If you dont want to do it tonight, that's fine. I dont want you to be uncomforable."" To which I would respond ""Okay, I dont want to do anything tonight.""

""Okay. Well, it just kinda makes me feel like you dont love me. It makes me feel like you think I'm ugly."" This would continue until she guilted me into sleeping with her.

We both had one of the other's blankets, and she left my blanket on my doorstep. When I unfolded the blanket, I saw a six page letter detailing what an awful person I am.

Many parts of the letter were typed in caps, bold, italics, underlined, in red, or some combination of those things.

In the letter, she gets mad at me for forgiving her ""ex"" because ""right now, he's still an asshole."" I had forgiven him for ""cheating"" on her, because they never started dating so he was free to see whoever he felt. He was also dealing with major depression, which I felt I could help with as he lived two doors down from me in our dorms.

She humble brags about going to events such as choir concerts and piano recitals she didnt want to attend, which she never told me when we dated.

She tells me she's going to take my friends away from me (which she successfully did with my best friend and the girl I mentioned I actually loved.)

She tells me that I made her want to hurt herself AND brings up three that she ""saved my life"" when I was deep in my depression (which I'm not anymore, thank God) and she says that I had better be grateful and appreciate her because I owe her my life.

I decided to show my friends the letter because it was the only proof I had of the kind of person she was. She even says at the end, ""if you show this letter to your friends, I hope you dont change a single word, because I believe I have been appropriately angry and blunt.""

by6jpt	2019-06-08 10:12:35		AITA for not firing my son's ex from a family restaurant under the guise of tardiness issues.	"My sons, husband and I all run a family restaurant. It is a VERY successful business and a staple with our family.

**Our restaurant is like our second home, especially for my sons.** That's a crucial aspect. We spend most of our time here, even when we aren't working. We have a floor upstairs above it & that's where they'll hang out. Even if someone doesn't have a shift, they'll hang around there or bring friends over. It's what has made us such a close family unit. It is more ""home"" than the place our beds our beds are in. I can't stress enough how much of a home it is. Our whole lives are here.

**One of my younger sons is 19 and we gave his girlfriend a part-time hostess job at our restaurant. They've since broken up. Her family struggles a lot financially. Only I know the extent of her family's poverty and I always let her take several meals home.** 

My husband insists on firing her because of the toll it's taking on our sons emotional state. I think thats wrong.

After going back and forth, my husband gave me more details. 

He trusted my husband with details of the break-up because he was so distraught. The pair experienced their first time (hers, not his) after he did everything to make sure she was ready. Afterwards, she decided that she was wrong about being ready and can't be with him anymore. She regretted that it happened before marriage & she doesn't even look at him. I know it's weird for me to know about his sex life, but it's relevant to his heartbreak. They shared a special moment in love one week and she won't look at him the next. She refused to even try to work through it. She didn't want to. My husband says this would fuck up ANYONE and I agree. 

Apparently it's hard seeing her all the time and he's been absolutely miserable. He can never get away from her. She broke his heart and know he has to face her in a place that's home. He has said it's like seeing her in his own bedroom. He cried to my husband about it. My husband says that if he opened about it, it must be tearing him apart. We can alleviate so much of the pain. He says that we won't fire her for ""the breakup"" but for another reason.

**She's good at doing her job when she's there, but family obligations usually leave her late.  We never made it an issue.**

**He says that we aren't firing her for breaking up, we're firing her for late. We'll put her on probation for her constant lateness, say 2 back to back lates without a doctors note and you're fired. He says that's reasonable for any job. He says that we're really just stopping special treatment for her. I agree, but it's only because of the breakup. This was never an issue.** 

Then he accused me of keeping her because she's like a daughter to me & we've only had boys...That started another argument.

It hurts that my son is hurting. But in the real world, you don't fire people after a breakup. He says this is different & I know it."	Not the A-hole	1	0

by6cjp	2019-06-08 09:44:10	IsItWireD	AITA for cutting ties with my father 10y ago and refusing to resume communication?	"(Scroll for tldr)
My entire family (mum, bro, myself) was hostage to my father's moods. He spent his time isolating us, bullying us, gaslighting us, screaming at us for hours until we cried (or threw up in the case of my brother), throwing landline phones or chairs at my mother (but never actually hitting her, which used to make me think this wasn't *really* bad), and more, until the divorce.

When i hit puberty it became even nastier so I refused to see him and he'd call me a 100 times a day until hearing the phone ring would make me retch, stand in front of my mum's building for hours, scaring the neighbours and occasionally breaking the glass door.
As an adult I went to see him twice a year which led to tons of guilt tripping (5 min after getting to his place for xmas: ""so what do you want to eat next year xmas when you come again?""). I told him I wouldn't take any insult directed at my mother, he'd say ""you know it's not your mum's fault if she is stupid"", which he was really adamant did not qualify as insulting her.

Because I'm petty as hell, what truly prompted me to cut ties was that whenever I opposed him, he'd act as if he was proud of me for ""standing up for myself"".
I realised he was trying to turn this into a ""I made you tough"" narrative and I was not having it. I ghosted him. He sent me 4 letters that all start with ""Well I dont know what I did to you but I'm sorry"". They were promptly binned.

*The twist*: my father has a severe undiagnosed mental illness which contributed to making him this way, notably by ""making him"" an alcoholic, leading to him being unemployed for almost his entire life. I have this same mental illness but much less severe, so I know what it's about. Regardless, he still made the choice to torture us, and not by accident: he brought my mum into his country only to forbid her to learn the language. He then was obsessed with only having daughters (because women are weak and easily controllable, amirite), when my brother was born he was so mad he didn't hold him for the first 6months of his existence. My brother took his 1st steps because my father was screaming and he was trying to get away from him.

Whether or not they know this, people who seem to think I am in the wrong here insist I should forgive my father and resume communication, for... closure?
What I'm thinking is I dont need to forgive anyone! I moved on and this is not part of my life anymore. Speaking to him means teaching him about how much of an ass he is and trying to make him see the light. I feel the efforts would be at 90% coming from me and I'm over this, not a project I am interested in. Besides, would it not be better for him to die alone not knowing - he isnt even really alone because my brother is a selfless angel and takes care of him.

TLDR; My father made my childhood a nightmare but partly due to an undiagnosed mental illness.
Also I'm super petty and I know my decision is somewhat linked to that.

A few years into our friendship I discovered that H is very self-centered. It had gotten very toxic so I started distancing her right before she moved away for graduate school. We eventually stopped contacting each other all together for about three years. We then reconnected and reconciled after meeting up a few times. I thought she had changed for better at the time. Shortly after, I got engaged to my now husband. When H heard about it, the first thing she said to me was ""You're gonna include me in your wedding party, right?"" and I agreed. I later regretted for not turning H down.

Fast forward to a few months before my wedding. H ordered her dress and shipped it directly to me. Mind you that she lives a few states away from me and wasn't going to be in town until three days before. I had warned her that she might want to ship it to her home to try it and get tailored if needed. But she didn't listen. She also insisted on ordering the standard sized dress instead of a custom sized one after I had told her the MOH and the other MB both received their custom sized dresses and didn't need any tailoring.

On Thursday before the wedding, I gave her the dress as soon as she arrived. She didn't try on until Friday night (wedding was on Sunday) and broke down because it was a tad larger and at least 3-4 inches too long with her heels on. I had already warned her about it so I decided to igonre her. I was fine if she had to hold the dress up for the entire wedding. H was whining the whole night and my MOH was too nice to ignore her so MOH begged her 70yo mom to hem the dress. The poor lady worked 12 hours straight the next day to hem the dress. I thanked the mom for all she's done at 8pm. H thanked her as well but went on to complain the sides still don't fit.

I was so disappointed in her already at this point on how unapologetic and ungrateful she is. Then during the wedding reception, H's conversation with the guests mainly consisted of complaining how hard grad school is and how badly her colleagues and professor treated her. She also told a few guests it's ok to get the cake before we cut it. The wait staff noticed there's a hole on one side of the cake and managed to hide it for our cake cutting. During our after party, she pretended to be drunk and tried to come on to one of the groomsmen whose gf couldn't join b/c of work. H was so ""drunk"" the guy had to help carry her to the car.

After the wedding, I'm so tired of this drama queen and don't want to see her again. My husband is totally cool with my idea. Best friend told me no b/c H and I have known each other for so long and that I should still attend her graduation later this year. So WIBTA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0
by666d	2019-06-08 09:17:05		AITA For Keeping My Bedroom Locked All The Time ?	"I am honestly confused that being overprotective over my room could hurt someone's feelings , and my mom is saying it's my fault here so I need you guy's opinion on where I went wrong .

About a year ago me , my parents and 3 little sisters moved into a new double storey house . It had 4 rooms so I picked the smallest one upstairs for myself as long as I'm guaranteed my privacy . I absolutely love my privacy as I'm an introvert , and my bedroom is where I study , sleep , spend most of the time in and sometimes even eat . Naturally I keep a lot of my stuffs in there so I'm very protective over my room . 

I don't like it when my sisters enter my room and I always scold them if they even tried to . I've gotten into huge fights with one of my sis who actually entered and took something from my room without my permission . My bedroom is like a temple to me and I never allow anyone inside , not even my cousins .

So now my grandma and my aunt had come over to my house for the holidays to take care of us since my mom was out to India . My grandma is notorious for going around the house and snooping everything , it has gotten to a point where my mom gave me a huge file of our important documents to me before she went to India and told me to keep it safe in my room since I don't allow anyone inside and keep it closed or locked all the times .  

I was extra on-guard after they arrived so maybe I wasn't too careful about my actions . One day my grandma sent my sister to me asking for a toilet brush to clean the toilet in the master bedroom , so I went up , unlocked my room , went in and got the toilet brush from my toilet and passed it to her . 

I made sure to lock my room before I went down and my grandma did notice this action of mine . I didn't think much of this and just went about my day . Later I was informed by the same little sister ( who overheard this conversation between my grandma and my aunt ) that my grandma was upset at me because I was treating her like she was a house maid . She's basically saying she felt like I was treating them like they were strangers in the house . 

This was something that I do on a daily basis , but I never thought my grandma could get hurt by this . After listening to this my mom also said that I am in fault here , but she was the one who told me to safeguard the documents though ? Also grandma will 100% snoop in my room when I'm away and I'm uncomfortable with that , but I do feel some kind of way after hearing this from my sister . Do you guys think I am truly TA ?"

by62ve	2019-06-08 09:03:23	Key_Youth	AITA for not feeling close enough to my father to want to celebrate his birthday?	"I stumbled upon the post about the guy who never gave his daughter any love/affection past the age of 7 and holy fuck, it’s like I’m reading my life story.

My father turned 60 the other day. I’ve never called him ‘Dad’ because it always felt somewhat weird. He’s a cold, reserved man who never praised me for anything (even when I got into the top school in my country, published a book at 20, graduated uni with the highest score possible and found a lucrative job). He’s never once told me he loves me, when he hugs me at the airport (when I come home for Christmas as I live abroad), it’s always super awkward because we literally never do this. He doesn’t value my opinion and has never gone out of his way to do something nice for me (I literally had to beg him for an hour in my teen years to give me a ride). 

So, he celebrated his 60th with my immediate family on the day. However, he’s also planning a second celebration with his friends over the weekend: it’s in the next city and I don’t have my license so I need to rely on someone to drive me there and back.

I have expressed reluctance to go. I could spend time with my friends that I rarely see, read a book and catch up on my writing but as soon as I even suggested I don’t go, he went livid. I was called ungrateful, mean, spoiled by both my parents and my grandparents, told that I am disrespecting my father, etc.

My mother said it’s like I don’t love/respect him ... but I guess this is kinda true. Don’t get me wrong, I’m really grateful that they gave me food and shelter for 18 years and supported me in college (college here is free so no tuition fees) but that’s about it. I feel closer, more supported and loved by my friends than my family. 

My father is currently giving me the cold shoulder treatment and has said he won’t drive me to the airport when it’s time for my flight. My entire family is droning about how mean I am and expressing that I’m in the wrong and basically am a shitty daughter for not wanting to go.

Was I the asshole in expressing my lack of desire to celebrate his 60th birthday?"	Not enough info	0	0

The only time I've really gone on a date with someone and continued seeing them was with someone I'll call Donna.

Donna and I meet for our third date, and we're having a conversation about something when she leans in toward me then hesitates and says she can't do this, revealing that she can't afford to stay in our city and is moving away. I tell her that I like her very much, and that I'm happy to spend any amount of time with her and ask if she's interested in something casual until she goes. Donna strongly rebuffs that, but doesn't say how I can stay in her life.

I figure that we can at least be friends.

She notes that some of her coworkers are meeting elsewhere at the mall, and we go to see them, where they are waiting at a restaurant. I feel like a ninth wheel, and after I make a bad pun to her, she says, ""Get outta here"". I decided to take that as an invitation to leave, and go home without informing her.

She was unhappy about that. I've never seen her since.

The few months that she’s been here she has borrowed money from me and when she pays me back she’ll ask for more a couple days later. Sometimes she’ll pay me back on time but other times she’ll make up excuses and asks to pay me next week. One time she owed me money she bought $180 shoes and that made me have to constantly remind her to pay me back, She gets annoyed at this and tells me that I act like she never pays me back, but she recently went on two trips two the beach and she blew $50 dollars in gas in one day that she borrowed from me and asked me the next for $20. I told her that I was going to lend anymore after and she was going to have to start saving her money from now on. She was okay with it, but when it came time to pay me she said she didn’t get paid enough because she was sick a couple of days. I got angry with her because she knew she only worked those couple of days, yet she kept asking me to lend her more and her excuse was that she didn’t know how much they were going to take out in taxes.

I told my mum that if she was actually going to allow this I would call CPS, she told me I'm the sister not the mother so I have no right to call CPS. 

so I called them.

by5ucj	2019-06-08 08:24:15	CSnare	AITA For Failing My Best Friend’s Paper After She Went Through A Horrible Break-up?	"For some context, I TA one of my best friend’s classes and was put in charge of grading essays.

My best friend Lily and I have been close for 3 years now, and we’ve known each other since high school. She was in a relationship with a man I’ll call Marc, and they were crazy about each other. They were super cute together, and they were together for a year before I met Lily. 

They did everything together, and they were the dysfunctional couple in the sense that they literally never fought about anything. They were both so kind to each other, and seeing them together always made my little heart melt.

But, one day Lily came home from her job and caught him cheating. Out in the open, on the couch with some random girl. He left and hasn’t contacted her since.

Of course, she was devastated. She kinda went AWOL for a week after she caught him. She wouldn’t talk to anyone, or even leave her apartment for that matter.  I did my best to cheer her up, but I could only do so much. She was heartbroken, and I would have been too.

But, she had to get on with life. I told her that dwelling on it would only make her feel worse. And that she had a big paper due the following Monday that I knew she hadn’t started because of the breakup.

Well, come the day it’s due, and she comes to me after class and hands me her essay. I was proud of her, at a first glimpse it looked like she actually pulled herself together and wrote a decent essay for her class.

Wrong. And I mean this in the nicest way possible- it was like reading overly symbolistic creative writing from an angsty 12 year old. It was not a good essay. So I failed her.

She confronts me about it once she sees her grade, and she got suuuper angry. She said things like “You KNEW I was going through a rough time, why can’t you just cut me some slack?” 

“I would have done the same for you, what does that say for our friendship?”

“I understand you have responsibilities, but you could have cut corners, you’ve done it before (true, but it wasn’t a major assignment.)”

“Am I just not important to you? I can’t understand why you would give other people slack but not me!”

And of course, I got a little defensive.

“You deserved to fail, your paper wasn’t very good. The person I cut corners for was on the line. You are not.”

“I have a job to do, and you shouldn’t jeopardize that. It’s selfish of you to assume I’d risk losing my job just for some paper you wrote.”

So yeah. She just got mad at me, stormed off, and we haven’t spoken since. (it’s been about a week). On one hand I feel bad because I would have hated that to happen to me, but on the other hand any other grown adult would have failed her, and I don’t understand why it should be different because it was me.

I have been working at a entry level position for roughly two months, it's probably the worst job I have ever been at. We have three managers two of them are assistant, they all have different opinions on how things should be done and also have no respect for a good portion of the employees.

Every time that I am told to do something I get yelled at for doing what I was told by another person, and this is most often a manager conflict.

 For example: I was yelled at for doing a task that I was requested of by the general manager, it wasn't because I didn't do something right or because I skipped a step. It was because this other manager likes to take control of all the situations and has most notably got me in trouble in the past four things that are simply not my fault.

One manager tells you to do one thing while the other to tell you to do two entirely different things and then get upset at you for doing what the others say. The business always feels like it's about to fall into chaos.

We are short on people, but it's not like any of them treat me like decent  human beings anyway. The managers and all the other employees are close friends while I'm a brand new person and I'm treated like an outsider, I have absolutely no say in anything that we do. I have had some of the managers actively insult or ridicule me.

I am absolutely finished with this business and we'll never go back, I have other places lined up that pay more."		1	0
by5ri8	2019-06-08 08:12:05	SouthernPomelo	AITA for ending the friendship with a person who manipulated me?	" 

First time posting and german. So sorry for any format or grammar mistakes.

This story happened twice days ago.

I go to high school where I have this friend circle that consists of  Fabiana, Joline, Eric and me. Fabiana is from another country and came  to our school only a year ago, but we became friends very quickly.  Joline and I are best friends for other ten years. But Eric was just...  there. I never saw him as a very good friend because we didn't do much  together.

One day, Fabiana, Joline and I got a letter from Eric telling us that  we were ""toxic"" because Joline and I liked Fabiana more than her. He  told us he was jealous. Of course we felt guilty and apologised more  than once.

But the day after that he just talked to us as if nothing happened.  We kinda figured that he wanted attention and left it at that.

Skip forward a couple weeks. Joline and I were going to the cinema to  watch Rocketman and we told Eric about it. He became so angry that I  thought He would harm us. Luckily he just screamed why we didn't take  him with us (we were going with my family that doesn't like him).

After that Joline and I talked about him and discovered that we were  never really friends with him and that he manipulated us - especially  me. 

Here are some of the things he did.

  \- never asked me anything, only talked about himself.

  \- loading his complete emotional package on me. 

 \- threatening me when I didn't comply with his bullshit.

  \- being angry when I did something with other people.

  \- criticised everything about me. From my ability to draw all the way  to the way my nose looks. (He told me my nose looked like a butt. Every  single fucking day.) I still have issues with my appearance and stopped  drawing because he would always make me feel like shit. I told him this  at many occasions but it didn't stop.

  \- overdramitisizing everything.

  \- trying to guilt trip me by saying that I'm the most important person  in his life.

  \- trying to date me although I said no multiple times.

  \- trying to get me to do things I didn't want in general.

  \- never seeing a problem in himself.

We've told him all those things at once. He cried and we ended the friendship. But I kinda feel bad now.

When I thought about it, I realized that a lot if my issues are  because of him. I have a fear of showing people things I've created.  It's not just embarrassing. I think that someone is going to criticise  the shit out if it. Just as Eric did all the past 5 years.

I told him that I'm done being everyone's emotional garbage. He told  me every little shitty detail of his life (her transsexuality being one  of that), but not asked me once about my problems.

Now he is probably villainizing us.

by5rfc	2019-06-08 08:11:41	isl_z	AITA for telling my dad how to discuss politics?	"I (16F) became increasingly interested in the politics of my very small European country. I have been watching debate shows non-stop to form my own, unbiased, opinion on parties and their politics. 
My father (51M) and I have always had a great relationship, and talk to each other about everything - from love to philosophies and now politics. This is where it gets problematic.

Quick, relevant background info: I have no contact with my mother. My parents split and I lived with her for 2 years, where she heavily manipulated me. I’m still in therapy. This is important, since it means that I now am hyper-aware of any manipulation in any degree.
That’s also why I am very fixated on being allowed to form my own opinion in politics.

Now, the issue:
My father and I where discussing how the country would plan on making transport greener; by making electric cars easier available or by making public transport more available.
I mentioned a politicians view, and he described why that was ironic and provided examples. To me, he formulated this as were it a fact. I was triggered by it, since I knew there were probably other opinions to this. 
I asked him which politician had this view, so I could research the opposite view. He didn’t know. I said I was interested in knowing, since I wanted to hear both sides, instead of having a one-sided debate with him, where I (a 16-year old, with no accumulated knowledge of the topic) tried to justify the other party in order to see both sides.

He called me naive and said that we should never discuss politics then, if he wasn’t allowed to express his opinion. I told him I just wanted him to explain this as less of a fact and let me form my own opinion.

My neighbour asked if they could use my washing machine for a few days till they get a new one and plug it into their outlet so it their use of electricity wouldn’t effect me. I still declined. My reasoning for declining was these arrangements tend to ask longer then a few days and I just moved out of my ex’s where I had to share with them and I absolutely hate having to time my washing. I did not disclose my reason to the neighbour simply because it’s none of their business.

My close friend and I made a bet together. She asked me what the condition of the bet should be if she lost and I said ""you sing for me"", then I asked what it should be if she won and she told me and I accepted it. 

Later the outcome of the bet was determined and she messages me saying ""I guess I will have to sing for you."" 

Immediately after that I noticed she was being flaky around the prospect of doing it with messages like ""Well it's better I don't sing"" and then later she said ""We didn't discuss about the time, So next birthday."" 

She's done this before and to be honest I felt frustrated that she'd made a bet and agreed to a losing condition that she was now backing out of. So I sent her a message saying: ""Remember last time I sang for you and then you said something similar. Like you said you would do it but never gave the time. So you owe me two songs now. ""

To this she simply responded twice with ""I don't remember."" 

At that point I said ""I'm sure you won't remember this one either. Next time don't make a bet if you can't accept the loss."" 

She simply responded with an ""Ok."" 

We talked a little about other stuff but I'm sure we both felt an undercurrent of emotion at what we'd just been talking about. 

Then last night she messaged me saying ""Did you feel disappointed in me?"" And followed up with ""Actually if you didn't say it 
Just say don't lie [her name]
I would have said  ok I owe you two songs 
I remember I was just teasting you
But it's fine   Don't make a bet then."" 

To the above two messages I responded ""It doesn't matter. If you are not comfortable doing something then I can't force you to do it."" And ""Bets are fine and fun. But you shouldn't agree to a losing condition if you have no intention of doing it. That makes the bet pointless and reduces the value of your promises."" 

I think this hurt her feelings and to be honest I was really hesitant at sending it out but I felt it was the truth and I wanted to share it. Finally, she responded with ""If you think of me in this way, Then I have nothing to say."" 

My eyes were hurting last night so I couldn't keep messaging. I told her I was confused by her response and that if she could tell me what she didn't like about what I said, we could discuss and try and reach a resolution.

I always clean up after them because their “schedules” don’t allow them to wash dishes and take out the trash, so I do it to prevent bugs. Believe me, in the past I’ve just let them do it on their own time, and we got bugs bad. Anyway this specific incident starts when my roommates in our group chat start freaking out because the office called and gave a “last warning” about leaving trash outside. No one in the apartment knows what they are talking about. So I go to my property manager (because I am now an employee at the office) and I apologise but i know we’ve been taking out the trash; I’m sure it’s other residents that are leaving them so please don’t fine us. She said yep “that’s well and good except that we opened it and find mail addressed to your roommates in it, so we know it belongs to your unit”. So I’m already frustrated because I look like an idiot in my new job to a boss who was already disgusted by all this and ready to slap a fine on our apartment. 

I’m just wanting to come home and make dinner okay? I spent my tiny lunch earlier in the day cleaning dishes and everything should be ready to go. I just want to relax and eat spaghettios. 

And then I come home to ROTTING FOOD IN THE SINK. Someone just decided to clean out the fridge. And instead of throwing it away. Put it all in the sink. And also used and dirtied and didn’t wash the pot I was gonna use for my dinner. They have been walking all over me. I literally do everything for them. Gnats are swarming around the sink and my anxiety kicks in. I texted all of them saying, I don’t know who did this, but no one should have to wash or take care of this for anyone else. The bugs are gross and the sink smells. In 2 hours I’m just going to throw the Tupperware away with whatever food is in it. If it’s yours please message back because without hearing anything I’m throwing it all away. 

I didn’t hear anything back. So I did. Bugs were everywhere. It was gross. Rotting fruit leaked from one of the containers. 

And then approximately 2 am one of the roommates texts me. She’s furious because those were her Tupperware and she thinks I over reacted. I offered to get her some new pieces after pay day next week, but then she started bashing me in the group text about how disrespectful I am. And I really am not sure that I am. I don’t think I’m 100% faultless, but I do think I had a right to be mad?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

About two hours in I happened to mention I was dating someone. I didn’t even get a chance to say it was an open relationship. He walked away from me like he never met me. He literally blanked me after making out with me heavily for two hours. He left me sitting there at the bar. His friends were like “nice to have met you” and I walked out. This just Happened.

by5m46	2019-06-08 07:48:12		AITA for giving my ex basically a bitch slap in the form of a text message after she found me on tinder?	"To make an incredibly long story short. 

I broke up with my girlfriend and decided to hop on tinder to meet new people. As I did so, I saw that my ex of 3 years swiped right on me. My ex decided to find a new dude and basically have a side, non sexual relationship (to the best of my knowledge) behind my back and I was so naive I didn’t know. I found out and immediately deleted her from my life. Anyway, I look at the match and there were tons of slutty ass pictures on there. Classic ex. I messaged her and said “what exactly are you doing?” 

After I said that it basically turned into a dumpster fire of her saying “we’ve only been apart for a month and you’re already on this app trying to fuck other whores.” Calling me a pig and saying I never loved her. This stuff was really jacking me off because it seemed funny how she was gonna say all this stuff to me, but LITERALLY USES THE APP TOO.  We go back and forth for a bit arguing, and then these two important things happened:

Her words to me (copy and pasted:)
“LOL. ur so Childish. I swiped right on you to make sure you knew what you were missing. I still do love you but I don’t know what to do anymore. You broke up with me so am I not allowed to miss what I used to have? I told u I’m sorry like how many times and all I get is you’re rude ass attitude like tf. I don’t even mess around with [RETARDED SIDE DUDE] so what’s the issue”

So my words to her exactly were (copy and pasted):
“You’re seriously insane? Reading that shit made no fucking sense whatsoever.. Yes, I DID love you, you broke my heart. Now I don’t fuck with you at all. You have no business telling me shit about being on this app, you’re on it too so eat your goddamn heart out and fuck more dudes lives up because you’re surprisingly good at it. What happened to [EXES SIDE DUDE]? Didn’t last long either? Or did you choose to once again make someone’s life miserable by hopping around other guys crotches while you play victim? Stay out of my life. You’re actually a pretty horrible person and it’s a shame I wasted 3 years on you. ”


I know it was incredibly harsh but I don’t really think I deserve to be played with like that. Girl or not, it’s fucking with peoples emotions and making them feel ways they shouldn’t and I don’t stand for it."		1	0
by5lt1	2019-06-08 07:46:50	Squirtinturds	AITA for being afraid of burning the house down in an earthquake?	"Backstory, I moved my boyfriend out to Southern California with me. He is well versed in blizzards, not earthquakes. 
We’re from an area of NY that gets blizzards all the time, so we both know how to prepare for that. 

However, I’ve lived in SoCal for about 5 years now, and recently moved him out here with me after I moved home for a bit. 
My problem is that Southern California has had ten earthquakes this week. I’ve dealt with earthquakes so bad I thought my town was getting bombed in the middle of the night, things fell off shelves, my glass closet doors ended up being offset... etc. 
He leaves his iron plugged in on the ironing board during the day, it’s automatic. It shuts off if left upright. If it falls over into its face, it will turn on and heat up. It’s on the ironing board which is also right next to our furnace and water heater. 
I asked him to unplug it when he leaves for work several times. He just says he’ll “try” I come home several hours after getting off my shift seeing the iron on. After he just simply said he would “try” I said I would buy a new iron. He got defensive and said he’s not perfect and neither am I, so what does it matter. At this point he’s yelling over it. 
My thought is, I would rather buckle down during an earthquake while we’re both at work and come home to our apartment than make it through an earthquake and then come home to a burned down apartment.

Naturally, the 4 year old is a bit more of a handful but generally speaking she behaves well for everyone but us (why do kids do this!? haha)

My mum will take our son every week, for 1-2 days to stay overnight. She never takes our daughter unless I beg (and even at that she will guilt trip me over it).

Today, we're supposed to be going out for a few hours (tattoo bookings) and my partner's mum was supposed to have our daughter (my mum still has our son since yesterday). Plans fell through as MIL's mum is very unwell and as she is her carer, she has to go be with her (not really suitable to take a child).

I asked my mum if she could come sit at mine for a few hours while we go for the tattoos, since she will have our son still anyway, but she refused like she always does.

She makes out like I'm the worst person for asking her, even though she offers to take our son all the time and rarely takes our daughter. I was only asking her to sit in my house for a few hours with her till we get back, not take her overnight as well.

I just really don't know what to do about her and how she plays favourite, but I'm left feeling like AITA because maybe this is normal? Do other grandparents do this? My MIL doesn't, so I'm so confused.

So now we have to take a 4 year old to a tattoo shop, where we don't think she'll be allowed on so instead we'll have to wander up and down the street with her whilst each other gets the tattoo.

EDIT: I spoke to her last night about this and she asked if my partner's younger brothers couldn't watch her for us (his brothers are in their early teens so not really appropriate either, especially as they will already have their younger sister to look after while MIL is busy with her mum). I spoke to her again after this post, to which she denied favouritism and said she just doesn't like taking her. I pointed out that with no reason other than not liking to take her, that's pretty much favouritism. She already knows how it makes my daughter feel as she has witnessed it first hand when she asks to go to hers and she says no but then takes my son (literally the same day, straight after saying no to her). She has now accepted that she doesn't give her granddaughter enough time compared to her grandson, so is going to sit with her this afternoon and then make more effort to take her in future. Whether or not she does... We'll see.

Thank you to everyone for replying, whether you thought ITA or not. It was good to see differing point of views, and this helped my discussion with her. I'll try to update again in future if she sticks to the promise of trying harder with my daughter."	Not the A-hole	0	0

by5is5	2019-06-08 07:32:56		AITA for asking my SO to come home from plans bc of anxiety issues?	So I’ll try to keep this brief. My  (21F) parents are both alcoholics and while they’re good people while not drinking and though I’ve never been physically abused or anything like that while they were under the influence, I’ve had some traumatic experiences surrounding alcohol. That being said it has taken me a long time to be at all okay with any kind of alcohol consumption around me (friends, SOs etc.) and I have drank only a few times myself and really just don’t like it. I have some pretty bad anxiety issues as well especially surrounding a lack of control (such as not knowing where a loved one is for even a short period of time). My SO knows this and rarely drinks but when he does go out with friends I find myself unable to sleep or calm down (as in having sometimes multiple panic attacks) until he returns home (usually anytime from 1-4am when he and his friends do go out). I know these feelings are my own fault and that they aren’t necessarily his problem and I always feel bad ruining his time by asking him to come home. AITA for wanting him to come home at a more reasonable time because of my own issues? I really don’t know here, because on the one hand I definitely feel like the a**hole because he shouldn’t have to change his plans to suit my issues but on the other hand, he knows this is a huge source of anxiety for me but chooses to stay out late at bars with friends anyway.		1	0
by5ihk	2019-06-08 07:31:42	throwaway523905395	AITA for getting upset w/ sister	"I’m 16 and my sister is 23. We have always been close.

Our relationship with our parents is strained. I resented them and my sister did too, but after she lived in a college dorm for a year (she returned this year), she was neutral toward them. My classes have gotten harder, and the tense home environment isn’t helping. I have self-harmed before. I admitted this to my sister a few months ago.

In any case, I had two papers due the next day. I was in a bad mood because I get mood swings, and I was stressed. As I'm working on my paper, I go into my sister’s room to ask for her opinion on something. As I’m leaving, she tells me about an email she sent to her professor. I get impatient with her and tell her that I don’t have time to talk about it. This upsets her. I told her I know I upset her, but I wanted to save the discussion for later because I had work. She said she could care less about what I was doing. This sets me off, and I run to my room and lock the door. For the next five minutes, she bangs on the door and screams at me to talk to her. I told her to stop and wait until we can discuss the issue calmly. She doesn’t listen, so I open the door.

She yells at me about how entitled I am and I wasn’t happy because of my negative mindset. She told me I was rude to her. I admit I was rude, but I do not think her reaction was fair. In the past, my sister lashed out at me many times when she was upset, and I never said anything. I told her that I was rude because I was stressed, and I didn’t mean anything by it. I tried to tell her I felt she didn’t value my feelings because of the way she reacted to my being impatient on one day even when she knows I have problems in my life. I tried to tell her this, but every time I explain my feelings to her, she either interrupts me or I get so flustered that I’m unable to convey my side of the story. I get upset, and she eventually leaves.

Two days later she comes into my room looking very defensive. She starts off by telling me I was in the wrong. I told her we should wait before having this conversation so we could cool down. She apologized for her previous reaction, but it didn’t feel like she felt bad about it. She barged into my room in a manner reminiscent of last time, and she interrupted me when I explained my feelings to her. Before the conversation started, she said it seemed like I wanted to end my relationship with her even though I never said that. It seems like she wants to end years of our relationship over this. I apologized to her about being rude, but I also told her she can't react this way every time I'm unpleasant. I lash out because I have issues, and sometimes they are unbearable. Is it healthy? No, but it’s also unhealthy for me to pretend to be happy to avoid conflict.

I think that both of us are at fault, but I feel because she's the adult, she should react more maturely when I’m not at my best. I don't want to lose my sister, but I don't know what to do."	Asshole	0	0

I told her that I was not sure if I wanted to be a dad and she assured me that she would be having an abortion as she can't afford the child and is not ready to be a mum. 
I accepted it and we both moved on. 

turns out that she decided to keep the baby and has been messaging me telling me telling me i need to step up and be a dad. I'm refusing to even listen to her and want to sign away any right to being a father.

by5h7c	2019-06-08 07:26:12	PissPotPatty	WIBTA If I decide to watch a show without someone that I was originally watching with someone first?	"To give some backstory, me (17) and my mom's (40 something) relationship is a lot more like a friendship than a mother/daughter authoritarian relationship, so, we do a lot of stuff together. One thing we do is watch shows together, usually we eat dinner and stuff while watching.

So, my brother recommendeded we watch Game of Thrones to get caught up, since there was a ton of hype about the final seasons and stuff. I was wanting to watch it, and never found time to do so, but my mom decided she wanted to watch it without me (she knew I wanted to watch it with her btw). Since we just finished Desperate Housewives, we've started watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. We love the show, but it's hard for us to watch it together, especially when my dad, who has no clue that we're watching it together, would flip out if he saw that I was watching it, let alone with my mom (he is overly protective about a lot of things he shouldn't be overprotective of).

TL;DR The reason I am thinking about watching it without her is because, well, she's watching a show I wanted to watch without me, and because I don't usually get time to watch it with her anyways."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

I had to go to my cousin's wedding yesterday. This is a desi wedding, so this wasn't the actual 'wedding' but one of the first pre-wedding parties (there are three more parties in the following week, including the baraat). It started at around 5-ish, and continued till around midnight, at which point I wanted to leave. However my aunts were of the opinion that I should stick around longer, because there was still some dancing and whatever to come, and since it was a Saturday the next day, it wasn't like I had to go to work or anything. 

The thing is, I am not a social person. I dislike crowds, I HATE weddings, I'd spent upwards of 6 hours with these people (I'm not close to my extended family, and I'm not comfortable in their presence), and I was going to be seeing them again all week. So I politely and firmly said goodbye and left. However, now some family members are mad because I didn't 'stick around for my cousin on her wedding day' (because in our weddings there is no 'bridal party' or 'groom's party', if you're a first cousin or a corresponding aunt/uncle, you're supposed to stick around even if you've got nothing better to do than to stand around in the corner), and now I feel bad.

We were talking about college and our undergraduate days,  and this guy kept talking very seriously about how he ""worked very hard"" and ""he's insanely smart"" and things like that. He's not just saying that stuff, he's also saying that in a very obnoxious way and randomly interrupting people (especially my girlfriend) to talk about his own 'awesomeness' and about his 'outstanding achievements in college'. 

Now to put things into context, my girlfriend is an electrical engineering major and I have a degree in Computer Science and a PhD in computational chemistry. He is an arts history major. I got annoyed and outright interrupted him to state (in a semi-joking manner) that ""the combined work that my gf and I put in during our first month of college was probably more demanding than the work he had to put in for the entire duration of his degree.""

He laughed it off nervously and was a lot quieter for the rest of the evening.

So going into uni. Since I was moving out my parents told me that there's a small ""room"" in a building my grandparenrs , aunt and other buyers live in. Everyone has his own flat. My grandparents are right infront of me. While my aunt lives in the flat that's right above me


Knowing my nosey family I decided that I do NOT want to live there. I want to be as independent as possible from everyone else and wanted to live my OWN life. I told my parents that I would not like to live there  

(Please note that I was the one paying rent so it's not like my parents were going to pay my rent if I lived there) 

My parents told me that I have to live for at least a year till I get to know the city and stuff. I agreed but on a few rules

1. I would only live there for 1 year
2. I am NOT going to answer the door for anyone that decides to visit at any time unless if we agreed that they could come no matter who they were. And that they'll have to tell everyone in the family about those 2 rules

Well 1 week in any my grandparents and aunt started the ringing part and for the first 4 times I've answered the door. The fifth time my aunt rang and I didn't answer. They knew I was in the room and I knew that they knew.

I wasn't doing anything wrong or anything important but I just felt like it was my right because it was a rule we agreed on. 

My aunt called my parents. My parents called me and started shouting at me about why I didn't answer the door. I told them that it was a rule we agreed on and hung up. 

3 weeks later. I pay my rent , my bills and move out without any notice to anyone in the family. After I moved out officially and found a room that'll fit my needs in a place that I actually want to be in. I informed my parents about it and shared the location.

Everyone in the family thinks I am a major asshole and some even cut ties with me. 


So AITA?


TL;DR. Didn't answer the door for my ringing aunt and moved out with out anyone knowing.

by5axp	2019-06-08 07:01:00		AITA for failing to “be happy” for my brother after he effortlessly got the job I’ve been dreaming about having since I was a little kid?	"Throwaway because, although I’m jealous, I don’t want to end up sabotaging him.

I’ve always loved movies, acting in particular; when I was a kid - it was the first and only job I ever wanted, I vividly remember, when I was 7, begging my Mum to sign me up for a weekend acting school.   

I’m from a small town and the only acting classes were in the next city - 20 miles away - and they were rich kid expensive. My Mum saved for a year and I got a place ...that’s where it all started. I went until I was 15; when I was 12, I got my first agent and had my first taste of the industry: tv shows, commercials, plays  - man, I remember being in my early teens, deciding that this was all I ever wanted and, at the time, it seemed like a pretty realistic goal - before my 17th birthday I had more credits than a lot of actors I know today. 

My next move was to try and get into drama school, which, at 19, I was got into one of the most prestigious ones in the UK. 

Fast forward three years, I graduate, get a good agent, and the future looks bright... well, it did. As many of you know, the acting industry is tough and, despite my previous experience and training, I struggled to get auditions and it ended up with me being dropped by my agent and having to move back into my parents house. It sucked.

The past 2 years ive been depressed and I confided in my brother. It was around this time he thought that he’d try his hand at acting, too. 

My brother has lived a charmed life; good looking, great job, valuable degree, and, despite his age, had enough to buy a flat . He’s never had an interest in acting but, because he was bored, I guess, he asked me to help him get into it. Which I did. Literally a week after he made the choice, without any prior training and no agent, he found an open audition for a Hollywood blockbuster looking for leads - I told him that it was probably a PR stunt but he auditioned anyway... and, after a series of screen tests, he got it. His first ever audition, his first ever acting experience, and he fucking got it.

2 weeks later, he’s flying out, signing contracts, meeting my idols, and now he’s suddenly filming this thing - I haven’t had time to think, it’s been such a whirlwind. 

Now my family are mad at me because I’m not “supporting him” or that don’t seem “happy for him” and, of course, I wanna be. He’s in a movie and I’m his fucking brother, I WANT to be proud and excited and all that but whenever I’m alone all I feel is immense jealousy. I’ve never felt this before, I feel like a clown, I’ve dedicated almost two decades of my life to this and he gets it all in a couple weeks - it doesn’t seem fair. And I get it, life isn’t fair, stop moping and get on with it... but how? I feel like such a fucking asshole. 

TL;DR been trying to become an actor for 17 years and, after never trying it before, in under a month, my bro booked himself one of the most desirable acting jobs in the world. I’m jealous and my family want me to get over it."	No A-holes here	1	0

"So for context, about a week ago I had made a meme that had gotten around 2K upvotes, and earlier today I saw my exact same meme reposted in r/memes, with nearly 10K upvotes

I could have just reported it to the mods and be done with it, but at the time I was pissed at this guy, and didn’t think about the consequences, so I took a screenshot of their post, including the account name, their post age, and how many upvotes it had. I then screenshoted my meme, with my post age and upvotes in it, and put them together for comparison. I added captions above the two screenshots, stating that they were reposting my content, and posted it to r/memes.

Immediately my post against them had gained traction, and a full brigade against this user was taking place on the subreddit, calling out the user for being a reposter. There were no threats against them, or at least I hope so.

I ended up getting permanently banned from r/memes for doing this, so I can no longer post, or comment on any post there.

She was too sick to work or even take care of our son so we needed someone during the day. We live with my mom who works during the day & I don't have any other family around so I asked friend to stay with us and help since she goes to school from home so it was a good fit. My fiancée & her are v close I thought it would be a surprise to help her mood. it wasn't.

I went to pick her up from her apartment after I got off work and I was waiting for her to come out. Fiancée asked if I got held up at work and I said yeah and I was omw. The friend got in my car just as the fiancée sent me a text saying ""you just did the one thing I didn't want you to do."" I thought she meant to send the message to someone else and didn't respond sense I was driving, but then a few minutes later she sent another text that said ""I don't want [friend] to be here by herself taking care of [son]."" My phone read messages via the stereo so the friend heard that one and neither of us new what to say. My friend looked a lil hurt/confused but I just told her not to worry about it and kept driving because we desperately needed help and there was no reason imo she couldn't watch our son. She been around a ton and my son loves her. He smiles & gurgles whenever he sees her. Tbh he's happier with her than w my fiancée and me lol tho that might just be because we have had squabbles lately so maybe we just aren't as chill.

When we got home I talked to fiancée. She didn't want Friend to take care of him alone because our son is the first diaper she ever changed and she doesn't have kids of her own. I told her that it would be fine and she said I was probably right.

The next day I worked from 8 AM-11 PM. My mom call me and asked if i knew that fiancée had called her mom and had her drive up and pick up fiancée and the baby leaving friend alone. I said no. My mom thougt that maybe she used this as an excuse to take the baby herself and never come back sense I was also considering breaking up and filing for sole custody as she had a child taken previously for neglect. She had cheated in the past but wants to stay together for our son and promised she wouldn't cheat. But friend never told me and only mentioned it when my mom asked where the baby was. She didn't know about our probs but she didn't even try to stop fiancée from leaving or anything. She said she thought I knew and now fiancée is pissed at her because she thought SHE told me. So now we had this huge fight started because our child's care taker elected to not tell me what was happenig & I think it would be best if i just cut her out. Friend is a nice person and she's helped us out a lot with our phone bill and food and so on but she jeopardized our son's wellbeing. She's tried to talk to me and fiancee but I havent responded cause she isn't taking responsibility."	Asshole	1	0

"Throwaway account because people involved know my Reddit and first actual ever post on Reddit (using mobile, too) so apologies in advance for any errors. This might be pretty long as well, sorry. 

I had dinner with my fiancé and his close friend after almost three years of putting it off. We finally got around to meeting up after so long because her boyfriend (? not sure if boyfriend because from what my fiancé told me, they've never been actually together but did all the boyfriend girlfriend stuff for years and she stayed by his side all throughout his sickness but also tried dating other guys during this whole thing). My fiancé felt that it was finally time to indulge her since she's been asking to meet up with me for the longest time. 

The close friend is someone I was uncomfortable with from the start since I just got the feeling that she was possessive of my fiancé. Some samples of this are: she messaged me a few times even before meeting me saying my SO has been in her life for so long even before me and that he'll always be important to her, just general stuff that always mentioned how special he is to her and how I'm just his current fancy. She even messaged me one time saying that he ""will always be her Person"". And she does this to every girl he dates, she would ask him to meet his new girl every time, and feels really hurt and guilt-trips him when he doesn't agree or doesn't make time for it. 

During dinner, it was nice to finally meet her, but I did feel a bit uncomfortable the whole time since she really emphasized the fact that she knew ""all of his bad sides"" and that she was a big part of his life since they were young etc. etc. She even mentioned that he would sleepover at her place when he was bored and that they would go out together all the time and all that stuff. She pointedly ignored me when I mentioned that I also went to school with him and that we were in the same elementary to highschool classes but just had different friend groups and only really got to know each other after university. And she went right back to talking about how she knew his whole family growing up and how close they always were even if they went to different schools. It just made me feel like we were competing for no reason at all. 

I told my fiancé afterwards that I felt uncomfy but he's upset with me and saying I'm just being too sensitive. AITA for getting uncomfortable and telling him about it? Should I just be understanding because she lost someone  important to her recently?"		1	0

by586t	2019-06-08 06:50:00		AITA for telling my GF giving all her attention to her crush is killing our relationship?	"TL;DR:  Dating long-term. Girlfriend gets new job, gives a lot of attention to  guy she works with. Neglects time with me, gets upset when I interrupt,  is hesitant to share. Makes me confused. Read the rest.

&#x200B;

My  girlfriend and I have been dating 5+ years now, since high school. She  comes from an abusive house where she wasn't allowed to date. When we  started dating she was socially immature. We've grown close over the  years, and I would sacrifice everything for her. She recently even moved  in with me on a moments notice due to some home life shit, and we've  been living together 6mo.

She recently got a job.

At  this job she's met a guy. A guy that she has expressed to me she feels  is attractive and strikes her in some way, and she doesn't know how to  deal with. She says he's like me, he makes her laugh and he's socially  awkward. They like similar things, similar games, and can relate. You  get the idea.

This  isn't abnormal. Everyone has had a relationship with outside interest  right?  Well, she's never had such an experience. I'm literally her  second boyfriend ever and her first boyfriend was in freshman year of  highschool for a month. I've been trying to tell her that feeling  attraction to someone outside the relationship is normal, what matters  is what action you take.

But  it's been different. She wanted to go out of her way to make him a  birthday gift, she spent hours one day just going back and forth with  ""is this too much? He likes this but I don't want to look weird"". It  makes me feel like his opinion of her matters so much. which is fine and  all, I can understand wanting to be liked by someone you admire. But it  got to the point to where it was exhausting. Hours on end, blocking our  time together with endless talk about this person \*\*who I don't even  know\*\*! And what's more she plays games with him for houuuuurs \*\*every  day\*\*, then complains when he's late to join the game. Like I even try  to play with her instead but she seems uninterested. It takes her a bit  to warm up to me...

And to be totally honest, I can't even remember the last time we were intimate :/ Neither of us have been in the mood.

\>  Look, I'm tired of hearing about this guy. I've never met him, I don't  know him. At first I was happy you found friends, we don't always have  the same interest so I'm glad you found someone to share it with. But  you've been obsessing over this guy. He's all you care about, day in and  day out all you are concerned with is what he thinks of you. Even when I  try to talk to you during your \*precious game time\* with him, you  respond to me annoyed as if I'm bothering you with my presence, as if  you don't want him to think about me even though he knows we live  together. I miss you, and I'm lonely, and I'm hurt.

So what do you think AITA? Was I too rough? Too clingy? Help me make this right."		1	0

by5714	2019-06-08 06:45:11	throwayayeet	WIBTA if I start to distance myself from my sister	"I (23F) am the oldest child of three siblings. I graduated recently and have been living at a close relative's during my entire college career. My youngest sibling (18F) is a recent graduate of high school that will be pursuing her major at a different school, but close enough to stay with me. We have not lived together for almost 5 years, but I am always there for her if she needs me. 

Recently I have been looking for new housing situation outside of close relatives, such as apartments with friends and stumbled upon a sweet luxury apartment deal for under market rates in a huge metropolitan area. I would be rooming with a guy (36M) who has a fiancee that doesn't live at this apartment. I discuss with my family and was met with ridiculous amounts of resistance. Only argument being that it is more economical to stay and save money.

I later discuss with my cousins that are around my age and they say that I should just move out and to enjoy being young while I still can before I settle down and have kids. My sister thought of this situation completely differently. She contacted my entire family and outed me as a raging alcoholic (I enjoy sipping high quality whiskey on Friday nights while reading a good book) and I was going to the apartment to get knocked up with this older gentleman. She points out examples of me getting piss drunk and vomiting on my bed as evidence that I cannot handle myself. Afterwards she says that she will take her own life if I were to move out as an ultimatum. After some texting, I decided not to move out.

Then comes last week, she met some guy (25M) through internet chat rooms 2 years ago and decided that he was going to visit her half a continent away. This shocked the entire family, since we did not know that this guy existed only to be notified right before he arrived at my parents home. He stayed for about two weeks and left. In those two weeks, I essentially took them out to eat, amusement parks, and entertainment. My family forced me to do this under the reason ""he came all this way"".

Before the boyfriend situation, I was sad that I might have not been a good enough older sibling, but now I am absolutely furious for what could have been a growing experience for me, only be smothered by my sister and entire family.

He initiated the relationship, but after few months broke up saying it is not going to work out. He was moving away and I said we can make it work but he refused. I was anyway moving to a nearby city. 

I wanted to go no contact since I can be very clingy.  He wants to remain friends with me though. I told him it is very difficult for me as I still have feelings for him.

He says that is okay but wants me as a friend.

Most of my friends from high school graduated from college this past month, so they’re back in town and some have invited me to catch up or attend graduation parties.  These are people that I’ve spoken to maybe three times over the past four years.  So while we were close a few years ago, we really aren’t now.  To be frank, high school was a very difficult time for me, I was overcome with anxiety and depression, and I would rather put that time way, way behind me.  The idea of seeing everyone from school has me kind of freaking out, so I was planning to tell my friends that I’m just too busy to see them (which is mostly true, I work a lot and I have to put in for a day off a few weeks in advance).  My family feels I’m a dick for not wanting to spend any time with them and that I’m pretty much obligated to see them.  They think I’m being a bit dramatic and I should just suck it up and see them.  I do miss them, but I feel like seeing them will kind of mess me up.  Is it wrong of me to not go to their graduation parties or catch up with them?	No A-holes here	1	0

So every night this week I have been woken up because the floor above me creaks every time someone walks on it. It’s pretty loud and you can hear every move the people above me make through my apartment. The apartment complex I live in is kind of old so I honestly don’t think the people above me are just stomping around being loud for the sake of being loud, but I still went and mentioned to the guy above me how loud it is sometimes and how it wakes me up. The guy just said “yeah we will try to be quieter” but nothing really has changed. I understand they pay rent just as I do and they should be able to do what they want in their home but it is not fair for me to get woken up every single night because of how loud it is. So am I the asshole for wanting them to walk around quietly because of the ceiling creaking loud whenever someone walks on it?	Asshole	0	0

It’s a step above beer league, and on the same step as college. It’s been a lot of fun so far, and I’m not looking to go pro or anything, it’s been more to get me out of the house.

Anyways, I needed to pay a fee to get in, get gear, help pay for away games, etc. There’s pretty much a full team (~50 guys), but only 20 or so guys show up to practice on a regular basis. I wanted to play defence, but was told that I’d play on the offensive line. Fine, as long as I start. We played one game, had about 40 people show, and we destroyed. It was good. Had a bye week, so we didn’t play.

Anyways, I get to practice Tuesday, and there’s talks about depth chart, great. Then there’s about 20 or so new guys. I get bumped from starting guard all the way to third string. I was told that if I don’t start on offence, that I’ll be on special teams. We get to listing special teams, and I’m on punt. That’s it. 

I go into practice starting a position, now I’ll see the field once. The worst part is that people who replaced me haven’t payed fees or showed up to practice, or anything. 

I’m trying to be positive and thinking that I can train to be the position I wanted, but I’m pissed that I show up, pay my dues and put in the work on the regular, only to be cast to the side.

by53bw	2019-06-08 06:29:42	Pinenouple	AITA for charging my housemates for cleaning	"Also a kind of rant

So , my house use to consist of my older sister (25), my friend from work (22F) and myself 24F). We had lived together pretty peacefully, not many issues , we kept to ourself and for the most part kept common areas clean. But in the last year my older sister had moved to japan for work, and my friend from work moved closer to the city for work at the hospital.

So now, my housemates are my younger sister (20) and my younger cousin (17-18F). And my house is in complete shambles compared to before. Since moving in (just over half a year), they both have collectively only done the dishes only twice. I have now imposed a “do your own dish/clean as you go” rule. No matter how many times I tell them to cleanup after themselves. 

They do stupid shit like if someone buys new toilet paper, they put it in the bathroom , but instead of taking the empty plastic bag of Toilet paper they just leave it on the floor in the toilet?! Or if they remove hair from the shower drain , instead of putting it in bin, they just place it just outside of the shower. I constantly have no cutlery because god knows where they are now.

I’m so over with their blatant disrespect for common areas, and I’ve told them so many times , I’m not their mother (they use to live with our mother), I’ve set up a cleaning chore roster. So once a week one of us cleans the house. If they do not , I charge them an unspecified amount of money (only because it was mostly an empty threat in hopes to get them to clean after themself)

But now I’ve “taken it too far” , and it’s “not that big of a deal , I should be cleaning anyway”

And I am, but I’m sick of the fact I’m the only one

Edit: at this point it’s not even about the money anymore , I feel like I have to bite their heads off every second day for stupid shit like leaving wads of foundation covered paper towels in the bathroom sink. Or using my Tupperware in place of plates and bowls because they cbf washing dishes . I’m afraid it makes me seem like a “aggressive” person to live with because I’m constantly snapping at them now."

We got along very well and I considered her my sister as I am an only child. Recently, she befriended a girl from her class who was known for her bad reputation. And slowly, my bestfriend became someone I hardly know. 

She was out late at night drinking and even almost got in trouble with the police for underage drinking. Despite best efforts, she wouldn’t listen to my advices and got angry when I hinted the fact that I called her new friend a bad influence. I am close to her mom and it sucks to see whenever she (best friend)  deceives her and lies every time she goes out. I know it’s her choice and I respected that. But things got messy when the school disciplinary head got involved and this resulted to her studies to spiral downward. 

Eventually, I found out that my best friend and her new friend were talking behind my back and called me names I wouldn’t imagine she would say. This has caused a great damage to our friendship and I’m hoping to retrack what I should’ve done and if I’m in the wrong."	Asshole	0	0

Me and friend 1 have been friends for 1.5+ years and friend 2 has been friends with him for twice as long and often get into heated arguments against each other which leads to them hating each other for 6+ months then deciding they’re cool. 

Me and friend 1 were playing a game online when I was about to go to sleep for the night. the next day, Friend 1 had blocked me on all social media sites with no explanation. I had later found out that Friend 1 was angry that I was being cruel and “walking all over him”. I had tried to apologize in some way and he didn’t want to hear anything. 1 month later, and I want to talk to Friend 2 again. (I didn’t talk to Friend 2 originally because of respecting friend 1’s values) We begin talking and have a good relationship for around 2 months. Out of the blue, he blocks me on all social media websites. When I try to inquire about this, he says,” you are a bad friend, don’t talk to me”. I didn’t get the chance to apologize or explain myself. 

The reason in depth why friend 1 blocked me was because I was making fun of him even though he did the same thing to me. The reason friend 2 blocked me was because I was also being to mean, to which he was just as mean back and did worse to other friends who stood by him just as I had.

I haven’t talked to either of them since, but from people who talk to both friends, they do the same thing I did and they take their anger out on other people."	Everyone Sucks	0	0
by51uc	2019-06-08 06:24:05	lioness0	WIBTA if I called out my FIL and told him honestly how he made his son feel.	"This past week the FIL came for a visit. He's been working out of the country for 4 years and this was only his second visit home. 4 month ago his first biological grandchild ( I have 3 kids to a previous marriage) was born and this was the first time in meeting the baby. He was home for a week and except for one day where he spent a full afternoon with us we only saw him for 2 hours every other day. The rest of his time he has spent with his large group of friends going out for dinner and to the theatre and spending their days cycling round the county.

When the visit was being planned it was made out that he would be coming over to spend some quality time with his son and getting to know his grandchild. The first thing that offended my SO was that he'd arranged to stay with friends rather than with us. It was quickly overlooked but after a few days of trying to arrange to go out for the day and making ourselves at his disposal it was quite obvious he would rather spend time with his friends keeping up with the ""friendship group politics"". 

Yesterday he came round to say goodbye before he leaves today. One of my older kids asked if he was staying for dinner only to be told once more he had plans with his friends as he had to keep up with the friends politics, a phrase we've heard a lot over the past week. My kid then came out with what about family politics? What if your son really wanted you to stay? 

Usually speaking so blunt to a grownup would land her in hot water but she was so right I just sat back and left him to find an answer, which he didn't have. My SO hasn't and wouldn't discuss that he felt let down in front of the kids so it was interesting to see that even the kids picked up on the fact he wasn't around much over the week. 

After the FIL left yesterday afternoon my SO broke down. After feeling estranged from his father for most of his life then rekindling a connection 3years before his dad went to work away he was really looking forward to spending some time with him and felt like he had been used as an excuse. One weeks holiday with his friends on the pretence of visiting his only son and new grandchild. 

I hate to see my SO so upset over things like this and it's kept me up all night pondering on if I should contact his dad and tell him how his son feels.

Story short, I had a fling with David and know I am TA for that part. But AITA for telling Mary afterward?

I met Mary in college 10 years ago, and I met her boyfriend later the same day. Her boyfriend was drop dead gorgeous, but I identified as straight at the time and sealed up those feelings pretty well. The three of us were close through college, and Mary and David graduated, married, and moved away.

Cut to 10 years later, and I'm single following a string of long term relationships with women that were not particularly fulfilling. I kept in touch with Mary, and she welcomed me as a guest while I was in town for a conference. While at their house, I mentioned in passing to David that I was questioning myself, and he showed interest. While alone, we cuddled but didn't go further. After I left, we both expressed regret for having not explored this further, and the next 4 months or so was a period of explicit online conversations, then I traveled back for a week to see him and follow through physically. After that trip, he grew distant and I moved on date other (non-married) men.

Over the next few months, Mary started volunteering relationship advice to me and anyone who would listen. Her intentions were good, but it was grating to think about: 1) her marriage is clearly not as perfect as she presents it, and 2) she shouldn't be offering me any friendly advice, given that I am the asshole who secretly slept with her husband. Finally, one day she was gushing about how she and her husband were physically ill whenever they were apart, and I wrote up an email to her saying David and I had premeditated sex a few months prior, and I have evidence (chatlogs) of the affair if she wants it. Mary and David immediately block me on all platforms, as would be expected.

Mutual friends weren't very surprised that the affair occurred, but some friends did consider me an asshole for telling Mary months later, particularly when I was doing it for my own closure moreso than hers. Still, it's good I told her, right?

BF gave this the green light. 

This week, my mom and I went ring shopping and we discussed the options at home. My dad overheard our conversation and asked in an annoyed tone: “If his budget is 14k, why the hell are you guys topping it up and getting sth fancier?” I explained that it’s a win-win - he doesn’t pay more than what he’s comfortable with and I share the burden to afford sth I truly like. My mom’s share is, well, a wedding gift, which is very kind of her. 

My dad wasn’t satisfied and grudgingly asked: “Why does he have to ‘buy’ you?” Patiently my mom and I explained it’s quite common practice now, that my BF’s older brother and sister both have engagement rings (bought entirely by the guys). Dad concluded the conversation with: “Does he feel insulted by what you’re doing?”, and it was very clear that it was an accusation, not a question. 

While my BF and I are both young, we’re both successful professionals and both have large amounts of savings. My BF’s share (14k) will put a small dent in his, and I feel that by offering to top up, I’m not implying “urgh, you’re too poor” but rather “it’s only fair that I also pay for part of my ring.” My mom agrees, but my dad thinks I’m spoiled and ungrateful. 

So, AITA?

Edit: I was hoping for fresh and insightful perspectives on the scenario I’ve laid out here, instead, I just got a lot of “HOW DARE YOU HAVE MONEY?!”, the charity chorus, and gatekeeping on how we should spend our money. That’s just sad, Reddit. People shouldn’t have to apologise for having successful careers and spending power. That’s my final word."	Not enough info	0	0

He sometimes goes a little too far, doing things like getting into peoples phones and posting borderline lewd stuff on their social media where relatives and co-workers can see.  Messing around too much and generally taking things too far.

Lately, I've caught him in lies a few times that he has denied.  Sometimes he blames shit on me, saying I did something that I clearly know he did.  But it's really just his word against mine, and nothing he does rises past off color pranks.  It's his way of avoiding blame, and is not like I actually get in trouble for it.  My wife realizes what's up.

Today, he lectured my son at a get together about telling the truth after a kid got hurt.  After we asked around with the others, we found out my son was telling the truth and his was lying.

Then it was time to leave.  Last time we all got together I lost my keys after I misplaced them.  It was a whole ordeal with all of us taking an hour to find them.  I accused my wife of misplacing them because she is always the one who misplaces things.  Her and I were frustrated because we had tired kids and wanted to go home.  Turns out it was definitely me who misplaced them, and I was the jerk that night by accusing my wife of losing them.

So tonight, I lose my phone.  After searching for 30 minutes, we find it tucked away in an inconvenient area of the house that neither I nor any of the kids were at all night.  He had been over there multiple times Because it was next to a basement bathroom.  This had his calling card all over it.  I'd put it at 99% sure he hid the phone to prank me because of last time.  He denied it.  This was it for me.  He had a history of these little pranks and lies and denials.

I called him out in front of everyone.  I got in his face and told him to stop being a hypocrite and if he's going to lecture kids about being honest, he should do it himself.   His wife strongly came to his defense and I got into it with her a bit too.  She's very much in denial that he pulls this shit, but I'm not the only one in this group that has said stuff about him not having a faithful relationship with the truth.

"We’re going to visit and stay with my sister in law in another state for 13 days on Sunday with our three month old baby. She’s a heavy marijuana user and vapes every night.

I realized it makes me pretty uncomfortable to think of vaping around and then holding and/or interacting with our babe while she’s high. I can also understand that it’s her own home and she can do whatever she wants.

by4vhu	2019-06-08 06:00:15		AITA for asking my roommate to move out?	"So I live in a major US city. I’m an artist and about 8 months ago I had plans to move into a 3 bedroom with two other guys from the arts community I’m heavily involved in. We all signed the lease but at the last minute roommate number three patched things up with his at the time ex-gf. Kind of a dick move but he agreed to pay rent until we found a roommate. 

He’s a close friend so we hastily found someone else to move into the room. I’m 27 and the other roommate is 28. I, perhaps stupidly, moved forward on letting a 21-year-old college grad take the room. He was out of state at the time and when I first moved to this city I struggled to find a room so I thought it would be a nice way to pay it forward. 

Cut to 6 months later this kid hasn’t found a job yet and spends the majority of his time playing video games in his room. We haven’t really clicked at all on a personal level. Meanwhile my other roommate and I are very busy pursuing various projects. 

It’s starting to really weigh on my mental health. I don’t get any alone time and I feel like this dude is just an intruder in my home.

He’s not a bad guy but with the age difference and the fact that he NEVER LEAVES THE HOUSE I want to ask him to move out.

He isn’t on the lease. I’d figure out a way to give him his deposit back before he would have to drop a deposit on another place.

I feel bad because our place is incredibly affordable for the city we live in by a factor of hundreds of dollars compared to other places. But at this stage in my life I don’t want to dread being in my own home. I’m rarely home right now and spend most nights at my girlfriends my other roommate does the same.

by4vdx	2019-06-08 05:59:54		AITA for not taking care of my mother's garden?	"BACKSTORY: I am relatively stable. I moved home to stay with my disabled mother and my sister who has stage 4 breast cancer. I was in medical school at the time when I decided to move home so it was a very difficult decision for me, in terms of my career.

Now: My sister has been fine, I've been helping out however I can. The problem recently has been my mother. 

A little background on my mother. She has had 3 kidney transplants. She has been sick more often in her life than she has been healthy. My own Aunt gave her a kidney (bless her). My point is that she has always been sickly. I have memories growing up of her telling me that she was going to die. One in particular she said "" \*my name\* would it be alright with you if I died?"" I was probably 8 or 9.

I have dealt with that in my own way. That's not what I'm addressing here. 

I got into a prominent medical school and finished my first year. Around that time my family went into a crisis. Basically my sister who is very young, got diagnosed with very aggressive, late stage breast cancer. My mother who has always been a sickly woman, began to decline as well. 

So I moved home and put medical school on hold.

It hasn't gotten any better. My sister has started to lose her mind, and I don't blame her. My mother's health has also continued to go down the toilet. I am just here stuck in the middle.

HERE IS MY DEFENSE: I am trying to carry on my life. I am trying to have a stable job. I am currently living with my parents to support them and help with appointments and grocery/medicine errands. My medical school will accept me back at any time because I explained the situation to them. 

SHE PLANTS A WHOLE FUCKING GARDEN. 

What?

I am trying to keep my disabled mother happy. But she does this with the help of her husband and acts like it is my responsibility to take care of it.

Every day she texts me ""did you water the flowers""

Every day I am thinking ""No I have real world responsibilities and other networking relationships to make""

I always answer ""I'll get to it tomorrow""

&#x200B;

My conflict:

She is legitimately dying. Flowers are one of the few things she enjoys. I honestly get annoyed that she is physically disabled yet plants flowers that she cannot take care of.

Basically, I was taking out the trash and left the side gate open by accident. Then as I’m dealing with the garbage bin my dog just speeds out of the house and down the street - and rolls herself into some awful other dog’s poop. She’s just having the time of her life rolling in dogsh*t and getting dirtier than a two-month old’s diaper. I lose it and run down the street where I grab her by the collar and forcefully pull her back home. When we get home, I slam the side gate and fuming, I yell at her. I scold her for rolling in poop and I push her down. She looks back up at me with those damn puppy dog eyes, but I see nothing but red. I chase her and in my fury try to get a hit on her. Fortunately I never actually hit her hard enough to bruise her but I really felt like I was going to. I pull out the hose and basically assault her with it. I chase her and try to spray her down. I chain her to the backyard tree by her lead, and I turn the hose nozzle to max and I spray her down. And then I give her a bath, but all the while being physically rough. She was scared to bits. Afterwards, I calmed down and apologised profusely to her. Gave her a few treats. She seemed to understand and let me pat her and everything. 

Everything’s okay nowadays. She’s much more well-behaved and is still a happy girl. I just still feel really bad about how I reacted and treated her.

by4u40	2019-06-08 05:55:05	sakura_honey	WIBTA if I asked my boyfriend to re-home his dog?	"I have worked with rescue dogs my entire adult life and have 3 dogs of my own. My boyfriend brought home a puppy in January. My boyfriend's puppy is about 9 months old, she's very cute and loves my boyfriend and I. She gets along very well with two of my dogs, however about a month ago she started picking on my third dog. 

A little background on my third dog: we think he's a border collie mix about two years old and I rescued him at about 7 months old. He had distemper as a stray puppy and has since been cured, but suffers from serious nerve damage because of it. He's a sweet boy and loves to snuggle and play, but he only has a few teeth and isn't coordinated like a dog his age should be. He's not in any pain.

My boyfriend's puppy spends a lot of time at my house while he's at work, because I have a large dog friendly yard and he lives in an apartment. He brought her over one morning and put her in the yard and she made a beeline for my third dog. She growled and rolled him over and stood over him. initially I just assumed she was getting older and trying to find her place in the pack, so I let it slide. However throughout the day she continued to have unprovoked incidents with him, so I decided to keep them separated.

The final straw for me was yesterday, he brought her over and she made another beeline for my third dog,but this time she picked him up by the neck and shook him. I struggled to pull her off of him and ended up getting bit in the scuffle. My dog ended up with punctures where she grabbed him.

My boyfriend has been defensive saying that I should re-home my dog, but I don't feel the same way. He's not interested in paying a behaviourist to work with his puppy, he believes it's somehow my third dogs fault, because she likes the other two just not him.

She said ok and left. A minute or so after, another employee approached my table and said, excuse me, I understand you have not made a purchase yet? I said ""no, I did, about twenty minutes ago I bought the food item and a small coffee. If you just ask, uh... "" I realized I didn't rememeber which person was at the register when I bought it.

I went up to the counter to ask for my receipt. They asked how much it costed and I said 9 something.

Today's story is about how I missed my friends birthday on purpose because of the stuff he does. To begin he sends out a group text where he tell me that he wants a group a friend's to this gold place that is technically a bar, but the fact that theirs golf means I can just stay away from that, but from what I hear, it's actually a really cool place to hangout if your in college (probably because all the d-bags are down in the SouthSide of town). In the text I saw that he said he was going around 10,which I assumed was 10pm, but if my dumbass had actually read the message, he said he wanted to meet at 10 am, then spend the rest of the day going around town and eventually go to a bar/nightclub for his birthday. I told him that I had to help clean up for a grad party that was being held at an event hall which was 45 minutes away( I intern their as an event planner and marketer. My mentor is a reporter and anchor for the local news stations so this gig I have going is basically the stepping stones to my career). I told him that I don't if I could go anymore, which he begins to complain that I should come because ""it will be fun"" even though before I have told him I hate the bar scene in the city we live by because a. The general crowd that goes down their are just trashy, not everyone mind you, but mostly that's the crowd that goes down there and 2. Because the bars in town are just so damn small, like the fire marshal has to go downtown every weekend to make sure people can get out small. So I tell him that I'll see about it and we call it a day. So come tomorrow, all day I had spent picking up stuff like honey extractors, Tables, barrels of honey, and chair  all while cleaning the place before 3. We finally get done at set time and I am pooped at this point and just don't feel like doing anything. Then I hear phone go off with a text that reads ""Casino now, dinner at 6:30"". To which I reply ""____ I just got off work"" then he says ""ok so come"" now what I said back might come off as rude, but please understand, I was tired, I had long drive home and I had just got a full tank of gas, so I reply with ""Oh yeah let me come down all sweaty from lifting equipment out of the building"" he just text back ""ok"", but I have a gut feeling that he was talking shit on me to the other two buddies he had with him. So as I'm scrolling through my Snapchat, I see him at the bars, again and I told my folks that I dodged a bullet because I know that he was gonna drag me down their again and was wondering why the hell he keeps trying to get me to go places I hate? However they said, I should be happy that he's trying to have fun with me so my question here is, Am I an asshole for skipping his birthday even though I know I would have been miserable if went with him."		1	0

by4jb7	2019-06-08 05:21:43	Jmcb23	AITA for dating a girl in high school, full knowing I was gay at the time, then standing back and watching as she destroyed the majority of her friendships after breaking up?	"We dated for about 6 months in our second last year of high school. At the time I never intended on dating her, but between crippling self-esteem issues, ongoing peer pressure and not wanting to hurt her feelings, it just happened. As the relationship was short-lived and problematic, it never really made it past the point of being a good friendship with another name. 

Anyway upon breaking up, things were a little rough for a while, but they soon worked themselves back out. We decided to keep it civil and try to remain friends for the sake of everyone else, as we hung out with the same group of people. This worked out relatively well, and we managed to go through our final year of school without any major issues, and the friendship even continued well into the year after. 

About 6-9 months after graduating, things started taking a turn for the worst, where she started treating me differently to the rest of our other friends. If the group was going out to dinner to a restaurant she didn't like, she'd tag along and talk to me like shit the entire time, taking out her frustrations on myself and myself alone. Someone would invite one of our other friends she didn't particularly like to an event we had happening, and she'd take it out on me and give me attitude the entire time. Just similar petty things that were usually out of my control, but I'd cop the brunt of her attitude. 

What broke me was when I planned to go camping for my birthday, whereas she wanted me to take everyone clubbing instead. She went behind my back to convince everyone to go clubbing, even laughing at the idea of me showing up at the campsite alone. Sure enough my friends weren't assholes and they all came camping, including her since she had nobody to go out with. She was in a filthy mood the entire weekend. Constantly complaining, saying how shit of a time she was having, and that she'd rather have gone clubbing. I ended up snapping, telling her if she hated it so much, then to go home. Sure enough she went back to the tent, grabbed her things, and left. 

Things only escalated further once I got home. The reason she'd been acting that way is because she wasn't satisfied with the friendship, and the entire time she'd been wanting something more. Ever since we broke up in high school, she'd been holding on because she wanted it to progress back into a relationship. With tensions running high, I told her I couldn't be friends anymore, but I'd remain civil for the sake of everyone else. 

Over the coming month, she went out of her way to try to organise things with the rest of the group behind my back, essentially trying to isolate me. Again, the rest of our friends could see this happening, so they called her out on it. During that time, one by one, she fought with the remainder of her friends, slowly pushing them away. 

Over the past 7 years since, she still glares at me and my friends whenever she sees us in public."	Everyone Sucks	0	0

For some background, it was on a school night in the middle of the week and we had a huge exam the next day. I had skipped school that day to study and because there was nothing else going on in class. I had a prior commitment that lasted about 30 minutes but it was in the middle of the evening. 

She went to school and we texted a bit after. We wanted to hang out and I told her that I had small plans but I really wanted to see her before and after. She acted like it was fine and I tried to talk about something else to lighten the mood. 

A couple minutes go by and she hits me with a huge paragraph. She talks about how on my birthday (2 months prior) she had begged to not go on a family trip so she could spend time with me. But, my birthday was also on spring break and a weekend. She originally had other mandatory plans for that day and was skipping her family trip because of that (I was genuinely fine with just hanging out the day after) but then those plans ended up being cancelled and still had to convince her parents to let her stay home. 

I totally saw her point of view where she was talking about how it seemed like I didn’t care. I apologized a bunch and tried my hardest to sound sincere over text. She’s my best friend and I hate the thought that I did her wrong like that. She blew off my apology with a “whatever i don’t care.”

by4fkq	2019-06-08 05:14:24	Walking_Catastrophe	AITA for cutting ties with my mom?	"tldr at the bottom. 

I know this doesnt cover nearly enough detail to give a super insightful opinion, but I hope it covers the gist of it.

I was never physically abused, nor would I say I was mentally abused either. But my mom kind of did the bare minimum, kept me clothed and fed etc. She is also a heavy drinker, and, in my opinion, suffers from some kind of mental illness, be it depression or what have you. In which she refuses to admit. 
When I moved out with my GF (now wife) we started drifting. I was about 20, I'm now 30.
3 years ago I had my first child, that's kind of when it all started...and it started with Facebook. I didn't care either way but my wife preferred noone share any pictures of our baby, I respect my wifes wishes so I tell my mom this, my mom likes attention so she wasnt thrilled. About a month later what does she do but set a picture of my daughter as her profile picture, claims it was an accident. Wife and I are upset at the disregard to our wishes, ask her to remove it, no response. I log into her account, take it down (I knew her password from when I set it up) . She gets VERY upset that I ""hacked"" her.
Eventually we get over this hump but the wheels are wobbly.
Not long after, she starts getting upset, saying we're deprioritizing / disrespecting her, mad that she doesnt see her grandchild enough (at that point its basically every Sunday), and that she has to ""schedule an appointment"" to come over. Well, you can't just stop by whenever you feel like it, it has to be a good time for us and our child right?
We went through periods of not talking then talking, on and off for a year, each leave of absence increasing in severity. Basically always the same quams. She was upset we don't ask her to babysit (would you let you alcoholic mother with depression babysit your child?). And that we never go to her house (place is disgusting, litterbox in the kitchen...enough said).
My wife and I never fight, but when we do, it's about my mom. I try to see the good in everyone but sometimes it's hard.
The last time she saw her granddaughter was her first birthday. Ever since then it's been failed rekindlements, half assed attempts at reaching out (text msg that just says ""I hate this""). Always the same behavior.
So recently I've decided to officially cut ties with her. But I always feel guilty, I'd really like honest opinions about it.

TLDR; mom is very irrational, became unbearable once my daughter was born. Stopped communicating with her."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Ok, so round two... just when I thought this was all over with.

In exchange for getting out 1 month early on the lease (even though this had been agreed upon at another time) I ended up forfeiting a half month's rent. I really just wanted out and recognized my commitment to the end of the month and that I valued being stress free two weeks earlier a lot at this busy time of life. So I moved out on May 11 but paid utilities until the 15th, and forfeit over 2 weeks of rent. My landlord got back into the property on that day (the 11th).

They kept $150 of the damage deposit for some scratching on a door they felt went beyond normal wear and tear and I let them have it because honestly I just wanted out and was so tired of fighting with them. I felt they should have just taken it from the $800 (half month's rent) and extra utilities (about $40) I'd be paying for the extra 4-5 days, but didn't want to open a can of worms.

Anyway... At the move out they asked if I knew where the microwave racks were that had been there 5 years ago when I moved in. I said I wasn't sure and if I found them I'd be in touch to drop them off. We left, signed forms, that was it. Or so I thought...

We unpacked and never found the racks. No big deal right. I told them this when they asked. Now weeks later they are STILL texting me about it. Maybe they were accidentally thrown out or something or lost? I have no idea. Quite honestly I no longer care. But this was 4 weeks ago and they are STILL contacting me about these damn microwave racks every couple days and treating me as if I'm still their tenant telling me this is ""unacceptable"" etc. Today I couldn't take it any more and just blocked them. I have had enough and I have a kid and two jobs to deal with I don't have time for these stupid microwave racks from a bygone business transaction.

I feel that I already got screwed by giving them a half month's rent worth $800, letting them keep $150 over something a can of paint would have fixed, and paying 4 days of utilities and leaving over two weeks early when we had the technical right to stay till the 31st. What more can they possibly want from me over these stupid racks?If it was so important I feel they should have delayed the signing of the forms until they were found or compensated for (at which point I would have likely become furious about the already insane amount of money I was losing) and I honestly feel it's harassment at this point.

Where does it end? I thought everything was done and clear when the deposit was returned and forms signed. AITA for blocking them and wanting to move on?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

21, M, recently diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, I moved in with my aunt and I just found another job and have been either at work, or in my room on my phone/ computer or sleeping. 

My relationship with my mom is strained. She raised me as a single mom without a steady income and to the best of her ability, while struggling herself with mental health.
I had to deal with the brunt end of those mental health issues, like getting name called “a son of a bitch”, “bastard”,  “pig” when my room wasn’t clean, etc. She had locked me out of the house multiple times, forcing me to sleep outside.

The recent issue from her has come about from me being in debt from failing school and missing payments of my rent. She’s currently out of a job again, and can’t make her car insurance company, along with the potential for debt from me. This resulted in making her from what I see hate me. She had come down to visit, and ultimately ended with her pounding at my door at 8 in the morning to angrily yell at me about “what was I doing with my life” until I was in tears and had to run upstairs, when we had already agreed to go get me counseling the night before. She would look at me with what I can only describe as anger during her visit. She even said she was afraid for her life, that I would murder her, when I got angry and shouted for her to leave me alone. That was about 2 months ago, and has made me not enjoy being around my mom or talking to her, even though she says she’s sorry.

She had just come to visit again today to talk. I talked about how I didn’t think I could stand being around her who didn’t know me well enough that she would think I would end up killing her, and ended saying I didn’t want to be poor and forever dealing with mental issues for the rest of my life. I left the room after that and my aunt had me come down to have a talk about why my mom was in tears.

They both confronted me about being in my room too long on my computer rotting my brain, being uncompassionate person for not keeping up around the house and holding onto the past, and for hurting my mom’s feelings.
I responded that they both hold onto issues and hurt each others feelings often too, two times not taking for years.
I then brought up how they both smoke pot and watch tv in their free time. My aunt then got in my face and said she wasn’t going to take that from me when she works 2 jobs, that I didn’t keep up with basic house work, and that I could just get another job but “you don’t because that’d take time away from your computer”. It devolved from there.

I do struggle to even shower or leave the room I’m in, but I feel like my mind is being fucked not knowing if I’m truly just the bad person I’m told I’m not in therapy but told I am by family. At this rate I might get kicked out of my aunts and become homeless. (Going back to my mom’s is not an option, for my mental health’s sake)

My brother (28) just got back from deployment. For several years he has done his best to keep his distance from our family and not talked to any of us. 

Two days ago he turns up on my doorstep with his bags. Our mother passed a few years ago, my father a year before that, and no one heard from him during any of that. 

So he’s on my doorstep being happy and pretending he is just stopping in. Talking as if it hadn’t been nearly a decade. 
Then he tells me the place he was going to stay at fell through and he has no where to go. 

Now.. I live in a two bedroom apartment. With my husband and two 5 year olds. We don’t have enough room for another person - let alone someone I don’t even really know anymore. 

I ask him if he needs money for a cab, or for me to check with some friends of mine to see if they can take on a renter. 
At the mention of him paying rent he loses his shit. He starts raising his voice and tensing his arms. My husband  stood up defensively (understandably in my opinion). At which point my brother started to look like he was about to start a fight. 
My husband used to be a police officer and he warned my brother to calm down or get out. 
After some yelling and some firm intimidation from my husband, my brother left, slamming the door on his way out, yelling about how I’ve never been a good sister. 

So here I am. I feel bad. But I feel stupid for feeling bad. Like. He verbally assaulted my husband and I, in my house, with my kids in the next room, after we offered to help. 
But a part of me is saying... he might have been in combat. He might not be seeing things right. I don’t know what he has gone through in the military in the last 8 or so years. 

TL;DR 
My estranged brother got back from deployment and wanted a place to stay. We haven’t got the space but I offered to help find him somewhere. He got very angry and we kicked him out immediately. Now he likely doesn’t have anywhere to go at all. I feel bad.

So literally you could be driving and next to you is a 13yo kid in a jeep renegade.


moving on, couple years back my father (may he rest in peace) taught my younger brother and I how to drive automatic transmission car and his lessons were amazing to the last bit, I learned how to drive in crowded areas, highways, rain, etc. I was really confident with how I handled the car.  

 Fast forwarding to approximately august 2018,( I am 19 yo have obtained my license and everything is fine) my mom and I were in the car and I am the one driving, on our way back home there was that intersection in a side street ( I guess that's the right word), to even simplify it more imagine I was driving on a straight road and the intersection is placed upahead about 400meters where cars come from your right to the left, so when I was about 100 meters or even less from that intersection I kept really low steady speed to check for cars ( just a quick note here, cars were actually parked where it SHOULDN'T  be parked so u could actually SEE THE FREAKING cars coming from that intersection plus there was no any type of speed bumps placed to further proof this area from accidents)
And here I am went ahead and moving forward and then BOOOOOM high speed asshole came crashing in my front right door, summarising what happened after that: the guy who hit me knew he was the one to blame and he didnt even argue about it, but the problem is from since I dont wanna drive anymore not because I am afraid but because this is my parents' car and we kinda middle class sort of thing so I dont wanna push my mom to fix anything because I hit the car or something even if it is not my fault because redditors let me tell you the look on my mom's eye when the accident happened it was like shocking or like she lost something precise and we cant afford new car so I went to my room that night and blamed myself for what happened and I promised to myself to never touch the car again but my mom keeps telling me I have to take the car to help her going places or maybe driving my brother to school instead of her and she actually knows it is not my fault the car was hit that day but I kinda feel she doesnt get the struggle inside me, I just dont want her to experience such devastating accident or to pay a large bill.

Does lyft and uber on and off. Smokes weed all the time but he never has money. Doesn't have a high school diploma, and despite numerous attempts from my sisters and I, he is still doing nothing with his life. 

I live in a small one bedroom apartment with 2 kids which means I barely have space to breathe sometimes. A while back, my brother got kicked out of his girlfriend's place and needed somewhere to stay. I didn't want to let him stay because he owes me money that he never bothered to give back, and because he never helps with buying food or paying part of any bills. But family is family right? He would work for 3 hours max and then call it a day. Sat around taking my space and using my tv all the time. Again, not helping buy groceries even though he ate my food. Not giving at least $10 for the light bill even though he'd turn on my ac when I wasn't home, without my permission. 

Then my mom needed somewhere to stay and all of a sudden I was so cramped up in my own apartment. I absolutely hated being here. Eventually my brother left because he got back with his girlfriend and I was left with my mom. My mom recently got married and finally left my apartment and I couldn't be any happier. My mom sent him money for gas so he can come down for the wedding but he didn't show up. That pissed me off and I stopped talking to him for a few weeks. 

So now he needs somewhere to stay again and I told him no. I also told my mom some time ago that I was done doing favors for him. I can't sit around and help him when he doesn't even want to help himself. She's pissed at me now because he's my brother and I have to help him. According to her I have to take him in because he's family. Am I wrong for not wanting to baby him anymore? I told her we're only teaching him to rely on us instead of teaching him to get his shit together. He's a man now and I'm so done with his bs."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I drove two hours to spend the weekend with my boyfriend. I had some things I needed to pick up from the hardware store in the town he lives in, so we decided to meet there before going back to his place. I arrived about 20 minutes before he did, and decided to get a head start on my shopping. Just minutes after I start shopping I start getting a migraine and severe stomach cramps. My period had arrived more than a week early, and it always causes horrible symptoms (severe cramps, vomiting, hot flashes, migraines, etc.). I text my BF and instead of shopping he just drives me back to his place.

Once back at his place I take some ibuprofen and a bath before crawling into his bed to try and sleep the pain off. Once I wake up I find my boyfriend playing Xbox with some buddies online, and I head of to the bathroom to take care of myself. I'd been in the bathroom for less than 30 seconds before my BF knocks aggressively on the door demanding to come in. I follow him into the bedroom where he points to a golf ball sized blood stain on his sheets. I apologise and offer to take the sheets down to the apartment laundry room to have them washed. Instead he hands me a bottle of hydrogen peroxide and a cleaning rag and tells me to hand wash them. I tell him I would much rather just pay the $2.00 to wash them downstairs, since I'm still not feeling well. He pulls the sheets off and tells me that I can hand wash them or I can leave. In which case I chose the latter and got an Uber back to my car at the hardware store to spend the rest of the weekend at my parents place instead. 

AITA for not wanting to hand wash the sheets?

EDIT: When I was shown the blood stain it looked pretty fresh, still bright red, and didn't look like it had  started to dry yet.

"For some background, my mom and I used to be really close, I loved her a lot but she was also very critical of how I was as a person.  My mom was a preachers daughter and really hammered religion into my brother and I since we were born.  For some reason though I just never became the Uber religious person my family members were.

I ended up marrying my husband six months after we met, which is ironically how long my parents waited to get married. My parents always expressed how they felt that my husband was taking me away from them and that he was never letting me see them, etc. My mom was the ring leader of the accusations, never making an attempt to visit us after we moved out, despite only living thirty minutes away. She wanted us to visit every other day, my husband and I are homebodies and only visit people when we feel it’s been too long, or when someone invites us over a few days in advance.

For three years I haven’t gone to church, I stopped going with them to church because the members there were accusing my husband and I of getting married because I was pregnant and that I needed to repent (I wasn’t pregnant nor am I now.) 

My mom and I had been no contact during these three years despite my several attempts to contact her through text and fb.

A few days ago, I got a message from her saying “you’re living in sin, I’m worried about you and I cry every night thinking about how out of touch you are with God.”  My husband saw it and was livid with her, saying that he was going to give her a piece of his mind, and saying that she was a horrible mother because she had been ignoring me the entire time. I agree with him because she only texts when she finds it convenient for her.  

I didn’t respond to her and deleted my Facebook because I didn’t know what else to do, I didn’t know what to say and still don’t. But it’s been bothering me a lot, and I feel like I’m being over dramatic about the situation despite my husband telling me I have nothing to feel bad about. He’s explained how her using religion to guilt trip me is not the way a relationship between family should be.

My husband and I don't plan to tell our baby about Santa/the Tooth Fairy/Easter Bunny. When he asks about them, we will tell him the truth (that Santa/the Tooth Fairy/Easter Bunny is a fun pretend game that some adults play with kids, but that there is no such thing). We will ask him if he wants to play that game with us, but be clear there is no Santa/Tooth Fairy/Easter Bunny. 

When I shared my plan with some of my friends, they stated it was a mean thing to do and that I'd be an asshole to tell my child the truth. Their reasoning was first that my son would enjoy believing and second that my son will tell other kids and ruin it for others. I plan to discourage him from the latter, but kids being kids, they may be right that he will. My brother told me the truth about Santa and I don't feel scarred for life though. 

It boils down to, I don't want to lie to my kid, even about harmless stuff (we will keep things age-appropriate about topics such as sex/violence, but will always avoid lying). We are atheists as well and see this as a way to talk about belief early. My kid is way to little for this to matter for a while, but I am curious what others think."	Not the A-hole	0	0

I'm pissed but try to respond bluntly but respectfully, and he asks (rudely and trying to guilt me) if I want to remain friends or not. I tell him no, and say that maybe one day we can be friends again but I just can't be around him anymore.

From the way the guy types it looks like he’s a kid, so already I’m a little uneasy in addition to the fact what he’s asking is not exactly the most adult kind of thing to request (but I just assumed he was just into it, there’s a lot of weird stuff people like way worse than that). I check his profile while looking for the right Spartan model to download when I notice he both has a YouTube channel, and made some of his own stuff. 

I notice someone asked if he’s eighteen and he claims he is, but someone else challenges that statement by citing him claiming the YT channel was his as a point against that. So I check the channel out, and the content is clearly that of a kids. We’re talking crap production quality, no commentary, and it’s exclusively mobile games like PUBG and Fortnite. When confronted with that, he claimed the channel was his brothers, but later contradicts himself when I press him on it in the dm. I also noticed he changed with birthday immediately after I accused him of being underage, but he says a friend broke into his phone and changed it without him knowing. When asked about his grammar, he says he’s Asian and that he’s not good at English, and even sends me a picture of a young Asian man and claims to be him. I still rejected his request, because it didn’t feel right to me. Am I in the wrong to do so?

TLDR: Guy asks me to make sfm porn for him, I say no after checking his twitter and YouTube channel, he insists a friend hacked him and his childish grammar is because he’s Asian, and I don’t buy it after he lied about the channel being his.

Edit: He just told me he’s 15. Ladies and Gentlemen, we got ‘em."	Not the A-hole	0	0

Just stayed at a hotel, I'm kinda germaphobic so I threw all the sheets, except the bottom one covering the mattress, off the bed and got out my good 'ol red blanket (which was good, there were a lot of yellow stains). 

Smelled something kinda weird when I went to sleep, almost like wet dog, smelled the pillows and they smelled fresh, figured I was imagining it and went to sleep. Woke up and my red blanked was covered in white dog hair. I was disgusted, but staying with people in the next room over, and didn't want to make a big deal out of it. Now, I do want to make a deal out of it. That's gross, they obviously only washed the pillows, and NONE of the sheets. Who knows what else nasty was there?!

I'm not thinking of anything super bad, just like, ""I stayed at the hotel (insert story) and obviously I feel absolutely disgusting. This is unprofessional and unacceptable.

Idk, I doubt anything would even happen, and I don't want to ruin some clerk's day. On the other hand, it's seriously unacceptable, and if it could lead to something, I really feel that I need to do something about it, but I don't just want to send something rude to some poor person who can't escalate it to the person above them, and there's no need to waste time if nothing will come of it. I'm not looking for a free stay or anything (obviously, ew). WIBTA?"	Not the A-hole	0	0

They like each other now, but at the time, it caused a massive rift between gf and that side of my family. Cousin and GF both admitted they were wrong.  Whole family (bro/sis/aunt/cousin) wanted us to split but we all agreed to start fresh when I told them we were expecting our 1yo. Everyone did but sis whos been passive aggressive to my gf ever since. Shes started fights between us, tries to get me to dump my gf. I told gf to deal with it so it wouldnt become a new fight. Gf got angrier over time, didnt feel like she could talk to me.  Things got worse when son was born and sis didnt respect her as the mother of my child. Didnt listen to what gf said about son and still tries to break us up. Gf tried to mend things with her a few times but sis never stopped and gf stopped wanting to when sis began disrespecting her as a mom. Gf vented to a random fb group and my sis happened to see. Gf admits fb was a bad place to vent but also says she wouldnt have had to vent if I put a stop to things to start. Sis sent screenshots. I heard a lot of the comments gf mentioned and sis did say them. Sis said gf was lying to manipulate me and wasnt allowed in her house anymore, demanded I split with her. I gently said that I heard her say some of them but said I'm sure she didnt mean them how gf took. I know she did but wanted to diffuse things. Sis said I wasn't defending her. I got angry because I clearly was. When I didn't back down, she texted gf about every complaint I made about gf to her, plus some fake things. I had said the true things to gf too so she wasn't mad at the comments, but was mad  I said them to sis after she told me not to discuss her with my sis because she knew sis would try to use it against her or cause problems. Sis insulted me to gf and said I was a shitty person who didnt care about my family and said I could go and live my shitty life. Gf defended me and that made sis angrier. We didnt speak for a while, but family is having a party for my other cousin(f) for her divorce. Sis is here. I wasn't planning on talking to her, but she apologized to me and we're drinking and having a good time. I told gf that sis and I are great now and we're bonding. Gf asked if she apologized. i said yes. Gf asked if sis was still going to attack her. I said who knows. I just want to enjoy time with sis but gf is pissed. she feels like I'm throwing her under the bus, not acting like a team, I'm just letting sis bully her so I dont have to stand up to sis. But this is my sister and I dont want to fight with her. If I bring it up, she'll probably get mad and she and I might stop talking all over again. I dont think gf should put me in that position.

AITA for not asking her to apologize to my gf or for not bringing up the attacks and asking her to stop from now on?      

Update: Other members of the family gave me hard drugs when I was drunk. Told me to lie to gf. I didnt and realized how fucked up they are. Cutting off that entire side of my family. Not going to the pool party or anything else ever again. Gf took video of me admitting to the drug use with my consent and we agreed if I ever do it again or speak to that side of my family, shes showing the police and I'm never allowed near our son again. Im sleeping in the extra hotel bed and not allowed to touch my son. I am the asshole."	Asshole	0	0

by3zkb	2019-06-08 04:22:17		AITA for not giving my seat to a pregnant woman?	"Please hear me out before you crucify me.

I work 2 jobs (that I work back to back) and go to school on my days off. I frequently have to take 2 trains and a bus to get home. Sometimes I can only get 4 hours of sleep. I was exhausted and praying for a seat on the bus last night. Not exaggerating, I was feeling a bit dizzy. I sat in the middle of the bus (not the disabled/elderly section where you must give up your seat if requested). Bus started to get crowded and all the seats were taken. A pregnant woman got on and made her way next to me. She politely asked if she can have my seat. I said ""I'm sorry but I'm not feeling well"". She said it's ok. There was a tall man standing near her and loudly told me ""You can't be serious. You don't see that she's pregnant?"". The woman tried to tell him that it's alright but he just persisted ""You gettin' up young blood or what?"". A few people pulled out their phones to record me. So I didn't argue with him, I got up and got off the bus. Somebody shouted ""yeah GTFO!"" behind my back. It wasn't even my stop. I walked the remaining mile or so, home. I don't know why people assumed I was just being a dick. I usually always get up for a pregnant woman. I see some of the same faces every time I take that bus and now I'm gonna be hated on for no reason."	Not the A-hole	1	0
by3xfa	2019-06-08 04:15:39	Grim-Cat	AITA for wanting to end a friendship of 8 years because she is close friends with my abuser	"El= Used to be close friends
Me= Me (duh)
Iz= Ex-best friend/abuser

So I met El and Iz when we were in the first grade. We all became fast friends add you often do when your young,  but me and El were always especially close. After my best friend Lexi left when we started fourth grade I only had El and Iz. 

Iz never really wanted me to talk to other people or make other friends (which in hindsight should have been a major red flag, but I was 9). I brushed it off and assumed that she just wanted to make sure that we should always be friends. 

Fifth grade was when Iz started getting worse. We would have differing opinions often and whenever I would express this to Iz she would hit me on the head. Not lightly or playfully either,  just hard and aggressive. I tried telling hart to stop and that she why's hurting me. She would do similar things to El but I would always get the extreme end. 

Now when El started to stand up for herself and not be bullied by Iz I was only targeted more. When El left ore school was when Iz became the worst. Still the worst thing that Iz had done was straight up choked me for calling her a bitch when she was belittling my issues (I'll admit it wasn't the smartest choice). There were other things that Iz did but this was really when I finally retaliated. I finally had enough of her and I switched schoold soon after that incident. It was also around this time when I had completely cut Iz out of my life. And when I did this she told me that she was glad that I left. This still hurt me a lot considering that I was still willing to be acquaintances.

Fast forward to now El and Iz have still talked beggar they go to the same youth group. But El would always reassure me that I was her best friend and that she liked me better than Iz. But lately we'll had been speaking about Iz positively more and more. I've expressed how I feel about Iz but El still seems to like her despite what she had done to both of us. Now el says that Iz is her best friend and sister and that she is  glad to have Iz in her life. 

I still live spending time with El but I just don't know if I can still be ad close with her knowing that she treats the girl who tried to kill me (or at least make me pass out) like a sister. Am I the asshole?

TL;DR: I don't want to be as close with a girl who I've been friends with since first grade because she treats my abuser like a sister."	Not the A-hole	0	0
by3x9l	2019-06-08 04:15:13	Kukero	AITA scolding my friend after she doesn't block her ex?	"Ok, so my friend got broken up with like two weeks ago. It was over text and the guy did it on a Saturday night (that's already a bad sign.) The weekend went by, and then we got back to school. My friend found out more about why her ex broke up with her. (He lost feelings for her earlier on in the relationship, and liked someone else). This would've been enough to make her like at least force herself to stop thinking about this guy, right? Wrong. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. It's summer. I'm texting my friend, and we're joking around and stuff. It was all good. Until my friend got a text from her ex. Apparently he mistook her for someone else, his new girlfriend, which I don't entirely believe. My friend gets upset about this, which I knew would happen. 

I try to explain how she shouldn't have left his number unblocked in the first place. She said that she thought she was making progress, but didn't want to block him, because their conversations would be deleted, and she likes looking back at them. I pointed out that if she never blocks him, and still looks back through messages, there isn't much progress being done there.

 But then she just doesn't respond. Just leaves me on opened (this conversation is having on Snapchat). Not like I'm surprised. Whenever we have these conversations, she just ignores me until the next day. But, whatever ig.

AITA in this situation or nah? I hope I explained it well."	No A-holes here	0	0

by3u3j	2019-06-08 04:05:10		AITA for strongly disliking my bigender bandmate?	"TL;DR at bottom although I don’t think this is that long.

Context: I’m part of the leadership team for the marching band at my school, and since it is the end of the school year, we need to interview next year’s candidates. I’m a sophomore and am in the middle level band.

So we are doing the interviews and the individual in question comes in. I knew this individual as a female from freshman year when we were in the same band. Back then her name was, let’s just say, Kelly. Also all of the following names are substitutes as well.

So they walk in and our band director asks “so what are you going by today? Kelly, Hannah, Jessica?” And the person says “no, it’s actually Dylan today.” At this point I’m like WTF because I still remember this person only as Kelly from last year. 

So I whisper to my friend who is in the same band as them and he says “Oh yeah they’re gender neutral so they change their name every day depending on what they are feeling like that day.” 

Now I live in a very liberal area where the LGBTQ community is very much accepted. I am in full support of this community. However, I think that changing your name depending on what you feel is taking it way too far. By extension I strongly dislike Kelly/Dylan (yes we have to write both names with a slash when referring to this person on paper. Oh and also don’t even ask about all the other names because I have no idea).

TL;DR: Classmate is bigender and switches their name daily according to what they feel that day.

AITA for disliking them?

P.S. If this blows up, I have a lot more background info on this person which I can share, but I doubt it will."		1	0

BACKGROUND INFO: We had to make a poem with certain requirements, and my friend asked me to join her. We had a lot of time and decided to work on it the night it was due. The poem she made wasn’t so amazing, but I wasn’t sure if I wanted to continue working with her, so I made my own poem, just in case. I kind of let our poem be, just because. She is now mad at me because we kind of cut off ties and she’ll be receiving, “late points.” Do I apologize?	Asshole	0	0
